business,China's property sector stalked by Evergrande default fears," HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Debt-saddled Chinese property firms took heavy fire in bond markets on Tuesday, after the poster child of the sector's woes, Evergrande Group A wave of developers face payment deadlines before the end of the year and with Evergrande's fate looking increasingly bleak, fears are mounting of a wider crisis. Weary Evergrande bondholders still haven't received almost $150 million worth of coupon payments that had been due on Monday, although there was little surprise after the firm had skipped two other payments in recent weeks. Evergrande didn't reply to a Reuters request for comment. It has maintained radio silence for weeks and markets are now counting down to a Oct. 18-19 deadline when it will be formally declared in default if it still hasn't stumped up. ""It is pretty serious now and it looks like it is going to be long and drawn out process,"" said London-based Trium Capital fund manager Peter Kisler about Evergrande and the wider crisis. ""I don't see the recovery being particularly high,"" he said referring to what Evergrande bondholders would get if Evergrande gets broken up. ""I think 20 cents (for every dollar of the bonds' original face value) is more or less fair."" Problems have already spread well beyond just Evergrande. Mid-sized rival Fantasia LOOMING DEADLINES Refinitiv data shows there is at least $92.3 billion worth of Chinese property developers' bonds coming due next year. Seaport Global's EM Corporate Credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said the key dates and payments to watch this year were: Oct. 15 - Shimao Oct. 15 - Xinyuan Oct. 18 - Sinic Oct. 27 - Seazen Holdings Nov. 8 - Central China Real Estate Nov. 18 - Agile Nov. 18 - Zhenro Dec. 3 - Ronshine China Dec. 7 - Kaisa Dec. 17 - Fantasia The $5 trillion Chinese property sector, accounts for around a quarter of the Chinese economy by some metrics and is often a major factor in Beijing policymaking. ""We see more defaults ahead if the liquidity problem does not improve markedly,"" said brokerage CGS-CIMB in a note, adding developers with weaker credit ratings would find it very difficult to refinance debt at the moment. Shanghai Stock Exchange data showed the top five losers among exchange-traded bonds in morning deals were all issued by property firms. Modern Land's dollar bond due for repayment in 2023  plunged 25% to 32.250 cents on the dollar, while Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, and Greenland Holdings, which wants to build western Europe's tallest residential building, both saw more savage selling. , It wasn't all one-way traffic. Sinic's bond due in 2022  rose 12% to 19.35 cents. That still left its yield - a proxy of its likely borrowing cost if it were to try and tap financial markets - at over 1,380%. Some of Central China Real Estate's bonds due next month also gained. Modern Land, whose shares dropped over 3% to new low on Tuesday, asked bondholders on Monday to delay for three months a repayment due later this month, while Sinic said it would likely default next week. BROADER FALLOUT? Market indicators also show how contagion is slowly spreading to other high yield markets in the developing world. Trium's Kisler highlighted how most emerging market companies whose yields were already around the 10% mark have been hit and even riskier sovereign markets like Ecuador may be suffering some blowback. The cost of insuring against a China sovereign default also continued to rise on Tuesday, with 5-year credit default swaps  - which investors typically use as a hedge against rising risk - hitting their highest since April 2020. Shares of several other property firms, however, fared better as markets bet on more loosening of policies following northeastern city of Harbin's measures to support developers and their projects.

business,American Airlines sees smaller-than-expected loss as travel picks up," Oct 12 (Reuters) - American Airlines U.S. carriers had tempered their outlooks for the September quarter as the Delta coronavirus variant slowed new bookings and drove up cancellations, but a recent fall in COVID-19 cases has raised hopes that passengers would be confident to fly again. The Biden administration's plan to reopen the United States in November to air travelers from Europe has added to the optimism. The trans-Atlantic route is one of the most lucrative ones in the world and accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenues for the big three U.S. carriers.

business,Explainer: What a U.S. debt ceiling extension means for bond markets," NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Gridlock over the U.S. debt ceiling may have been temporarily resolved, but a longer-term solution has also been deferred. Last week's truce appeased the bond market a bit, but investors are still eyeing default risks ahead of a new December deadline. WHAT IS THE DEBT CEILING NOW? After weeks of wrangling, the That will give Congress more time to pass a longer-term debt ceiling extension through reconciliation, analysts said. BofA Securities, in a research note, said it believes U.S. Treasury funding could go beyond December and into January or even February. WHAT DOES THE U.S. TREASURY NEED TO PAY OUT OF THE DEBT LIMIT INCREASE? The U.S. Treasury is expected to spend about two-thirds of the $480 billion of new borrowing authority fairly soon. Money market research firm Wrightson Capital, in a research note, said the Treasury, by law, must reinstate trust fund balances that had been disinvested during a ""debt issuance suspension period"" (DISP). The Treasury's latest weekly debt ceiling activity report last Friday showed government trust funds were owed $301 billion in  non-marketable securities as of Oct. 6. Wrightson said replacing those trust fund securities will leave the Treasury with less than $200 billion of traditional borrowing authority when the debt ceiling increase officially takes effect later this week. WOULD THE TREASURY STILL BE ABLE TO TAP INTO EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES IF THE $480 BILLION RUNS OUT? Estimates from Wrightson showed the Treasury is likely to use up the remainder of its regular borrowing by the first week of November. If so, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen may have to declare a new DISP, which would allow the department to tap into its extraordinary measures again. That gives the Treasury roughly $300 billion of accounting flexibility, which should be adequate to cover possibly all of its borrowing needs, for the remainder of the year, Wrightson said. WILL TREASURY BILL SUPPLY INCREASE WITH THE RISE IN DEBT LIMIT? BofA Securities projects there could be a more than a $300 billion near-term increase in bill supply after the short-term debt limit is signed into law. This estimate is based on Treasury's existing and target cash balances. The bills will likely take the form of one-month and short-dated cash management bills. WHAT ARE THE NEAR-TERM MARKET IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEBT LIMIT EXTENSION? As a result of the extension, the risk of a short-term debt default has eased, if not deferred to December. The thinly traded one-year credit default swaps  that would pay off in case of a U.S. government default traded at 14.9 basis points last Friday, after spiking to 28 basis points before the debt limit increase. Yields on U.S. bills, with late October maturities, have also fallen. For instance, the yield on the Oct. 26 maturity  fell to 4 basis points last Friday, from as high as nearly 20 basis points last week. The pressure, however, has shifted to the early December maturities, where yields have doubled. The yield on the December 7 maturity  rose to 8 basis points last Friday, from 4 basis points a week earlier. Outside of the bill market, however, there are few signs of stress. In the U.S. repurchase (repo) market, investors are keeping a close eye on the Treasury bill collateral pledged to them in both overnight and term trades. Barclays, in a research note, wrote that while lenders are watching debt ceiling-sensitive CUSIPs, or identification numbers, they have not excluded them from the eligibility list. That suggests some expectation of a debt ceiling resolution.

business,"Americans may not get some Christmas treats, White House officials warn"," WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - White House officials, scrambling to relieve global supply bottlenecks choking U.S. ports, highways and railways, warn Americans may face higher prices and some empty shelves this Christmas season. The supply crisis, driven in part by the global COVID pandemic, not only The latest Reuters/Ipsos The White House has been trying to tackle inflation-inducing supply bottlenecks of everything from meat to semiconductors, and formed a task force in June that meets weekly and named a ""bottleneck"" czar to push private sector companies to ease snarls. Still, supply chain woes are weighing on retail and transportation companies, which recently American consumers, unused to empty store shelves, may need to be flexible and patient, White House officials said. ""There will be things that people can't get,"" a senior White House official told Reuters, when asked about holiday shopping. ""At the same time, a lot of these goods are hopefully substitutable by other things ... I don't think there's any real reason to be panicked, but we all feel the frustration and there's a certain need for patience to help get through a relatively short period of time."" Inflation is biting wages. Labor Department data shows that Americans made 0.9% less per hour on average in August than they did one year prior. The White House argues inflation is a sign that their decision to provide historic support to small businesses and households, through $1.9 trillion in COVID-19 relief funding, worked. U.S. consumer demand stayed strong, outpacing global rivals, and the Biden administration expects the overall economy to grow at 7.1%, as inflation reaches its highest levels since the 1980s. ""We recognize that it has pinched families who are trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy as we move into the later stages of the pandemic,"" said a second senior White House official. BOTTLENECK CZAR In August, the White House tapped John Porcari, a veteran transportation official who served in the Obama administration as a new ""envoy"" to the nation's ports, but he's known as the bottleneck czar. Porcari told Reuters the administration has worked to make sure various parts of the supply chain, such as ports and intermodal facilities, where freight is transferred from one form of transport to another, are in steady communication. Now it is focused on getting ports and other transportation hubs to operate on a 24-hour schedule, taking advantage of off-peak hours to move more goods in the pipeline. California ports in Long Beach and Los Angeles have agreed to extended hours, and there are more to follow, he said in an interview Monday. ""We need to make better use of that off-peak capacity and that really is the current focus,"" Porcari said. The administration is also seeking to restore inactive rail yards for extra container capacity and create ""pop-up"" rail yards to increase capacity. ""It's important to remember that the goods movement system is a private sector driven system,"" he said. ""There's problems in every single part of that system. And, and they tend to compound each other. ""While the pandemic was an enormously disruptive force. I think it also laid bare what was an underlying reality, which was the system was strained before the pandemic."" A NEW WAR ON CHRISTMAS Republican strategists are seizing on possible Christmas shortages to bash Biden's policies as inflationary, and thwart his attempt to push a multi-trillion dollar spending package through Congress in coming weeks. A recent op-ed by Steve Cortes, a one-time advisor to former President Donald Trump, dubbed the upcoming holiday season ""Biden's Blue Christmas,"" continuing in a long tradition of conservatives criticizing Democrats over celebrations around the Christian holiday. Trump, considered the front-runner Republican candidate for president in 2024, blasted it out in a mass email through his political action committee, Save America. Seth Weathers, a Republican strategist who ran Trump's Georgia campaign in 2016 said they see local impact. ""People here in Georgia are paying twice as much for items than they paid a year ago and they are blaming Biden. He's in charge."" A Quinnipiac poll released last week showed Biden is losing the public's trust on the economy, with only 29% of public thinking the U.S. economy is in ""good"" or ""excellent"" condition, compared with 35% in April. ""President Biden could use a holiday season win,"" Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy said. ""A slowdown of holiday season deliveries and the financial strain that comes with it would be coal in the stocking for the Administration at the close of the first year in office.""

business,GSK on track with consumer split as buyout report boosts shares," Oct 12 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline The division, which makes Sensodyne toothpaste, and Advil and Panadol painkillers, could also draw interest from big pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies, the report It added the unit could be valued at 40 billion pounds ($54 billion) or more. A GSK spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had received takeover interest in the division, a joint venture with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer The report sent London-listed GSK's shares as much as 4.8% higher to 1,460.2 pence. ""GSK is far advanced with its plan for the separation of Consumer Healthcare,"" the GSK representative said, adding the drugmaker was on course for the split in mid-2022. The company set out plans in June to turn the consumer arm into a separately listed company to focus on its underperforming drugs business, and has defended those plans after activist investor Elliott ""The feedback we have received from our shareholders is that they are very keen to own the new Consumer Healthcare company as a listed entity through the demerger ... The GSK board will fulfil its fiduciary duties to evaluate any alternative options,"" GSK's spokesperson said. Under GSK's plan, shareholders will receive stock in the new consumer health group amounting to at least 80% of the 68% stake that GSK currently owns in it. Pfizer owns the remaining 32%. New GSK would sell the remaining 20% stake ""in a timely manner,"" the group has said. Pfizer has also said it would seek to exit its shareholding. Elliott, which in July confirmed holding a significant stake in GSK, said then that a conservative estimate would value GSK's shareholding in the consumer unit at about 34 billion pounds - working out to roughly 50 billion pounds overall. Brokerage Jefferies has valued it at 45 billion pounds. Another activist investor, Bluebell Capital Partners, which holds a smaller stake in GSK, said last month the consumer arm should attract interest from trade buyers and, potentially, private equity investors. Elliott has said a sale of the unit to an industry peer would command a ""meaningful premium"" to its estimated value due to potential synergies of up to 10% of the business's revenues. Separately, Bluebell said in an open letter to GSK Chairman Jonathan Symonds dated Oct. 11, that both he and Chief Executive Emma Walmsley should be replaced, voicing disappointment over an Oct. 7 investor event. ""We completely reject the content and claims made in this letter, which are not representative of the discussion at the meeting or the majority of our shareholders' views,"" GSK said in response.

business,"IMF says economic policymakers need to juggle continued support, risks"," WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Policymakers worldwide are entering a tricky phase of the pandemic recovery and should take care to provide continued economic support without promoting instability in financial markets, the International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday. Nearly 20 months into the global pandemic, many countries including the United States are now thinking about how to pull back from extraordinary economic stimulus, a process that itself carries risks of unsettling global markets. In its latest Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF urged policymakers to ""act decisively"" and target continued economic support tailored to their countries' needs. Prompt action and clear communication ahead of any policy shifts will be critical to ensure economic support gets where it is needed without encouraging inflation or increasing volatility, the group warned. ""Policymakers are confronted with a challenging trade-off: maintaining near-term support for the global economy while preventing unintended consequences and medium-term financial stability risks,"" the report stated. It flagged some early ""warning signs"" of instability, pointing to increased financial risk-taking and fragilities among nonbanks, such as life insurance funds. In recent weeks, markets have been unsettled by fears of a potential default by Chinese property giant Evergrande, as well as by soaring energy prices which have seen some energy companies collapse. The IMF said policymakers must ""urgently"" address fragilities and potential increases in market volatility. ""If left unchecked, these vulnerabilities may evolve into structural legacy problems, putting medium-term growth at risk and testing the resilience of the global financial system,"" the report stated. The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies also poses several risks to investors and policymakers, the IMF added. It said ""stablecoins,"" digital currencies pegged to traditional currencies, generally have poor disclosure and could be prone to runs if their value comes under doubt. Emerging markets could face ""destabilizing capital flows"" as cryptocurrencies are used to circumvent exchange restrictions and capital controls, it added. ""A sound regulatory framework for crypto assets, and decentralized finance markets more generally, must be a priority on the global policy agenda,"" the report stated. Regarding climate change, the IMF said policymakers should prioritize a more robust sustainable finance regulatory framework -- including data and other disclosure requirements -- to encourage the private sector to boost investments in cleaner energy sources. Our Standards: Persistent supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures are constraining the global economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as it cut growth outlooks for the United States and other major industrial powers."
business,Talks to remove digital taxes should end tariff risks -U.S. Treasury officials," WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Negotiations over the withdrawal of existing digital services taxes after a landmark corporate tax deal should ultimately end the threat of tariff wars between the United States and several countries over the levies, U.S. Treasury officials said. In the In return, the deal requires all countries to remove unilateral digital services taxes (DST) that largely targeted U.S. technology giants. It also prohibits new digital levies immediately until the agreement enters into force or the end of 2023. Transitional arrangements for removing DSTs ""are being discussed expeditiously."" The Treasury officials told reporters on a conference call that talks over the details of these arrangements were expected to obviate the need for the United States to pursue retaliatory tariffs countries that have imposed digital services taxes. The U.S. Trade representative's office has Proposed tariffs on One of the Treasury officials said the department was coordinating closely with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office on the digital tariff removals. Another Treasury official said that implementation for the reallocation of taxing rights, known as ""Pillar 1"" of the OECD agreement, could take several months to complete, and that the Treasury envisions that it will be done with bipartisan support. Senior U.S. Senate Republicans have argued that this would require a new international tax treaty, which would require ratification with a two-thirds Senate majority. They told Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in The U.S. Treasury official said that the Pillar 1 agreement was designed in a way to appeal to both parties, providing tax certainty for U.S. businesses without compromising U.S. revenue. The official said it was premature to consider passage without bipartisan support, but did not say whether a treaty would be required.

business,'Desperate for tires.' Components shortage roils U.S. harvest," CHICAGO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Dale Hadden cannot find any spare tires for his combine harvester. So the Illinois farmer told his harvest crew to avoid driving on the sides of roads this autumn to avoid metal scraps that could shred tires. New Ag Supply in Kansas is pleading with customers to order parts now for spring planting. And in Iowa, farmer Cordt Holub is locking up his machinery inside his barn each night, after thieves stole hard-to-find tractor parts from a local Deere & Co ""You try to baby your equipment, but we're all at the mercy of luck right now,"" said Holub, a fourth-generation corn and soybean farmer in Buckingham, Iowa. Manufacturing meltdowns are hitting the U.S. heartland, as the Farmers say they are scrambling to find workarounds when their machinery breaks, tracking down local welders and mechanics. Growers looking to buy tractors and combines online are asking for close-up photos of the machine's tires, because replacements are expensive and difficult to find, said Greg Peterson, founder of the Machinery Pete website which hosts farm equipment auctions. ""As harvest ends, we will see farmers at equipment auctions not for the machinery - but for parts,"" Peterson said. ""We're already hearing from guys talking about buying a second planter or sprayer, just for parts."" For some farmers, the shortages are forcing them to reuse - or repair - old parts. At their small welding shop in western Washington, Rami and Bob Warburton can barely keep up with all the orders from farmers needing something repaired from fittings for irrigation systems to a cracked bulldozer bucket. ""We were in the middle of a drought up here,"" Rami Warburton said. ""At that time, they couldn't wait to water their fields for a month. The crops will be dead by then."" 'TYLENOL MOMENTS' Kinks in the supply chain The Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer, a monthly measure of farmer economic sentiment, fell 10% to its lowest level since July 2020 in early October. Supply concerns are weighing heavily on growers, with 55% of farmers surveyed saying that low inventories have affected their plans to buy machinery. Access to steel, plastic, rubber and other raw materials has been scarce during the pandemic, and manufacturers are preparing for even more shocks after When executives from farm machinery maker AGCO Corp Toornman said staff levels are dropping at some suppliers in the Dakotas, Nebraska and Texas, as workers object to President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate, drop out of the workforce for fear of getting COVID-19 or move to other jobs. ""It's the perfect storm of Tylenol moments,"" Toornman said. ""It's one headache after another."" The supply squeeze has put particular pressure on equipment dealerships, who typically see their service business boom during the traditional September through November harvest season. This year, some have resorted to sifting through decade-old inventory for solutions. One pain point for dealerships is an industry-wide shortage of GPS receivers, which are used to run tractor guidance and data systems. At Ag-Pro, the largest privately-owned Deere & Co dealership in North America, staff in Ohio have been digging out GPS units that date back to 2004. Until now, they were essentially worthless. But producers can still use them to record a digital harvest map of their farms ??something many need when talking to their bankers, landlords and crop insurance agents. COMPONENTS TRIAGE Equipment manufacturers are faced with a painful choice this harvest season: Send parts to factories to build new tractors and combines to sell to farmers or redirect those parts into the field to repair broken equipment for existing customers? For AGCO and rival manufacturer CNH Industrial N.V. ""You can't afford not to support those customers in the field,"" AGCO's Toornman said. ""When you're harvesting, timing is everything."" CNH estimates that supply chain constraints ranging from increases in freight to higher raw materials prices have cost the company $1 billion. That lag has forced the company to turn some factory parking lots into storage lots. At CNH's combine plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, hundreds of unfinished combines sit outside, waiting for parts. Meanwhile, CNH is redirecting components that can be used on its Case IH and New Holland equipment to customers in the field, a company representative said. CNH has been signaling to dealers that supply chain problems and parts shortages for Case IH farm equipment are ongoing, according to Reuters interviews with six dealers. The manufacturer said in a statement it is meeting customer needs ""the best we can given these unprecedented challenges."" Deere said it is reorganizing shipping containers to make more room for goods, leasing extra cranes to expedite unloading ships at ports, and expanding its trucking fleet. But component shortages are ""particularly challenging for farmers facing what is already a short window of time to harvest,"" said Luke Gakstatter, senior vice president of Deere's aftermarket and customer support. In some cases, the company has delivered unfinished machinery to customers. Missouri farmer Andy Kapp's brand new combine rolled off the assembly line missing some of the high-tech cameras that help provide the very efficiency he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for. But he is using it anyway, and even has stocked up on some extra parts, in case the combine breaks down. ""As you get toward the end of harvest, machinery and people get more tired,"" Kapp said. ""It's a new machine. It won't surprise us if there are a few loose bolts.""

business,IMF cuts global growth outlook as supply bottlenecks hobble pandemic recovery," WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Persistent supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures are constraining the global economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as it cut growth outlooks for the United States and other major industrial powers. In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF trimmed its 2021 global growth forecast to 5.9% from the 6.0% forecast it made in July. It left a 2022 global growth forecast unchanged at 4.9%. ""This modest headline revision, however, masks large downgrades for some countries,"" the IMF said in the report, adding that worsening pandemic dynamics have darkened the outlook for low-income developing economies, while wealthy countries are struggling with supply disruptions. The IMF said it expects elevated inflation to subside to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. But the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, signaled that the global lender is growing more concerned about persistent inflation, saying: ""Central banks should be prepared to act quickly if the risks of rising inflation expectations become more material in this uncharted recovery."" Gopinath, speaking in a virtual news conference, said policymakers needed to be ""particularly vigilant"" for signs that wage inflation is spreading more broadly from certain sectors and whether rising housing prices are contributing to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. But she cautioned against comparisons to 1970s-style ""stagflation,"" noting that underlying demand was strong, and problems were mainly on the supply side. Global manufacturing activity U.S. GROWTH SLOWDOWN The United States is taking the brunt of these effects, and the IMF slashed its 2021 U.S. growth forecast by a full percentage point, to 6.0%, from 7.0% in July - a level that was seen as the U.S. growth could shrink further, the IMF said, because its forecasts assume a deeply divided U.S. Congress will approve President Joe Biden's proposed infrastructure and social spending worth $4 trillion over a decade. Lawmakers now are trying to achieve consensus on a smaller package, and the IMF said a significant reduction would reduce growth prospects for the United States and its trading partners. The report, which was issued at the outset of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings, also cut growth forecasts for other industrial economies. German growth was reduced by half a percentage point from the July forecast to 3.1% while Japan's growth was lowered 0.4 point to 2.4%. The IMF's forecast for British growth this year fell only 0.2 point to 6.8%, giving it the fastest growth forecast among the G7 economies. China's 2021 growth forecast was trimmed by 0.1 point to 8.0%, as the IMF cited a faster-than-expected scaleback of public investment spending. India's forecast was unchanged at 9.5%, but prospects in other emerging Asian countries have been diminished due to a worsening of the pandemic. The IMF cut its forecast by 1.4 points for the ""ASEAN-5"" grouping of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Some commodity-exporting countries such as Nigeria and Saudi Arabia saw modest growth upgrades due to higher oil and commodity prices. VACCINE DIVIDE The report also warned of a dangerous divergence in economic prospects fueled by ""the great vaccine divide,"" with low-income countries, where 96% of the population remains unvaccinated, facing lower growth for longer periods, more poverty, and the prospect of de-anchored inflation expectations. ""About 65 million to 75 million additional people are estimated to be in extreme poverty in 2021 compared to pre-pandemic projections,"" the report said, adding that low-income countries largely in Africa needed some $250 billion in additional spending to fight COVID-19 and regain their pre-pandemic growth path. Currently, these countries are forecast to have cumulative output next year that is 6.7% below pre-pandemic levels. Advanced economies, meanwhile, will have 2022 output nearly 1% above pre-pandemic levels, the IMF said.

business,Samsung leader Lee admits in court to unlawful sedative use," SEOUL, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Samsung conglomerate chief Jay Y. Lee admitted in court on Tuesday to unlawful use of a controlled substance, as the executive's legal troubles continued despite his release on parole in August after a bribery conviction. Lee appeared at the Seoul Central District Court where, in a short first hearing, he said he received propofol - a sedative used in anaesthesia - 41 times from 2015 through 2020. His release in August had raised expectations of major decisions being taken at Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Prosecutors, who are seeking a fine of 70 million won ($58,327) and an additional fee of 17 million won, said that Lee had been administered propofol under the guise of a skin treatment or unrelated to a legitimate treatment. ""This matter originated as for treatment, but I am deeply regretful,"" Lee said. ""I will ... make sure that this does not happen again,"" Lee told the small court, where about 15 people were present, adding he had not used the drug since his release. Lee's lawyer told the court that Lee had received treatment for medical purposes, originally due to psychological pressure after the hospitalisation of his father and then as a result of the graft scandal and trial leading to his January conviction. The court ruling is scheduled for Oct 26. Under South Korean law, the recipient of a controlled substance deemed to have been administered illegally is liable for prosecution, as well as those who administered the drug. Staff at a clinic where Lee received the sedative, who are being tried separately, have denied wrongdoing. Prosecutors were first made aware of the matter in 2020 but were advised to drop their investigation in March 2021 by an independent panel reviewing prosecution probes. They continued to seek a fine as recently as June before another police report of sedative use led the court to order a hearing. As propofol is less likely to be misused than many other controlled substances, many similar cases of unlawful use have resulted in fines rather than jail terms. Lee was convicted in January of bribery and embezzlement and sentenced to 30 months in jail - including a year served before his sentencing.

business,Japan confronts rising inequality after Abenomics," TOKYO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Japan's stock market has surged and luxury cars are selling fast in Tokyo after eight years of economic stimulus under Abenomics, but that new wealth is concentrated in a small slice of society rather than broadly distributed, data show. Addressing that divide has become a high priority for new prime minister Fumio Kishida, who promised to tackle income disparity made worse by the pandemic. But he has offered few clues as to how he will do so. ""It's like everyone has become poor,"" said Masanori Aoki, 62, who owns a small coffee shop in a working class district of northeast Tokyo. ""With Abenomics, the finance minister talked about wealth trickling down. But there was no such thing, was there? Almost nothing,"" said Aoki, who took a job as a part-time kindergarten bus driver when the COVID-19 pandemic forced him to temporarily shut down his shop. Kimie Kobayashi, 55, who works at a childcare facility in Tokyo, says her wages haven't risen for four years. She said many who work in the industry are resigned to the fact that salaries rarely increase. ""I can't say that my livelihood is getting any better,"" said Kobayashi. ""The government collects tax but that money isn't used to help people who are really in need."" Abenomics - a dose of huge monetary, fiscal support and a growth strategy that boosted stocks and corporate profits - failed to create wealth to households via higher wages, data show. Japan's poverty rate is the second-highest among G7 nations and the ninth-highest among OECD countries, according to the organisation's survey, based on data available up to 2020. Nominal wages rose just 1.2% from 2012 through 2020, To be sure, inequality is far more pronounced in countries such as the United States and Britain. Japan stood around the middle of 39 countries surveyed by OECD in 2020 based on the Gini coefficient, which gauges inequality. The situation did improve for some in Japan. Manabu Fujisaki recently splurged on a 7 million yen ($61,800) Mercedes-Benz after reaping a huge sum from investing in cryptocurrencies. ""Abenomics brought us investors huge profits as (central bank) money-pumping pushed up prices of financial securities,"" said Fujisaki, 34, a father of two who plans to build a 200 million yen house in Tokyo next year. Department store Takashimaya says there is brisk demand for Patek Philippe watches that cost more than 10 million yen, and Baccarat chandeliers worth a few million yen. Alfa Romeo sold 84 of its speciality models, with a price tag exceeding 20 million yen, during the Golden Week holidays in late April through early May - making Japan its top-selling market globally. Alfa Romeo sales in April-September more than doubled from year-before levels. Sales of other import brands like Ferrari, Jaguar and Maserati also increased, industry data showed. ""We're seeing a clear rise in demand for luxury goods among the new rich,"" said Takahiro Koike, a manager at the department store Isetan, referring to a newly wealthy young entrepreneurs and other high earners. Kishida hopes to narrow the wealth disparity by forming a ""new type of capitalism"" that includes higher wages for public health and medical workers, and tax incentives to firms that raise pay. But achieving what a wall of money under Abenomics failed to do would be challenging. Already, Kishida shelved a plan to Shigeto Nagai, an economist at Oxford Economics, said offering shot-term tax breaks likely will not convince firms to raise wages, calling instead for reforms in areas such as Japan's rigid labour system. ""First and foremost, politicians must abandon the unrealistic and optimistic premise of Abenomics that Japan can cure all ills just by reflating nominal growth,"" Nagai said.

business,IMF board backs Georgieva after review of data-rigging claims," WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's executive board on Monday expressed its full confidence in Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva after reviewing allegations that she pressured World Bank staff to alter data to favor China. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen The Fund's 24-member board and Treasury issued separate lengthy statements after a week of marathon meetings over Georgieva's actions as World Bank CEO that threw into question her continued leadership of the IMF. Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist and the first person from a developing country to head the fund, had vehemently denied the claims. She welcomed the board's endorsement in a separate statement of her own and she said was pleased its members had agreed the allegations against her were unfounded. ""This has obviously been a difficult episode for me personally,"" she said. ""However, I want to express my unyielding support for the independence and integrity of institutions such as the World Bank and IMF; and my respect for all those committed to protecting the values on which these organizations are founded."" Georgieva had won the support of France and other European governments last week, but U.S. and Japanese officials pushed for a more thorough review of the allegations, according to sources briefed on the matter. At issue was a damning report prepared by the law firm WilmerHale for the World Bank's board about data irregularities in the bank's now-canceled ""Doing Business"" report. The firm's Georgieva The board said the information presented during its review - which included meetings with WilmerHale attorneys and Georgieva - did not conclusively demonstrate that she played an improper role in the Doing Business report. European governments had sought a speedy resolution of the matter ahead of this week's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, where Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass are leading discussions on the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, debt relief and efforts to speed vaccinations. The United States and Japan, the fund's two largest shareholders, cautioned against prematurely reconfirming confidence in the IMF leader, said one of the sources. 'LEGITIMATE ISSUES' Yellen spoke with Georgieva on Monday about the ""serious issues"" raised by the probe and underscored her commitment to ""preserve the integrity and credibility of the World Bank and the IMF,"" Treasury said in a statement. While the report ""raised legitimate issues and concerns,"" Treasury said it agreed with other board members that ""absent further direct evidence with regard to the role of the Managing Director there is not a basis for a change in IMF leadership."" Yellen told Georgieva the WilmerHale report showed the need for shareholders to be vigilant in defending the integrity of both institutions, and said the IMF should renew their commitment to upholding transparency and whistleblower protections. No matter who is to blame for the altered data, current and former staff from both institutions say the Malpass declined on Monday to comment on the IMF process, but said the Our Standards: Debt-saddled Chinese property firms took heavy fire in bond markets on Tuesday, after the poster child of the sector's woes, Evergrande Group , missed its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and others warned of defaults."
business,U.N.'s Carney calls for multilateral development banks to up climate ambition," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The world's multilateral development banks need to ""up their ambition"" in terms of the financing provided for climate-related projects, United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney said on Tuesday. Speaking in a podcast ""In climate finance, if something's not going to scale to 100 billion a year in the medium term, it's not interesting, it's niche; that's how big the numbers are,"" Carney said. ""So I think the MDBs need to be thinking in those terms, designing programs that are scalable, that can reach those levels."" Looking ahead to the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow in November, Carney said the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a group of financial institutions working to reduce emissions, would unveil a plan to help. ""(We) will be making some explicit proposals for that and hopefully we'll get traction with it."" On Monday, GFANZ issued a separate call to action for governments to enact a suite of policy changes the group said would help accelerate the world's transition to a low-carbon economy. The comments follow criticism from some quarters that development finance institutions have not done enough to help encourage more private sector capital to be deployed in the fight against climate change, particularly in poorer countries. Earlier this year, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink called for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to be reformed so they would provide more first-loss capital to help bring down the cost of financing for private investors.

business,China's export growth likely eased in Sept on electricity curbs: Reuters poll," BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China's export growth likely slowed in September as electricity rationing hit production at home, while a shift in consumption towards services as developed economies reopened likely reduced global appetite for Chinese goods, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. Exports are expected to have risen 21.0% in September from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 30 economists in the poll, after growing 25.6% in August. Imports also slowed, while China's trade surplus narrowed, the Reuters poll showed. A widening power shortage in China, caused by the country's transition to clean energy, booming industrial demand and high commodity prices, have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying big global brands such as Apple China's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in September due to wider curbs on electricity and elevated input prices, according to an official survey. ""China's power rationing is likely to continue into Q1 2022 as environmental policies collide with shortages of fuel and renewables,"" said Jian Chang, chief China economist at Barclays. ""We believe residential users will be prioritised through the winter, with ramifications for factory output."" The electricity curbs could further inflate the cost pressures facing Chinese exporters who are already grappling with squeezed profit margins due to supply bottlenecks and rising labour costs, analysts say. Small firms caught in China's prolonged energy crunch are turning to diesel generators, which are more expensive than government electricity supply, or simply shutting shop. After a rapid recovery from the pandemic-induced slump, China's economy has been slowing since the second half of this year, fuelling expectations that the government may need to roll out more support measures. Imports likely rose 20% in September from a year ago, the poll showed, after increasing 33.1% growth in August. Nomura analysts said higher oil prices and a strong yuan appreciation since mid-2020 would likely underpin the overall value of imports, although recent declines in the prices of a few commodities may pose a downside risk.

business,Toyota aims to make up some lost production as supplies rebound -sources," TOKYO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp Toyota last month cut its production target for the financial year to end-March by 300,000 vehicles to 9 million units because rising COVID-19 infections slowed work at parts factories in Malaysia and Vietnam, compounding a global chip shortage that has forced it and other big automakers to curtail output. The Japanese carmaker has asked suppliers to make up for lost production so it can build an additional 97,000 vehicles between December and the end of March, with some considering additional weekend shifts 
                to do so, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to talk to the media. ""Nothing has yet been decided about production plans beyond November,"" a Toyota spokesperson said. ""COVID infection rates in Southeast Asia are dropping dramatically and people's concerns about production risk are easing,"" said Takashi Miyao, a researcher at automotive industry consultant Carnorama. ""It looks like the industry is emerging from a tunnel,"" he added. Toyota, which had hardened its supply chain against disruptions after the 2011 earthquake that devastated Japan's northeast coast, was the last of the major automakers to revise down production plans because of parts shortages. The pandemic forced component factories to close while also driving up demand for semiconductors that carmakers needed as people forced to stay home bought tablets and other electronic devices. With too few parts, automakers have been unable to take advantage of a rebound in demand for cars in key markets such as China. Vehicle sales there in September dipped by a fifth from a year earlier.

business,Stocks and bonds struggle under stagflation threat," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Signs that soaring energy prices are putting a dampener on economic growth kept a lid on global stock market gains on Tuesday, while inflation and policy-tightening fears sent short-dated U.S. Treasury yields to 18-month highs. Oil prices rose further, with Brent crude above $84 a barrel . Coal has scaled record peaks and, while gas prices are off recent highs, they remain four times higher in Europe than at the start of the year. The impact of supply crunches in power and manufacturing components is showing up in data - figures on Tuesday showed Japanese wholesale inflation hit 13-year highs last month, British shoppers slashed spending, China recorded a 20% drop in car sales and bottlenecks dragged German economic sentiment down for a fifth month. Stock markets were trying to claw back earlier hefty losses, with a pan-European equity index S&P 500 and the Dow futures flatlined however ,  and MSCI's global index slipped 0.2% Earlier, Asian shares lost ground, led by falls of as much as 1.5% in Chinese blue chips With the U.S. earnings season kicking off in earnest this week, investors will want to gauge the impact of inflation on companies' bottom line. While the prospect of weaker economic growth sent stocks lower, inflation fears and the likelihood of central bank policy tightening were reflected in bond markets, where two-year Treasury yields hit 18-month highs, up 35 basis points since the start of October . Ten-year yields rose to a four-month high, undeterred by weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data in recent days as money markets priced interest rates rising from end-2022. ""Markets had bought the message that inflation was transitory and now they are questioning it,"" said Sarah Hewin, senior economist at Standard Chartered. ""We take the view that the current rise in costs is a headwind to activity and as such will limit the growth rebound."" CHINA REAL ESTATE RISKS Asian markets were also under pressure from China's property sector, where the stricken Evergrande group missed a third bond coupon payment in as many weeks and signs are growing of trouble at some other developers. ""For the global economy, the Evergrande affair is detrimental to the economic outlook because it risks slowing down Chinese business activity, which still depends heavily on events in the real estate sector,"" Francois Savary, CIO at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners, said. Chinese economic momentum is clearly slowing; aside from power outages idling some factories and the plunge in car sales, data showed tourism revenues dropped 5% year-on-year during the Oct. 1-7 Golden Week, one of China's busiest travel periods. All those concerns, alongside rising Treasury yields, are keeping alive the bid for the dollar. Its index is a whisker off recent one-year highs  and stands near a three-year peak against the yen . Some analysts fear U.S. data due later this week could increase stagflation fears, if they show the consumer price index above forecast and a drop in retail sales. ""The dollar is the likely near-term winner from these outcomes, with both rates and the risk environment dollar- supportive,"" Standard Chartered predicted.

business,Marketmind: The waiting game," A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. So many question marks these days: will the inflation spike we are witnessing ebb? Will central banks resist temptation to significantly tighten policy? How much of a dampener is $80 oil for the world economy? Are China's property sector problems a sign of a wider malaise? These narratives have kept world stocks seesawing ever since they hit record highs in early-September. Wall Street futures are down half a percent while European shares look set for an even weaker open. Big losses in Asia earlier, with Hong Kong down more than 1%. On bonds, softer growth data is failing to derail a selloff; 10-year Treasury yields are up some 30 basis points in three weeks and on Tuesday, two-year yields touched 18-month highs. The impact of soaring energy prices is showing up in dataprints -- even in Japan, wholesale inflation hit a 13-year high. British shoppers, meanwhile, upped spending by just 0.6% in September versus 3% in August (though fuel shortages peculiar to the UK probably had an outsize impact). Another worrying piece of data is last month's 20% slump in Chinese car sales, which will likely ripple out to global auto shares On the bright side, UK payrolls hit a record high in September, with a 7.2% rise in average weekly earnings in the three months to August. All that comes just before third quarter earnings kick off. Remember several companies have already issued downbeat assessments of how higher prices will have impacted the bottom line. Q3 earnings were never expected to match the Q2 blowout but will they fall short even of the 30% growth expected of U.S. companies? The wait is on. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: -China's Evergrande missed a third round of bond payments -Japan wholesale inflation at 13-year high in September - UK retail spending rose 0.6% in Sept vs 3% increase - IMF issues its updated World Economic Outlook - ECB?�s Chair of the Supervisory Board, Andrea Enria, board members Philip Lane, Frank Elderson, - Bank of Korea holds rates, flags November hike - German ZEW - U.S. JOLTS job openings - U.S. Treasury auctions $96 billion in 3-year and 10-year notes Our Standards: Persistent supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures are constraining the global economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as it cut growth outlooks for the United States and other major industrial powers."

business,"Money markets ramp up global rate hike bets, add pressure on central banks"," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - As inflationary pressures mount worldwide, money markets are charging ahead with pricing aggressive interest rate rises, in most cases betting that policy will be tightened far sooner and at a much faster pace than rate-setters are signalling. Energy prices at multi-year highs and relentless supply chain snarls have raised fears of a future inflation spike, while Norway and New Zealand have become the first developed countries to lift rates as economies recover from the COVID crisis. And hawkish shifts at the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve lead investors to believe rate hikes are around the corner elsewhere too. Accordingly, interest rate futures are rapidly ramping up rate-hike bets; Britain has seen some of the biggest moves with 19 basis points worth of tightening priced for the BOE by end-2021, versus the 2 bps expected a month ago. For the Fed and the European Central Bank, end-2022 rate hikes are 100% and 90% priced respectively, compared to the around 50% and sub-40% seen a week ago. The messages are often in conflict with those from central bankers, who remain adamant that higher inflation is transitory and there is no rush to tighten policy. They also contrast with the view that economic growth is moderating; Goldman Sachs for instance has cut U.S. growth forecasts for 2022. And finally, they are at odds with signals from other market segments; forward inflation swaps for instance still see euro zone prices below 2% in ten years time . Most analysts say market pricing is aggressive, especially so in regions such as the euro zone where policymakers have downplayed inflation risks ""What the market has learned about the Fed or BoE is that they have their guidance but when push comes to shove they go back to the mantra of rate hikes,"" said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""Look at the BoE, Norges Bank, they are all shifting and markets are saying the ECB can't be the odd one out. I tend to think the ECB will be cautious and will try and sit on their hands as much as they can."" While some rate hike expectations have been fuelled by hawkish policymakers, the change in investor perception is eye-catching in other instances. In Australia, markets have ratcheted up expectations of higher interest rates next year by 40 bps even as the Reserve Bank insists it will keep policy super-easy out to 2024. Analysts say the money market moves may heap pressure on central banks, and heighten fears of falling behind the curve. Marija Veitmane, a senior strategist at State Street Global Markets, does not expect aggressive rate hiking cycles in any major economy, but she acknowledged that ""given the conflicting economic cross-currents, central banks around the world are caught between the rock and the hard place right now"".

business,Macron unveils 30-bln euro plan for innovation and industrial revival," PARIS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - France wants to be a leader in green hydrogen by 2030 and build low-carbon planes and small nuclear reactors as part of a 30 billion euro ($35 billion) investment plan, President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday. Macron said the road map, dubbed ""France 2030"", would ensure France decarbonises its industry and brings innovation and production in key areas, from cars and biomedicine to semi-conductors, closer to home by the end of the decade. The long-term plan, outlined six months before the presidential election, was swiftly criticised by the opposition as electoral campaigning, but Macron said those targets were key to ensure France's rank in the world. Pointing to a shortage of face masks when the COVID-19 pandemic first erupted, Macron said the crisis had exposed real vulnerabilities and the crucial need for France to have innovation and industrial production at home. ""We must rebuild the framework for productive independence for France and Europe,"" he said, adding that innovation would be key amid global competition for leadership and access to raw materials. ""The winner takes all,"" he added. Setting out some of the plan's targets, Macron said France would by 2030 build a low-carbon plane, a small modular reactor as well as two megafactories for the production of green hydrogen. It would also produce large numbers of electric vehicles. ""We must wage the battle of innovation and industrialisation at the same time,"" Macron said as he outlined the plan to a group of entrepreneurs, adding: ""We need a country that produces more."" Macron said the plan will give a key role to small, agile start-ups in building France's industrial future alongside well-established corporate giants. CRITICISM Other 2030 objectives include investing in semi-conductors and beefing up innovation in the French health sector, including biomedicine. On top of the 30 billion euros in fresh public investment, some of which will already be included in the 2022 budget, French public investment bank Bpifrance will invest 4 billion euros in startups and innovative firms. This all comes in addition to a 100 billion euro recovery plan announced last year to help France weather the coronavirus pandemic, a large share of which went to promoting greener energy policies. The plan was harshly criticised by the opposition and environmental groups. ""A few months from the end of his mandate, the outgoing president commits French money to restore his electoral image with promises which only bind his successor,"" far-right leader Marine Le Pen said on Twitter. ""It's 'whatever the cost, I want to be re-elected!',"" she said. Matthieu Orphelin, a lawmaker who left Macron's party two years ago said this was Macron's ""first campaign speech for 2022"", while environmental group Greenpeace called it ""a festival of false solutions and wishful thinking"". ""All these false solutions follow the same logic: constantly postpone the real (energy) transition and continue to produce as if the planet's resources were unlimited,"" said Greenpeace France director Jean-François Julliard.

Winter sun destinations such as Egypt, Turkey and the Canary Islands were popular, business travellers were returning to the skies, and easyJet's chief executive said that capacity would keep growing over 2022. ""It is clear recovery is underway,"" CEO Johan Lundgren said on Tuesday. The brighter outlook represents a turnaround from the last year when pandemic uncertainty and travel bans pushed easyJet to an expected headline loss of between 1.135 billion pounds ($1.54 billion)and 1.175 billion pounds for the 12 months to the end of September. The results, due to be confirmed on Nov. 30, will in the best case scenario beat a consensus forecast for a loss of 1.175 billion pounds. Shares in easyJet fell 1.5% to 638 pence by 0900 GMT, which Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said reflected the sense that some investors could be worrying about the broader economic situation for consumers. ""I still believe that the demand picture is there for summer 2022,"" Simpson said. Seeking to boost its finances following the pandemic hit, easyJet in September launched a surprise 1.2 billion pound rights issue and also revealed it had rejected an ""opportunistic"" bid from an unnamed suitor, believed to be rival Wizz Air Lundgren said that while M&A was something that all chief executives look at, easyJet was focused on organic growth. ""On a standalone basis, we've been very confident about where we are,"" he told reporters. Despite the improved outlook, easyJet cautioned that customers were booking closer to their travel date, meaning it could not provide guidance for 2022. It is not recommending a dividend for 2021. EasyJet's exposure to the UK, usually about half of its business with the European Union the other half, hurt it this year as Britain has kept stricter travel rules for longer, putting its recovery slightly behind Europe's biggest airline Ryanair But Britain has recently relaxed those rules, scrapping some tests and its frequently changing traffic light system which deterred bookings. EasyJet said that the recent changes were helping booking momentum.

business,South Korean battery firms to shoulder $1.2 bln of GM's Bolt EV recall costs," SEOUL, Oct 12 (Reuters) - South Korean battery firms LG Chem Ltd GM in August expanded the recall, which will replace LG battery modules due to the risk of fire, to more than 140,000 cars, estimating the cost at $1.8 billion, but that has risen to $2 billion. It previously said battery production resumed on Sept. 20 and replacements would begin in mid-October. As a result of the agreement, GM said its estimated recovery in the third quarter will offset $1.9 billion of the $2 billion in charges associated with the recalls, based on accruals under U.S. accounting standards. GM said LG agreed to cover recall costs and expenses. The final recall costs will depend on the number of battery modules replaced. ?�LG is a valued and respected supplier to GM, and we are pleased to reach this agreement,??said GM global purchasing vice Shilpan Amin, vice president, GM global purchasing and supply chain. GM and LG Energy Solution, the wholly owned battery unit of LG Chem that supplies GM, are building two joint-venture U.S. battery plants. LG Energy Solution said the three companies conducted joint analysis and found two rare defects as the cause of the fires - a torn anode and a folded separator. ""While the recall measures will (proceed) with complete replacement of battery packs and modules made for the early models of batteries, the more recently manufactured battery modules will be selectively replaced following diagnostic software screening,"" LG Energy Solution said in a statement. The LG firms said on Tuesday that talks over the costs had ended. They booked most of their 1.4 trillion won in costs in the July-September quarter although some was booked in the previous quarter. For the latest quarter, LG Chem will take a charge of 620 billion won while LG Electronics, which assembles the cells into battery modules and packs, will book 480 billion won in costs. Shares of LG Chem and LG Electronics closed up 4.2% and 3.3% respectively, with investors relieved there was less uncertainty over the recall costs. GM shares were up 0.6% in premarket U.S.  trading. LG Energy Solution added it plans to resume working on its initial public offering, which had been suspended in August due to the lack of clarity over the recall costs.

business,"Australia's Westpac flags $950 mln profit hit, led by institutional banking"," SYDNEY, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp The country's second-largest lender by market capitalisation said a protracted period of low rates, ""subdued"" financial markets and its exit from energy trading would lead to lower earnings at the unit. The bank gave no further explanation of its exit from energy trading. ""Overall we think it is a setback for management as they look to build credibility with investors,"" said Citigroup banking analyst Brendan Sproules. ""Investors may raise questions around the timing as (interest) rates have been low for some time, and now potentially on the rise."" Australian interest rates have been at record lows since November 2020 but economists expect they will start rising again as soon as next year. Westpac shares were 1.65% lower, after the bank said the A$1.3 billion one-off charge included provisions to pay out customers seeking remediation for wrongly charged fees, and costs associated with the sale of its life insurance unit. The company cut the value of its Westpac Institutional Banking (WIB) unit by nearly A$1 billion after ""reducing risk in the division through the exit of energy trading, consolidating our Asian operations and reducing our correspondent banking relationships which have all impacted earnings"", it said in a securities filing. ""At the same time, medium term expectations of a prolonged low interest rate environment, subdued financial markets income and elevated compliance expenses have impacted WIB's earnings outlook,"" the bank added. Payouts and other costs associated with settling customer lawsuits would add another A$172 million to the one-off charges, while selling costs and tax adjustments linked to the sale of its life insurance unit would add A$267 million to the one-off items. ""It was surprising to see they had more charges related to regulatory issues,"" said Adam Dawes, an investment advisor at Shaw and Partners Ltd. ""We expected Westpac had already accounted for and fixed all those remediation costs."" The bank is scheduled to report annual results on Nov. 1, and was expected to post a cash profit of A$6.5 billion, according to the average forecast of 13 analysts polled by Refinitiv before the charges were announced, nearly triple the previous year's result which was impacted by COVID-19 loan repayment freezes and other macroeconomic shocks.

business,China liberalises coal-fired power pricing to tackle energy crisis," BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it will allow coal-fired power plants to charge some customers market-driven prices for electricity, as a worsening energy crisis persuaded authorities to rush through  their boldest reform of the power sector in decades. Responding to shortfalls in power generation brought on by shortages and record high prices for coal, the government has taken a range of steps to boost coal production and manage  electricity demand at industrial plants. To help power companies pass on the high costs of coal, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said that all electricity generated by coal-fired plants would be priced via market trading ""in an orderly manner"" from Oct. 15. It also instructed commercial and industrial users to buy direct from the market or via agents over the grid ""as soon as possible"". A worsening power crunch has forced production curbs across industries such as cement, steel and aluminium, dampening the outlook for China's economy. Utilities have struggled to keep up with post-pandemic demand for electricity, and power plants generated less as rising price of coal rendered operations uneconomic. Pushing all industrial and commercial users to the power exchanges and allowing prices to be set by the market is expected to encourage loss-making generators to increase output. Addressing a press briefing, NDRC official Peng Shaozong said the reform was ""designed to reflect power demand and consumption, and to some extent to ease operation difficulties of power firms and encourage plants to increase power supply."" The most-active China thermal coal futures contract  soared 11% to a record high 1,507.8 yuan ($233.55) a tonne on Tuesday. ""The relaxation of thermal power pricing is a positive for growth by reducing power outages,"" Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economic Research at HSBC told Reuters. ""However, this comes with a further rise in price pressures, as power companies can now pass on higher input costs to their commercial and industrial customers."" About 44% of China's industrial and commercial firms are currently trading in power markets, buying electricity over exchanges in cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou, while other such customers buy electricity at fixed prices direct from the state-owned grid companies. China's State Council on Friday said it would allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20% from base levels, an increase on previous limits. In 2019, China had allowed coal-fired power prices to rise by 10% and fall by 15% from base levels. The NDRC said that prices for high-energy consumption firms would not be bound by the 20% upper limit, in order to persuade them to consume electricity more efficiently. Lara Dong, senior director of IHS Markit said, ""power prices at 20% above coal-fired power benchmark will not be sufficient to help coal plants breakeven at current fuel prices. And she warned that energy-intensive sectors will face record high power prices. Industries that consume the most electricity include aluminium, steel, ferro-alloys, paper making, cement and textiles. The NDRC said residential and agricultural users, as well as public welfare initiatives, would continue to be charged fixed prices, which are often set too low to cover utilities' costs. Local governments were encouraged to help small- and medium-sized and individual business users cover the increased cost of electricity. INFLATIONARY PRESSURES While the reforms could push up the producer price index (PPI), Peng said, it would help ensure electricity supplies and stabilise production at industrial firms. He said the reform would not have an impact on consumer prices. But analysts and economists warned there were inflationary risks for the world's second largest economy. ""Higher electricity price in China will add to the worry of rising global inflation,"" Kevin Xie, senior Asia economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said. He estimated that a 5-10% hike to electricity prices in China will increase consumer inflation by 0.2 to 0.5 percentage points. Analysts at Nomura expect the new power pricing scheme to impact CPI by close to 0.4 percentage points. Analysts and traders have been forecasting a 12% cut in industrial power consumption in the fourth quarter due to shortages of coal over the winter. Despite local governments in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia ordering some 200 mines to boost output, incessant rain flooded 60 mines in Shanxi. As of Tuesday, four mines with a combined annual output capacity of 4.8 million tonnes remained shut, a Shanxi official told a press conference.

business,Oil holds near $84 on energy crunch fears," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Oil held near $84 a barrel on Tuesday, within sight of a three-year high, supported by a rebound in global demand that is contributing to energy shortages in big economies such as China. With demand growing as economies recover from pandemic lows, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers, collectively known as OPEC+, are sticking to plans to restore output gradually rather than boost supply quickly. ""OPEC+ will push ahead with its cautious approach to supply in the year-end period. Set against this backdrop, oil bears will remain in hibernation mode,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. Brent crude  was up 1 cent at $83.66 a barrel by 1325 GMT. On Monday it hit $84.60, its highest since October 2018. U.S. oil fell 50 cents, or 0.6%, to $80.02, having hit its highest since late 2014 on Monday at $82.18. Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA, said the lack of significant change in prices on Tuesday could be because the  market looks overbought based on short-term technical indicators such as the relative strength index. ""It would not surprise me in the least if we saw a sharp sell-off of $5 to $8 a barrel at some stage this week,"" he said. The price of Brent has surged by more than 60% this year. As well as OPEC+ supply restraint, the rally has been spurred by record European gas prices, which have encouraged a switch to oil for power generation in some places. European gas at the Dutch TTF hub  on Tuesday stood at a crude oil equivalent of about $169 a barrel, based on the relative value of the same amount of energy from each source, Reuters calculations based on Eikon data showed. Power prices have surged to record highs in recent weeks, driven by energy shortages in Asia, Europe and the United States. The energy crisis affecting China is expected to last through to the end of the year. With prices rising, OPEC+ has come under pressure from consumer nations.

business,Rising U.S. yields push yen to lowest in nearly 3 years," LONDON, Oct 12  (Reuters) - The Japanese yen held near its weakest levels versus the U.S. dollar in almost three years on Tuesday as a relentless rise in Treasury yields widened the yield advantage in favour of the greenback. The dollar was at 113.19 yen at 0809 GMT having touched 113.50 in Asian trading, its weakest since December 2018. The yen's recent weakness -- falling 4% in three weeks -- comes at a time when global bond yields have surged due to inflationary concerns. Ten-year U.S. yields topped 1.60% for the first time since late May. ""The pick-up in market-based measures of inflation expectations and the hawkish shifts from central banks outside of Japan are contributing to the sell-offs in global fixed  income markets and the yen,"" MUFG strategists said in a note, noting the yen has the strongest correlation with U.S. yields. A Deutsche Bank monthly market sentiment survey in October noted that an overwhelming majority of respondents expect U.S. Treasury yields to rise from current levels. The yen also stayed in sight of a multi-month lows against other majors with sterling , the euro  and the Aussie dollar  all trading just off three month highs hit against the Japanese currency the previous day, when the Aussie enjoyed its best session against the yen in eleven months.

business,Music streamers turn to telcos to make Africa pay," JOHANNESBURG/STOCKHOLM, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Africa, with its internationally recognised musical talent - and growing mobile phone use - is central to Swedish music streamer Spotify's As African artists such as Nigeria's Burna Boy and South Africa's Black Coffee are streamed across the world, the continent was seen as an obvious choice and is the home to more than a third of the company's 85 new markets. The problem is payment on a continent where many people are more likely to have a mobile phone than a bank account. That means Spotify's first task as it implements a plan announced in February to almost double its footprint is to win over the telecom companies that often equate to banks. Phiona Okumu, Spotify's head of music for Sub-Saharan Africa, told Reuters the company secured ""alternative payment methods"", namely M-Pesa, when it moved into Kenya in February. Owned by Kenya's biggest telecoms operator, Safaricom ""A lot of African countries are unbanked so that means they don't use credit cards and this is very true for a lot of east African (countries) and in Kenya you use M-Pesa for the most part,"" Okumu said. Elsewhere in Africa, Spotify is seeking other collaborators. ""We are having conversations with the right partners to ensure that we are providing solutions to payment problems that several African consumers face in different parts of the continent,"" Okumu said. CHASING THE MOBILE MONEY Irene Kophen, a Spotify premium user based in Kenya, said she prefers M-Pesa rather than bank cards because she thinks mobile money has made music more accessible. ""Most of us have access to our phones, but not many of us have cards, or bank accounts,"" the 31-year-old told Reuters. Costs associated with opening bank accounts, the distance to financial institutions and the difficulty in meeting ""Know Your Customers"" requirements because of inadequate proof of ""The past few years have seen an emphasis on shifting towards expansion of innovative banking services through mobile technology to capture lower income segments and the unbanked,"" a spokesperson for South Africa's Absa bank By 2020, sub-Saharan Africa had 548 million mobile money accounts, up 12% from 2019 - more than any other region in the world, mobile industry body GSMA said.

The collaboration can benefit both sides by boosting revenue and helping to increase subscribers, but for the streaming companies it is all-but essential. ""It is critical that streaming companies get this right, otherwise they will lose out on revenue from consumers who were willing, but unable, to pay them,"" Charles Stuart, PwC partner and director of Technology, Media and Telecommunications, said. For the telecom companies, which also include Airtel Nigeria MTN ""We're talking to players who are music-only players and also we're talking to players who have broader reach in music, video and gaming and who can position our digital services much better,"" MTN's Dioum said.

business,"U.S. earnings seen strong, but supply chains and costs worry investors"," NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Investors are primed for another period of strong U.S. profit growth as third-quarter reports from Corporate America flow in starting this week. But as business continues to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, new problems are arising that are taking center stage for Wall Street, including supply-chain snags and inflationary pressures. In the run-up to earnings season, a number of companies have issued downbeat outlooks. FedEx Corp ""The pace of growth is decelerating, but still it's at a meaningful level,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. With the product and labor shortages and inflationary pressures, ""we'll be looking to see to what extent demand is there, and what does it mean for the important holiday spending period."" Analysts see a 29.6% year-over-year increase in earnings for S&P 500 companies in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday, down from 96.3% growth in the second quarter. The third-quarter forecast is down a touch from several weeks ago, a reversal of the recent trend for estimates. Third-quarter earnings growth was always expected to be much lower than the blowout gain of the second quarter, when companies had much easier year-ago comparisons because of the pandemic. ""We were going up at such a high clip. The positive revision momentum has lapsed,"" said Nick Raich, CEO of independent research firm The Earnings Scout. Earnings season is kicking off this week with the big banks including JPMorgan Chase SUPPLY CHAINS, COSTS Investors are weighing the impact of sharply higher energy costs on businesses and consumers after a recent surge in oil and natural gas prices. While higher energy prices should be a boon for energy producers, they are an inflationary risk for many other companies like airlines and other industrials and cut into consumer spending. U.S. companies have so far this year kept profit margins at record levels because they have cut costs and passed along high prices to customers. Some investors are anxious to see how long that can go on. Third-quarter earnings arrive with the market still wobbly after a weak and volatile September. The S&P 500 Analysts are skeptical about how much is priced in. ""COVID-related supply chain issues have spread beyond consumer goods. And longer-term signs of global friction are easy to find,"" Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy at BofA Securities, and other BofA strategists wrote in a note on Friday. These issues are far from being fully priced into stocks, they wrote. Also, while supply chain issues have grabbed investor attention, wage inflation is ""just as big of a headwind (if not bigger,"" BofA strategists wrote in a note Monday. Guidance from companies ""could be ugly,"" they added. Morgan Stanley's analysts say that consensus earnings expectations also have not fully priced in the supply-chain constraints facing companies, making it much harder for companies to surpass estimates at the same rate as in recent quarters. ""Consumer Discretionary companies of all kinds are right in the cross hairs of the supply shortages, higher logistics costs and higher labor costs,"" they wrote. Those strategists see the equity market set for a bigger pullback, and say third-quarter earnings could determine how deeply the stock market dips.

business,World Bank taking steps to boost research integrity after data rigging scandal," WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The World Bank is taking steps to rebuild the credibility of its research after a data-rigging scandal forced it to cancel  its flagship ""Doing Business"" report on country business climates, bank President David Malpass said on Monday. Speaking to reporters ahead of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings this week, Malpass said strong research products remain a high priority for the bank and it would work on new ways to help countries improve their business climates. Asked how the bank would rebuild its credibility after the scandal, Malpass the bank had taken ""several steps"" to improve research integrity, including elevating chief economist Carmen Reinhart to a role in senior management. Malpass declined to answer questions on the IMF executive board's review of a World Bank The IMF board was to deliberate again on Monday over whether she should continue as the IMF's leader. The same investigation report by law firm WilmerHale found that World Bank staff altered data to boost Saudi Arabia's ""Doing Business"" ranking in October 2019 - six months after Malpass took over the bank's top job - but it did not find evidence of involvement by the bank's Office of the President or board members. Malpass did not detail other steps that the bank was taking to shore up its research function, but said that Reinhart would be a senior president and among the top 10 executives of the World Bank Group that guide policy and decision-making at the Multilateral Development lender. ""I want really to reinforce the importance of top-quality research and the bank's ability to produce that research in high volumes,"" Malpass said.

business,U.S. IPO boom braves market volatility," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Weeks of stock market volatility have done little to dent the record-setting pace of U.S. initial public offerings, with capital market insiders forecasting a strong finish to the year and a robust pipeline of listings in 2022. More than 2,000 IPOs raised a combined $421 billion globally by the end of September, a record high, as private companies rushed to attain the soaring valuations of their publicly listed peers. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data. Four IPOs were withdrawn or postponed in the United States in the last three weeks, according to Dealogic. Uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling, the financial woes of Chinese property developer Evergrande and spiraling energy prices and inflation fueled wild swings in the stock market, making it more difficult for companies to price their stock market debuts. Still, U.S. IPOs proved more resilient than those in Europe, where seven listings were pulled. With U.S. lawmakers agreeing last week to postpone the debt ceiling issue for two months and investors coming to grips with the Chinese property market's jitters, IPO bankers and lawyers said most companies were keeping their listing plans on track. ""We see not only new deals coming to the market, we see existing engagements continuing to move forward,"" said Marc Jaffe, managing partner of law firm Latham & Watkins' New York office. In the last three weeks, IFIT Health & Fitness Inc IPO hopefuls that braved the market volatility were rewarded by investors, albeit less than they previously expected. Shares of U.S. companies that went public in the last four weeks have gone up 25.5% on average, compared with a 42% rise in value for those that went public this time about four months ago, according to Dealogic. Jim Cooney, head of Americas equity capital markets at Bank of America Corp ""Investors have narrowed the scope of investments to consider given overall muted performance in the secondary market,"" Cooney said. Among the biggest high-profile IPOs expected by the end of the year are those of electric vehicle market Rivian Automotive and chipmaker GlobalFoundries.  More are expected soon, industry insiders said.

Yellen said in the statement that ""proactive steps must be taken to reinforce data integrity and credibility at the IMF,"" and Georgieva and other Fund leaders must renew their commitment to upholding transparency in research, analysis and policies. The call came after the IMF executive board on Monday reaffirmed its full confidence in Georgieva's leadership of the Fund after a lengthy review of a World Bank external The report by law firm WilmerHale alleged that when Georgieva was World Bank CEO in 2017, she pressured bank staff to alter data to boost China's score in the flagship ""Doing Business"" report.

business,"Jet set scramble as skyrocketing demand for private planes drives delays, cancellations"," LAS VEGAS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Private business jets once provided refuge from airport waiting lines for the few that could afford them, but the fading pandemic has driven demand to such heights that even wealthy travelers now face cancellations and delays. While a headache for some jet set travelers, the crunch is a boon for makers of corporate planes built to carry 19 or less passengers in luxury, with announcements for new orders expected at the world's largest business jet show that starts Tuesday. Some fractional ownership and charter plane operators are turning away business, face a further crunch as the holiday season looms - and are buying more planes. Traffic has surged above 2019 levels in the United States. Combined with staffing shortages, the situation is squeezing industry services from fueling to catering, while fewer spare planes are available to replace jets that break down, executives said. To protect service, NetJets Inc recently suspended sales of jet cards, which allow customers to pre-pay for blocks of flight hours. The world's largest private jet company said it is investing approximately $2.5 billion for 100 new aircraft to be delivered between now and the end of 2022. ""The vast number of flights is taxing the air travel infrastructure in ways we haven?�t seen in years,"" said Ohio-based NetJets. It saw about 10 times more flights delayed due to air traffic control in June 2021, compared with June 2020 when flights dived during the pandemic. Flight demand is ""currently exceeding all other highs"" in its 57 years, with an average of around 500 flights a day compared to under 400 a day in 2019, it said in a statement. ""While most owners have experienced business as usual in their recent travels, a few have felt the challenges that coincide with heightened demand across the industry,"" it said. Fly Exclusive, which provides jets to charter operators in a kind of wholesale business, is seeing a significant increase in requests since their clients are increasingly running short of aircraft. Investors closely watch the dynamic in the private jet market as operators are key customers for corporate planemakers. The delays are creating complaints among affluent travelers who are already looking for alternatives. Amanda Applegate, a partner at aviation law firm Aerlex Law Group said she received 10 calls last month alone from clients who were unhappy with their service. ""In good times I don?�t get any calls or at most one or two every six months or so,"" said Applegate, who works on deals to buy and sell planes and is an information hub for her clients. Applegate said she isn't quite sure what to tell private jet clients who are looking for the best service. ""There's just not enough capacity."" Ian Moore, chief commercial officer at private jet company VistaJet, said there is less tolerance in the industry for customers who cancel or put off flights at the last minute without penalty because they get stuck at in a meeting. Now, the planes don't wait. ""There's just not enough supply for that anymore,"" Moore said.

business,"Japan wholesale inflation hits 13-year high, squeezing corporate profits"," TOKYO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale inflation hit a 13-year high in September as rising global commodity prices and a weak yen pushed up import costs, putting pressure on corporate margins and raising the risk of unwanted consumer price hikes. Rising input costs are adding strain for manufacturers already hit by supply constraints and clouding the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, which relies on exports to cushion the blow from soft consumption, analysts say. The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, surged 6.3% in September from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Tuesday, exceeding market forecasts for a 5.9% gain. The increase accelerated from a revised 5.8% rise in August to its fastest pace since September 2008, the data showed. ""If rises in raw material costs accelerate, companies selling final goods prices will see profits squeezed. As Japan is a net importer of fuel, such cost-push inflation could hurt the economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities. Rising oil prices pushed up petroleum and coal costs by 32.4% in September, while prices of wood products spiked 48.3%. An index gauging yen-based wholesale import prices surged a record 31.3% in September from a year earlier, suggesting a weak yen - usually a boon to the economy by lifting exports - could hurt growth by squeezing the bottom line for corporations. ""A double whammy of declining yen value and rising energy costs could be a huge blow to Japan's economy,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities. Still, analysts doubted whether the rise in wholesale prices would trigger a spike in Japan's consumer inflation, as seen in other economies. ""Most of the rise in wholesale prices will be absorbed by companies with the impact on consumers likely marginal, such as through higher gasoline costs,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute. Core consumer inflation was flat in August from the previous year, well short of the BOJ's 2% target, as weak household spending keeps firms from raising prices.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal Weary investors had been holding out little hope that Evergrande would suddenly stump up Monday's near $150 million of coupon payments, but the fact bondholders said they hadn't received anything this time either just bolstered expectations for a full-scale default. ""The key for offshore holders is the next couple of weeks and whether any payment or communication will come from the company in relation to its first missed offshore coupon,"" wrote Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst, UK & EMEA, at forex trading firm Erlam wrote that it was ""highly unlikely"" Evergrande would make the payment ""considering how the last two deadlines have gone"".

Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers' cash flow hard,"" he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes.

Trevelyan, who took up the post last month in a ministerial reshuffle, will pick up where her predecessor Liz Truss left off: arguing for a level playing field on international trade as Britain seeks to carve out a new post-Brexit role for itself. ""We cannot, and will not, allow British businesses who play by the rules to be damaged and undercut by market-distorting practices from other countries,"" she said in a statement ahead of a G20 trade ministers' meeting in Italy. ""Today's meeting is a great opportunity to rally our G20 partners and build alliances that can defend the global trading system and help bring it into the 21st century.""

business,Coordinated action needed to halt spread of fragile states -IMF chief," WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Coordinated action is needed to arrest and begin to reverse the expanding numbers of fragile states, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Monday. Georgieva told a panel at the fall meetings of the IMF and World Bank the COVID-19 pandemic had exacerbated problems in states that were already more vulnerable to problems such as extreme poverty, droughts, rising food prices and, in some cases, war. ""We have to have the humbleness to recognize that the universe of fragile states has been expanding, and unless we commit to bring all our forces together, we will not arrest or reverse that trend,"" she said. Georgieva said economic trends were diverging for advanced economies and all developing countries, but the gap was far more stark for fragile and conflicted-affected states, which saw real gross domestic product per capita decline by 6.6% in 2020. These countries also saw a bigger increase in public debt and were expected to face more inflationary pressures, but had a hard time raising revenues. Support from the international community was critical to help fragile states and reverse the growing divergence, she said, noting that the IMF had provided $7.5 billion to support to support fragile states. The IMF's recent allocation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights included $16.2 billion in funds for these countries, she said.

business,"Yen slumps as rising energy prices, U.S. yields bite"," HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The yen hit a fresh three-year low on Tuesday, extending a sharp slide as traders wagered surging energy prices would drive Japan's demand for dollars and as they doubled down on expectations U.S. rates will rise well ahead of its peers. The yen , nursing losses after its worst session against the dollar in five months, edged another 0.1% lower to 113.48 per dollar in early Asia trade, its weakest since December 2018, having shed 1% on Monday. The Japanese currency's woes helped the dollar stay firm against a basket of major peers, even though the Aussie dollar has been gaining on surging energy prices and a bounce in iron ore. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was at 94.4 , not far from its one-year high of 94.504 touched at the end of September. ""What we're seeing in currency markets is a combination of the outlook for the Federal Reserve - largely markets are expecting a tapering announcement in November - and what is happening with commodities with a pretty broad rally at the moment,"" said Kim Mundy, currency strategist and senior economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. She said these factors were affecting the yen, because Japan is a net energy importer ""and so spiking energy prices are effectively a tax on consumption"" and because it ""reiterates the fact that Bank of Japan will probably be one of the last major central banks to even consider reducing ultra accommodative monetary policy."" Japan's wholesale prices surged 6.3% in September from a year earlier as raw material costs continued to rise, data published Tuesday showed. The yen is also sensitive to rising U.S. yields, since rates at home are anchored near zero. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields  extended gains on Tuesday and, at 1.6136%, are their highest since June and up 30 bps in three weeks. On Monday, U.S. crude touched $82.18 a barrel, its highest since late 2014, and Brent crude hit a three year high. With other commodity prices also robust the Aussie dollar  stayed firm at $0.7342, a day after hitting a month high. The inflationary impact of rising energy prices has solidified the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce a tapering of its massive bond buying programme in November, raising the possibility of interest rate hikes in late 2022, even though jobs data published last Friday missed expectations. Price concerns are also on the minds of policy makers at other central banks, with the Bank of England hinting it will raise interest rates to curb inflation, supporting sterling even as the British economy grapples with high energy costs.

business,Concrete industry says carbon capture a key to hitting emissions targets," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Global cement and concrete makers on Tuesday laid out steps to cut carbon dioxide emissions 25% by 2030 and to reach zero net emissions by mid-century, relying on more carbon-free energy, new chemistry and manufacturing technology, and carbon capture. Cement, the glue of concrete, accounts for about 7% of global carbon emissions, and the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) accounts for 80% of concrete made outside of China, and some companies within China. The United Nations COP26 climate conference next month is spurring many companies to make emissions pledges. The GCCA plan to meet the previously announced goal of net zero emissions by 2050 did not lay out costs or break down how much each step would cut in emissions. The plan includes finding and substituting more alternatives to clinker, a binder of cement, more use of alternative fuels, new chemistry and manufacturing processes, carbon capture and storage, increased efficiency in concrete use and pushing governments to approve new forms of concrete and buy them. In an interview with Reuters ahead of the announcement, GCCA Chief Executive Thomas Guillot said 10 industrial-scale carbon-capture plants pledged in its roadmap by 2030 would be built and paid for by members. Industry experts have cited major hurdles around getting widely unavailable carbon-capture technology up to speed by 2050, including regulatory issues, safety concerns, cost and public acceptance. Guillot acknowledged the barriers but said members were having conversations with governments and regulators, while the GCCA had taken the matter up with international bodies. Those conversations also included carbon pricing. ""In 10 years, we need to prove not only the technical feasibility, but also the economic feasibility"" of carbon capture, Guillot said. ""We are confident this will work."" Jeffrey Rissman, Industry Program Director at California-based Energy Innovation, said the blueprint from the GCCA was ""surprisingly comprehensive,"" praising plans for clinker substitution and use of alternative fuels. But he warned that burning plastic waste as an energy source would not prevent CO2 from getting into the atmosphere. Mexico's CEMEX, a GCCA member and North America's biggest concrete producer, said it was seeking government support for its carbon capture programs.

The city's unofficial motto - ""Keep Austin Weird"" - has given rise to a quirky, bohemian cultural scene that has turned local music festivals like Austin City Limits and South by Southwest into national attractions. ""It will be hard to keep that up when Austin becomes bigger and bigger,"" said Ryan Baker, 32, who works at a restaurant in East Austin. Austin Mayor Steve Adler welcomed Tesla's decision and said the company fits right in with Austin's strong innovative, entrepreneurial and environmentally focused culture. His office did not respond to questions about housing affordability. Austin's rapid growth is also expected to exacerbate the city's congestion problems, with three out of four residents driving to work alone in their car. While Austin is working to improve its public transit network, Tesla's factory is located in a transit desert. The city may evaluate transit options to the plant, but it expects most of Tesla's workers to drive to the plant, Austin Transportation Director Rob Spillar said. Austin hopes an increase in housing, stores and medical clinics will attract workers to live close to the plant, Spillar said. Roberts Communities, a developer for affordable manufactured housing, is hoping to benefit. The company has bought large plots of land just minutes from the Tesla factory and sells houses at around $80,000. Tesla factory workers will receive an average annual salary of $47,000, an income considered low by Travis County's health and human services division. ""All those workers will want to live somewhere nice, clean and affordable with their families,"" said Brandon Long, a Roberts Communities sales manager at the local Oak Ranch site.

business,Elliott urges REIT Healthcare Trust of America to explore sale," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Investment Management on Monday urged Healthcare Trust of America Elliott, which is one of HTA's largest investors, said the company's longstanding underperformance compared to its peers has stoked frustration and shareholders want it to aim for a sale. HTA shares were up 2.1% at $32.38 in afternoon trading. The news comes months after HTA Chief Executive Officer Scott Peters stepped down, which Elliot termed as ""abrupt and unexpected"". ""HTA faces a challenging stand-alone future given a disadvantaged ability to compete for acquisition targets, the inherently risky task of having to identify and integrate a new CEO and the difficult mission of repairing and rebuilding the company's culture,"" Elliott said in a letter to HTA's board. HTA, which invests in real estate primarily consisting of medical office buildings, is presently headed by interim CEO Peter N. Foss. Investors believe that HTA should conduct the review, including solicitation of bids, before it makes a decision regarding its new CEO, Elliott said, cautioning the absence of such a review would make it difficult to attract a suitable candidate for the position. Elliott said it was confident that ""highly credible buyers"" would make offers at a substantial premium to the HTA stock's current trading price. In response to the hedge fund's letter, HTA said it had held several discussions with Elliott representatives after it was first contacted by the firm and shared the information with its full board.

business,U.S. considers faster hog slaughtering based on plant staffing -union," CHICAGO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is considering a proposal that could allow some pork plants to slaughter pigs more quickly if they boost staffing, a union official said, after a U.S. court struck down a Trump-era rule that removed line speed limits. The proposal put forward by Quality Pork Processors, operator of a large Minnesota slaughterhouse, and union officials could benefit companies like WH Group Ltd's Faster slaughtering would help them increase pork production at a time of high demand and soaring bacon prices. Seven pork plants were initially able to operate without limits on line speeds after a 2019 U.S. Department of Agriculture rule change that did not need congressional approval. Six of the plants had previously received waivers to run at a faster pace. A federal judge in March invalidated the policy and forced the plants to slow down following a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union lawsuit against the USDA over concerns about worker safety. The second-biggest U.S. pig producer, Seaboard Foods Under the new proposal, Quality Pork Processors would be able to speed up again if the USDA and unions agree staffing levels are high enough, said Richard Morgan, president of the UFCW local that represents the plant's workers. He said staffing levels could be monitored daily. ""The number of staffing would dictate what the line speed can be that day,"" he said. ""It's all about the staffing."" USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said last week the USDA was considering Quality Pork Processors' proposal and that it could create the structure for waivers for five other facilities. He did not give details but seemed to refer to the facilities with waivers prior to the 2019 rule. ""I?�m happy that they are tying the line speeds to worker safety, but this is all backroom dealings and does not appear to take into consideration food safety whatsoever,"" said Zach Corrigan, senior staff attorney for Food & Water Watch. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The USDA did not respond to subsequent questions , nor did Quality Pork Processors respond to requests for comment. Workers at the company's plant would have more time off and be able to meet production goals more quickly if line speeds and staffing levels increase again, Morgan said. He noted that the workers, who are paid hourly, have been working six days per week to meet production targets. The plant's maximum slaughtering capacity dropped by about 7% to 17,700 pigs per week after the court decision took effect, said Steve Meyer, economist for consultancy Partners for Production Agriculture. Nationally, the pork industry has lost 2.5% of its slaughtering capacity, the National Pork Producers Council said."
business,"Ukrainian bank chief dismissed, put under house arrest after scuffle with journalists"," KYIV, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine's third-largest bank dismissed its chairman on Monday  after a Kyiv court ordered him to be put under house arrest while police investigate a scuffle with journalists in his office. Last week, police and prosecutors launched an investigation after the news outlet Radio Liberty said staff at the state-run Ukreximbank attacked a team of its journalists who were investigating the bank's lending practices. Ukreximbank's supervisory board suspended its chairman, Yevgen Metsger, and apologised to the journalists after Radio Liberty aired footage and audio of the incident. Metsger has said he would resign if police found him guilty of a crime. On Monday a court ordered Metsger to remain under house arrest between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. every night, the Kyiv city prosecutor's office said in a statement. ""Two persons, the head of the bank and the official in charge of information policy. have been placed under night house arrest,"" it said. Metsger could not immediately be reached for comment but he has previously apologised for what he described as an ""overly emotional reaction and unrestrained behaviour towards the journalists"". The bank's supervisory board issued a statement on Monday evening saying Metsger himself had formally initiated the ""termination of fixed-term employment contract on his own initiative"" and was subsequently dismissed. The bank said it had appointed an interim chairman until a permanent replacement was found by next April at the latest. Radio Liberty said reporters from its programme ""Schemes"" are investigating a loan made by the bank. The bank has denied any wrongdoing over loans and said banking secrecy laws prevented it from discussing the matter. Radio Liberty said it had managed to restore footage of the confrontation with Metsger despite the bank's attempt to delete it.

business,Stellantis to rationalise plants in Turin in Italian operation overhaul," MILAN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Stellantis Stellantis will assign Mirafiori a new electrified platform to build Maserati sedans between 2022 and 2024, making Turin, where it already produces the electric 500, the group's hotspot for electrification in Italy. Future production of the electric 500 is also confirmed in Turin, Stellantis added in a statement, after presenting the plan in Rome to the industry and labour ministers and unions. All 1,100 workers and functions in Grugliasco will move to Mirafiori by 2024 with no overall impact on jobs in the area, the group said without giving details about what happens to the Grugliasco site after that date. Assembly operations will move immediately. Grugliasco, where Stellantis makes some Maserati models, is just four km from Mirafiori. Its workers have often moved between the two sites based on production needs. The plan marks a new step in Stellantis' effort to overhaul its production in Italy, which has been under scrutiny for costing more than elsewhere in Europe since the group was formed at the beginning of this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA. In June, Stellantis decided to base production at Melfi, its largest facility in the country, on a single enhanced line that will merge two existing ones with unchanged capacity. It will build four medium-segment electric vehicles, of different brands, from 2024. It also said in July it would build one of its three European battery factories in Italy, at the Termoli site, which currently makes internal combustion engines.

business,Poor countries' debt rose 12% to record $860 bln in 2020- World Bank," WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The World Bank on Monday warned of a significant 12% rise in the debt burden of the world's low-income countries to a record $860 billion in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and called for urgent efforts to reduce debt levels. World Bank President David Malpass told reporters the bank's International Debt Statistics 2022 report showed a dramatic increase in the debt vulnerabilities facing low- and middle-income countries; he also urged for comprehensive efforts to help countries reach more sustainable debt levels. ""We need a comprehensive approach to the debt problem, including debt reduction, swifter restructuring and improved transparency,"" Malpass said in a statement accompanying the new report. He said half of the world's poorest countries were in external debt distress or at high risk of it. Malpass said sustainable debt levels were needed to help countries achieve economic recovery and reduce poverty. The report said the external debt stocks of low- and middle-income countries combined rose 5.3% in 2020 to $8.7 trillion, affecting countries in all regions. It said the rise in external debt outpaced gross national income (GNI) and export growth, with the external debt-to-GNI ratio, excluding China, rising five percentage points to 42% in 2020, while their debt-to-export ratio surged to 154% in 2020 from 126% in 2019. Malpass said debt restructuring efforts were urgently needed given the expiration at the end of this year of the Group of 20 major economies' Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which has offered temporary deferral of debt payments. The G20 and Paris Club of official creditors launched a Common Framework for Debt Treatments last year to restructure unsustainable debt situations and protracted financing gaps in DSSI-eligible countries, but only three countries - Ethiopia, Chad and Zambia - have applied thus far. Malpass said further debt payment freezes could be included  as part of Common Framework debt restructurings, but more work was also needed to increase the participation of private sector creditors, who have thus far been reluctant to get involved. The report showed that net inflows from multilateral creditors to low- and middle-income countries rose to $117 billion in 2020, the highest level in a decade. Net lending to low-income countries rose 25% to $71 billion, also the highest level in a decade, with the IMF and other multilateral creditors providing $42 billion and bilateral creditors $10 billion, it said. Carmen Reinhart, the World Bank's chief economist, said the challenges facing highly indebted countries could get worse as interest rates rose. The World Bank said it expanded the 2022 report to boost transparency about global debt levels by providing more detailed and disaggregated data on external debt. The data now include a breakdown of a borrowing country?�s external debt stock to show the amount owed to each official and private creditor, the currency composition of this debt, and the terms on which loans were extended. For DSSI-eligible countries the data also show the debt service deferred in 2020 by each bilateral creditor and the projected month-by-month debt-service payments owed to them through 2021.

business,GSK to cement split with two new headquarters," Oct 11 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline GSK is due to be split in two in the middle of next year in its biggest shake-up in two decades with the consumer healthcare arm, a joint venture with Pfizer Headquarters for the new business, including research facilities, will be built in Weybridge, southwest of London, to house 1,400 staff from the end of 2024. However, staff will first relocate from GSK's current corporate headquarters in Brentford, west London, to temporary facilities in Weybridge when the split takes place in mid-2022. Weybridge is already home to a GSK oral health research and development (R&D) site and Procter & Gamble The rest of GSK's Brentford staff, working for the pharmaceuticals and vaccines business, will move to an as-yet-undetermined site in the same area at the end of 2023 or later, with the pharma giant saying it would be ""maintaining access to the UK?�s world-leading science and innovation hubs"". GSK said it planned to provide further updates on that location in mid-2022.

business,Column: Hedge funds' dollar policy: longer for longer: McGeever," ORLANDO, Fla., Oct 11 (Reuters) - The dollar is at a crossroads after a 5% rally in four months, as many investors assess how much of the Fed's bond purchase taper and future rate hikes are priced in, and if any further increase in U.S. yields will be for ""good"" or ""bad"" reasons. Not hedge funds though, who continue to hoover up dollars. If central banks' post-2008 interest rate policy could generally be summed up as 'lower for longer', speculators' stance on the dollar now appears to be 'longer for longer'. The latest positioning data from U.S. futures markets show hedge funds and other speculators significantly added to their net long dollar position against a range of global currencies in the week to October 5 for a 12th straight week. The total net long position now stands at $22.5 billion, the largest since June 2019, while the $7.2 billion increase from the previous week was the third largest in more than three years. The dollar bullishness could not be more broad-based. Funds flipped to a net short euro position for the first time since March last year, turned net short sterling for the first time in a month, threw in the towel on their long Brazilian real position, and now hold their biggest net short Mexican peso bet in four and a half years Clearly, the rise in U.S. bond yields - in nominal, real and relative terms - is all the speculative FX trading community needs to see. Hedge fund industry data provider HFR said its benchmark currency index rose 1% in September. That may not be anywhere near the commodity index's stunning 5.2% surge, but it was its best month since March last year. Last week, the 10-year U.S. yield rose 15 basis points, the most since February, and is now above 1.60% for the first time since June. The dollar has risen against a basket of currencies for five weeks, and is hovering close to a one-year high. The question now is, are the factors driving up U.S. bond yields supportive of further dollar appreciation, or not? The recent increase in Treasury yields has been driven by rising inflation pressures fueled by supply chain shocks, shortages, and sky-high energy prices. Breakeven inflation rates have popped higher across the curve and are now close to scaling the year's peaks reached in May. All this while the medium-term U.S. growth outlook, as evidenced by the latest non-farm payroll disappointment, has dimmed. In short, a kind of 'stagflation' scenario. Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pandl and his team argue that this is generally a constructive environment for the dollar, whose performance ""tends to differ depending on whether higher inflation reflects better growth or other factors, such as adverse supply shocks."" But when inflation expectations rise for more benign reasons such as better growth prospects, the dollar tends to depreciate against most currencies. This is what they expect in the coming months as COVID-19 cases fall and economies open up, leading to a ""moderately weaker"" dollar going into the year-end. The urge for many traders who have been on the crest of this dollar wave to simply take profit is also likely to limit the potential for much more upside from here, at least in the short term. But Derek Halpenny and his team at MUFG argue that funds' $22.5 billion net long dollar position is ""not yet excessive"" compared with what was in place pre-pandemic. They have a point. In May 2019, CFTC speculators' net dollar holdings stood at $35 billion. They also argue that Friday's sub-par September employment report will not derail the Fed from its tapering schedule, which should be outlined next month. Momentum and fundamentals both point to a stronger dollar going into the year-end, they reckon.

business,Yellen confident U.S. Congress will pass minimum global corporate tax," WASHINGTON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday she was Yellen said the actions to bring the United States into compliance with the global minimum tax would likely be included in the so-called reconciliation budget bill containing President Joe Biden's proposed spending initiatives. Asked on ABC's ""This Week"" whether she was confident the measure would get through, Yellen said: ""Yes. I am confident that what we need to do to come into compliance with the minimum tax will be included in a reconciliation package. I hope that we, that it will be passed and we will be able to reassure the world that the United States will do its part."" The parliamentary maneuver known as budget reconciliation would allow Democrats to act without Republican votes. A group of 136 countries on Friday set a Treasury officials and tax experts have said that the global minimum tax would not require a treaty to implement and could be achieved in the reconciliation bill because it is a voluntary agreement among countries to individually impose a minimum tax on overseas earnings of corporations. The United States has had such a minimum tax since the end of 2017, so it is a matter of raising the rate to conform with the agreement. Treasury officials have said they regard the global minimum tax as less controversial than a higher overall corporate tax rate or a higher capital gains tax, because it puts the United States on a more competitive footing with other countries. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it will review details of the Biden administration proposals closely. ""We remain especially concerned about the cumulative impact of the (global minimum tax) proposal and the tax changes being sought by the administration as part of the reconciliation bill pending before Congress,??Neil Bradley, the chamber's chief policy officer, said in a statement. Yellen did not address how to implement another part of the deal that aims to revamp taxation for large technology companies and other highly profitable multinational firms. The so-called ""Pillar 1"" part of the tax deal would reallocate taxing rights on companies with more than $20 billion in annual revenue to countries where their products and services are sold for 25% of the profit above a 10% margin. U.S. Senate Republicans have argued that this would require a new international tax treaty that would require ratification with a two-thirds Senate majority. Republican senators told Yellen in a letter they were concerned the Biden administration was considering circumventing the need to obtain the Senate's authority to implement treaties. Under the U.S. Constitution, the Senate must ratify any treaty with a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes. Biden's fellow Democrats control only 50 seats in the 100-member chamber. Republicans in recent years have been overwhelmingly hostile to treaties and have backed cuts in corporate taxes. Yellen told a Senate Banking Committee hearing in late September that the administration was instead considering alternative means to modify existing bilateral tax treaties that would avoid a two-thirds majority vote. Yellen has said she believes that taxing rights reallocation for big multinationals would hold some bipartisan appeal because the deal would replace digital services taxes that have been imposed by some countries on companies including Facebook She has said that Our Standards: KKR & Co Inc said on Monday it has elevated its co-presidents Scott Nuttall and Joseph Bae to co-chief executive officers, succeeding the storied private equity firm's billionaire co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts."

The stake would be offered with a loan financing package already in place, worth about 80% of the price. Banks that financed a $12.4 billion acquisition of the company's oil pipelines earlier this year received a request for proposals from Aramco last week, said three sources familiar with the matter. That deal, which included all of Aramco's existing and future stabilised crude pipelines, was backed by $10.5 billion financing from a large group of banks including Citi, HSBC and JPMorgan. Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new financing for gas pipelines.

Potential buyers are expected to submit bids at the end of October, said one of the sources. Earlier this year Aramco, similar to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), used a lease-back agreement to sell a 49% stake of newly formed Aramco Oil Pipelines Co to the buyer and rights to 25 years of tariff payments for oil carried on its pipelines.

business,Business jet makers look to tap surging travel demand at Las Vegas air show," LAS VEGAS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Planemakers are unveiling new orders and fresh models at the world's largest business jet show this week as they aim to cash in on a boom in private travel, but executives warn of headwinds due to a capacity crunch. The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) show returns to an in-person format starting in Las Vegas on Tuesday, testing the strength of demand for jets following the emergence of COVID-19. The show will also shed light on the resilience of the aerospace supply chain, given strained logistics worldwide. Brazil's Embraer U.S. planemaker Textron Aviation Easing travel restrictions and the lure of private flights have led to an unexpected surge in business aviation, with traffic rising from 2019 levels. That is filling seats for private operators and expanding order backlogs for planemakers, straining the supply of jets, parts and pilots. Craig Ross, head of California-based Aviation Portfolio, an  adviser to business jet clients, said he is seeing cases of flights getting canceled because of a lack of pilots and delays from a shortage of plane parts for maintenance. That is occurring in an industry that charges top prices for reliability, with some private operators turning down business to protect service. ""Everyone will be talking about the same thing: 'How do we deal with this demand,'"" said Ian Moore, chief commercial officer of private jet company VistaJet. ""I'm sure that's going to be a topic at every booth and every cocktail party in Vegas this year."" One top supplier, Honeywell International Inc General Dynamics Corp's It is a boon for private aviation, which has yet to rebound  to the 1,300 aircraft delivered in 2008 before the financial crash, said aviation analyst Brian Foley in a recent note. Foley said he expects around 700 business aircraft deliveries in 2021, with a ramp-up in production expected to begin in 2022 as planemakers gain confidence the surge is sustainable. While Cessna business jet maker Textron Aviation is raising production to meet demand despite supply-chain challenges, Canada's Bombardier is waiting to see how orders evolve.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average The pan-European STOXX 600 index Heading into Tuesday, the mood in Asia could also be hit by news that Chinese property developer Evergrande Oil prices, which had jumped on Monday on rebounding demand and cutbacks in supply, gave up some of their early gains but still ended the session higher. Brent crude  rose 1.5% to $83.65 a barrel, after climbing as high as $84.60, its highest since October 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude  also added 1.5% to finish at $80.52, after touching its highest since late 2014 at $82.18. Analysts are divided over whether energy supplies are tight enough to warrant oil testing $100 a barrel, but most seemed to agree prices are likely to stay elevated in the short-term. That helped basic materials and energy stocks in the S&P 500. They jumped 0.96% and 0.88% respectively, Refinitiv data showed, outperforming the broader market. Rising prices are also fueling bets that major central banks will tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later, lifting the dollar to a near three-year peak against the Japanese yen. In the United States, investors expect the Federal Reserve to begin tightening policy by announcing a tapering of its massive bond-buying next month. This has hobbled the yen, which is typically sensitive to interest-rate differentials. The yen weakened 1.02% against the greenback at 113.38 per dollar, and the dollar index  rose 0.238%. A stronger dollar pushed the euro  down 0.14% to $1.1551. Gold, usually seen as a hedge against inflation, fell as a stronger dollar offset any inflation-driven gains. Spot gold  dropped 0.2% to $1,753.42 an ounce. U.S. gold futures  fell 0.15% to $1,753.60 an ounce. Bitcoin , a barometer of investors' risk appetites, receded a touch but was still up a solid 4.4%.

business,"KKR's Bae, Nuttall succeed Kravis, Roberts as co-CEOs"," Oct 11 (Reuters) - KKR & Co Inc The transition has been in the works for years and is unlikely to surprise the firm's investors. KKR had named Bae, 49, and Nuttall, 48, as co-presidents in 2017. KKR said on Monday that Kravis, 77, and Roberts, 78, would remain involved in the running of the firm as executive co-chairmen. KKR's shares have tripled in value and its assets under management and distributable earnings have doubled since Bae and Nuttall officially became Kravis and Roberts' top lieutenants four years ago, KKR said. The shares were trading up 2% at $68.80 per share on Monday morning. ""We view the moves as orderly, and would not expect any breakage in assets under management or earnings,"" Citigroup Inc Nuttall and Bae will face a challenge replicating the successful working relationship of the two cousins who started KKR 45 years ago. From having their last names as two of the three initials in KKR to fostering a close-knit culture of old-school Wall Street loyalty, Kravis and Roberts have maintained a tight grip on the firm and helped shape the leveraged buyout industry. The move leaves Blackstone Group Inc In 2018, Carlyle Group Inc Nuttall and Bae both joined KKR in 1996. Nuttall had previously spent less than two years at Blackstone, while Bae had a similarly short stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc's Nuttall helped take KKR public, a process that involved merging the firm with an Amsterdam-listed fund in 2009 and then moving the listing to New York in 2010. He has been a fixture on the firm's quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts and also ran KKR's capital markets, insurance, credit, hedge funds and fundraising initiatives. Bae has been the main driver of KKR's expansion into Asia, making the firm one of the largest U.S. private equity investors on the continent. The Korean-American dealmaker also sat on the investment committees of KKR's global private equity business. By attracting money from some of the world's largest institutional investors such as pension plans and sovereign wealth funds, KKR grew from a single $30 million fund in 1978 to more than $429 billion in assets under management currently. These assets span private equity, real estate, corporate credit and hedge funds. KKR first gained widespread recognition through its $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988, a battle that was immortalized in the bestseller ""Barbarians at the Gate"". Its current investments include beauty products maker Wella AG and media group Axel Springer SE Kravis and Roberts have an estimated net worth of $8.6 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, according to Forbes. In addition to its leadership changes, KKR said on Monday it would take steps to eliminate its dual-class share structure. Carlyle was the first major publicly listed private equity firm to do this in 2019, followed by Apollo this year. KKR said that its common shareholders will be able to vote on a one-to-one basis on all major important issues, including the election of board directors. It added that this will be achieved though a complex web of mergers of KKR entities to be completed by 2026.

business,"Dollar attracts safe-haven flows, soars versus yen"," NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Monday as surging energy prices prompted investors to seek safe havens, with the greenback hitting a nearly three-year high against the yen on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce a tapering of its bond purchases next month. Oil prices surged on Monday to multi-year peaks, fueled by the rebound in global demand. Concerns that the price rises may exacerbate global supply-chain backlogs caused Wall Street to give up early gains. ""Risk aversion is kind of settling in,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at FX broker Oanda. ""We?�re not going to get any answers on the global energy crisis or inflationary pressures anytime soon and those risks are likely to keep a lot of investors focused on safety in the short-term,"" he said. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was up 0.174% at 94.328 , not far from its one-year high of 94.504 touched earlier this month. U.S. fixed income markets are closed on Monday for a holiday but the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries  hit a four-month high of 1.617% on Friday, even after data showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September, missing forecasts. However, data for August was revised up sharply and the jobless rate dropped to an 18-month low, suggesting fears of labor shortage remain justified, keeping inflation worries alive and giving the Fed justification to reduce its emergency stimulus begun last year. The yen, which is known for being particularly sensitive to interest rate differentials, hit 113 yen per dollar  for the first time since December 2018. With Japanese government bond rates well anchored and the Bank of Japan keeping policy on ice, expectations of a Fed tapering announcement soon should press U.S. Treasury yields higher, favouring higher dollar-yen ranges, said Roberto Cobo Garcia, head of FX strategy at BBVA. The main risk for the dollar-yen pairing this week comes from U.S. data, with consumer price index and retail sales both due. ""Investors need to be a bit careful, because if inflation and consumer spending numbers this week fall short, it will be very hard for the dollar to hold onto its gains,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management. The Australian dollar  hit its strongest since Sept. 14, and was most recently up 0.57% against the dollar at $0.73505, helped by strong commodities prices and a partial reopening of Sydney, Australia's largest city. Concern about inflation is not limited to the United States, with supply disruptions and rising commodity prices affecting many countries. The British pound had risen in early London trading on growing expectations the Bank of England could raise interest rates to curb inflation, but faded later in the session over energy price concerns, last down 0.08% at $1.3607. Canadian markets were closed for a holiday, but the loonie touched a two-month high of C$1.24465 thanks to surprisingly strong Canadian payrolls data released on Friday and lofty oil prices.

business,Marketmind: Earnings face the inflation test," Oct 11 - A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni. After weeks of debate about the supposedly transitory nature of higher inflation and its potential monetary policy implications, markets are about to find out how rising input costs impacted companies during the third 2021 quarter. As the reporting season kicks off in earnest from this week, commodity price rises, labour shortages and supply bottlenecks will be the main story, taking over from the absolute recovery narrative of the previous two quarters. But with world stocks down as much as 6% from last month's record highs, it's anyone's guess whether the margin squeeze is already priced in. Asia started Monday on the upside but European and U.S. equity futures suggest some caution, possibly as oil prices extended their multi-week gains, pushing Brent crude to new three-year highs. Still, investors may be coming to terms with a more moderate economic growth pace. Nineteen S&P 500 firms report earnings this week starting with the big banks; Refinitiv IBES forecasts profit growth at 30% this quarter, down from 96% in the previous three-month period. Companies may also find it harder in future to engage in tax arbitrage -- a common practice in particular among tech and pharma firms -- after 136 nations agreed on Friday to implement a 15% minimum tax rate on big firms. Meanwhile, hawkish central bank noise continues. Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders told households to get ready for ""significantly earlier"" interest rate rises. He spoke shortly after BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said above-target inflation was concerning and had to be managed A Polish rate setter too said last week's surprise rate hike was the beginning of normalising monetary policy. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: * Japan households expect inflation to pick up - BOJ survey * Goldman cuts forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2021 and 2022 *Chinese developer Modern Land asks to delay bond repayment - WSJ * Yellen confident U.S. Congress will pass minimum global corporate tax * ECB Board Member Frank Elderson, Philip Lane * World Bank/IMF meetings * Fed speakers: Chicago Fed President Charles Evans Our Standards: France wants to be a leader in green hydrogen by 2030 and build low-carbon planes and small nuclear reactors as part of a 30 billion euro ($35 billion) investment plan, President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday."

Claims that she pressured World Bank staff to change data to boost China's ""Doing Business"" ranking when she was World Bank CEO are looming over the opening of week-long IMF-World Bank annual meetings on Monday. Georgieva has strongly denied the allegations, which date back to 2017. The IMF's 24-member board plans to meet on Monday to decide Georgieva's future, people familiar with the plans said on Sunday after meeting with her and the law firm that made the allegations. ""Our opinion is that most of the elements are on the table, (and) the law firm's report does not detail precise elements that would directly call the director general into question,"" the French Finance Ministry source said. ""That's why France gave its support to the director general and would like that today we can take a decision, as the board said 'very soon', to get on with the IMF's work,"" the source added. France and other European governments on Friday backed Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, to complete her term as IMF chief, while U.S. officials and others had sought more time to study the differing accounts about data irregularities. Europe's backing is important since the IMF chief has traditionally been chosen by European governments, with the U.S. administration nominating the World Bank's president.

business,France's Carrefour and Auchan end talks over $19.4 bln tie-up," PARIS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Carrefour The potential deal to create a retailer with combined sales of 110 billion euros per year and a French market share of nearly 30%, had looked too complex in terms of valuation and structure, a source close to the matter told Reuters. A second source familiar with the talks said Auchan had offered Carrefour 21.50 euros per share, or 16.8 billion euros ($19.4 billion), comprised of 70% in cash and 30% in shares of the combined company. That's more than 30% above Carrefour's share price last week. But Carrefour ended the talks after its top shareholder, the Moulin family, opposed the deal - mainly on valuation grounds, the source added. A person close to the Moulin family, however, told Reuters the family had opposed the tie-up because it ""lacked industrial rationale"" and could raise competition issues as well as threaten jobs in France. In January, Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard This left Carrefour without the extra firepower to galvanise a turnaround plan Chairman and CEO Bompard was reappointed in May to lead for another three years. The extra resources offered by Couche-Tard would have boosted Carrefour's e-commerce roll-out, a priority as it looks to retain an edge over Amazon The discussions with Auchan, which started in the spring, reviewed various scenarios ranging from equity tie-ups to asset swaps and technological partnerships, the first source said. It was unclear if there was potential for talks to be revived. The second source said Auchan, owned by the Mulliez family, did not plan to make a hostile move for Carrefour. CONSOLIDATION Analysts have expressed concern that an Auchan-Carrefour merger would increase exposure to the struggling hypermarket store format. Some, however, have said a deal could generate cost savings and buying synergies. Bompard has repeatedly said the retail sector is bound to consolidate and his mission is to ensure Carrefour emerges as a winner. In 2018, Carrefour and French rival Casino Carrefour said in June it had also started considering possible tie-ups and divestments for its foreign subsidiaries, but that it had not made a decision to sell any assets.

business,Analysis: Corporate business travel 'carbon budgets' loom for airlines," SYDNEY/BOSTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - As major companies look at drastic ways to cut carbon emissions from corporate travel, airlines are bracing for a major hit to business-class travel, a key revenue driver, industry executives and experts say. Several companies, such as HSBC Some are considering a ""carbon budget"" as they come under growing pressure from environmental advocates and investors to reduce indirect emissions that contribute to climate change. Flights account for about 90% of business travel emissions. That makes it the lowest-hanging fruit for companies setting reductions targets. The airline industry ""It's going to be hard on airlines and they're going to need to adapt,"" Kit Brennan, co-founder of London-based Thrust Carbon, which is advising S&P and other clients on setting up carbon budgets. ""I think what we're going to see, funnily enough, is more of an unbundling of business class where you might get all perks of business class without the seat,"" he said, referring to airport lounges and nicer meals. ""Because ultimately it all comes down to the area on the aircraft and it takes up."" Flying business class emits about three times as much carbon as economy class because the seats take up more room and more of them are empty, according to a World Bank study. CHANGE ALREADY UNDER WAY Pre-pandemic, about 5% of international passengers globally flew in premium classes, accounting for 30% of international revenue, according to airline group IATA. The pandemic-related drop in travel and a switch to more virtual meetings have led many companies to save money by resetting travel policies. Sam Israelit, chief sustainability officer at consulting firm Bain, said his company was evaluating carbon budgets for offices or practice areas to help cut travel emissions per employee by 35% over the next five years. ""I think more broadly, it's something that companies really will need to start to do if they're going to be successful in meeting the aggressive targets that everyone's putting out,"" he said. Companies and corporate travel agencies are also investing heavily in tools to measure flight emissions based on factors such as the type of plane, the routing and the class of service. ""We're not seeing a lot of companies take a very draconian approach like simply cut travel because that impacts their bottom line,"" said Nora Lovell Marchant, vice president of sustainability at American Express Global Business Travel. ""But we are seeing an increased ask for transparency so those travellers can make decisions."" Global ratings agency S&P, which plans to reduce travel emissions by 25% by 2025, found that 42% of its business class use was for internal meetings, its global corporate travel leader, Ann Dery, said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event last month. AIRLINES GOING GREEN U.S. carrier JetBlue ""Businesses, of course, are going to want to address this climate change issue aggressively,"" JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said on the sidelines of the Boston meeting. ""But we think they're going to be able to do it in a way that still enables business travel to take place."" The emissions target airlines set last week relies on boosting use of sustainable aviation fuel from less than 0.1% today to 65% by 2050 as well as new engine technologies. ""If we are getting to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 everybody has got to play their part here,"" said Air New Zealand Our Standards: Private business jets once provided refuge from airport waiting lines for the few that could afford them, but the fading pandemic has driven demand to such heights that even wealthy travelers now face cancellations and delays."

That jobs data released on Friday pushed U.S. bond yields higher, and so the yen, which is known to be most sensitive to yield differentials, slipped to as low as 112.725 yen per dollar  in Asian hours on Monday - a level last seen in December 2018.

But to extend its gains further to 114 yen would require a much larger rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasuries to nearly 2%, which I don't think likely at this stage,"" said Jun Arachi, senior strategist at Rakuten Securities. The Japanese currency was also hurt by a slight tilt towards riskier currencies as sterling and the Australian dollar both gained slightly on the greenback, leaving the dollar's index little changed at 94.154 , not far from its one-year high of 94.504 touched earlier this month. U.S. currency and fixed income markets are closed on Monday for a holiday but benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield  hit a four-month high of 1.617% on Friday, even after data showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September, significantly underperforming economists' forecasts.

business,China to set assessment measures to regulate data sent abroad by cars," BEIJING, Oct 11 (Reuters) - China, the world's biggest auto market, said on Monday it will roll out assessment measures to regulate data sent abroad by vehicles, as the country steps up efforts to protect data and privacy. As cars become 'smarter' with more in-car entertainment, information and autonomous driving functions, automakers and tech companies are gathering more data from vehicles, raising privacy and security concerns. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not offer details about how the assessment would be done. According to current rules, auto companies cannot export key vehicle data abroad unless they obtain approval from regulators. The ministry said regulators will improve monitoring of vehicle data security and encourage telecommunication companies to invest more in cyber security technologies. The move comes amid China's push to ensure the security of data as the proliferation of smart cars, such as Tesla Beijing has been increasingly concerned over the mountains of data amassed by private firms and whether such information could be attacked or misused, especially by foreign states.

business,Dollar hits highest vs yen in nearly 3 years as markets retain Fed taper bets," LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest in nearly three years versus the yen on Monday as investors remained confident the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce a tapering of its massive bond-buying next month despite softer U.S. payrolls figures. The jobs data released on Friday pushed U.S. bond yields higher, and so the yen, which is known for being particularly sensitive to yield differentials, slipped to as low as 112.84 yen per dollar in early London trading on Monday - a level last seen in December 2018. The Japanese currency was also hurt by a slight tilt towards riskier currencies as sterling and the Australian dollar both gained slightly on the greenback, leaving the dollar's index a touch lower at 94.137 , but not far from a one-year high of 94.504 touched earlier this month. The yen has also been weighed down by the continued crude oil rally, given Japan's status as a net oil importer, said Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX, adding that the currency is also hobbled by monetary policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and its peers, driving a widening yield differential. ""The yen has seen broad selling pressure for the 3rd straight day,"" said Kruger. ""This is down to a feedback loop with the Japanese stock rally, while broader sentiment has been lifted by PM Kishida's capital gains tax comment."" Japan's Nikkei 225 stock market index rose for a third straight session on Monday, extending its recovery from a six-week low marked last week, as a sharp decline in the yen boosted exporters while a drop in COVID-19 infections added to economic reopening hopes. Also underpinning stocks, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Monday he will prioritise boosting wages through tax incentives, rather than imposing higher levies on capital gains and dividends to address Japan's income gap. U.S. currency and fixed income markets are closed on Monday for a holiday but benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield hit a four-month high of 1.617% on Friday, even after data showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September, significantly underperforming economists' forecasts. However, data for August was revised up sharply and the jobless rate dropped to an 18-month low, suggesting fears of labour shortage remain justified, keeping worries about inflation alive and giving the Federal Reserve justification to reduce its emergency stimulus begun last year. ""Although the headline payroll figure was weak, when you look into details, the outlook remains solid and there isn't anything that would prevent the Fed from tapering next month,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist at Barclays. The Chinese yuan was little moved by the ongoing travails of Chinese developer China Evergrande Group The offshore yuan was last at 6.4370 per dollar towards the top end of its recent range, but still short of its high of 6.422 hit in September. The Australian dollar firmed a little, edging nearer to its highest in a month, helped by strong commodities prices and a partial reopening of Sydney, Australia's largest city. Concern about inflation is not limited to the United States, with supply disruptions and rising commodity prices affecting many other countries. The British pound held firmer at $1.3634 , extending its recovery from a nine-month low set late last month, on growing expectations that the Bank of England could raise interest rates to curb soaring inflation. The Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2450 per U.S. dollar , having hit a two-month high of C$1.24465 thanks to surprisingly strong Canadian payrolls data and lofty oil prices. On the other hand, the euro was soft at $1.1575 , hovering a tad above its Wednesday's low of $1.1529, its weakest level since July last year.

business,Home from home: Mercedes-Benz doubles down on China," BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz, the German company founded by the inventors of the motor car, is pouring more resources into its cutting-edge research and design capabilities in China as the centre of gravity of the new auto world shifts eastwards. In a drive to create a ""home away from home"", Mercedes-Benz is doubling down on bases in Beijing and Shanghai to stay ahead of regulations and consumer trends in a car market that outstrips the United States and Germany combined. Three years after initially announcing plans to strengthen its research and development (R&D) in the country, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler Reuters has spoken to four people close to the tech centre and the brand's Chinese design studio who are familiar with the company's new China strategy. All declined to be named because they are not allowed to speak with the media. With 1,000 engineers, the new tech centre is more than three times the size of the one Mercedes-Benz opened in 2014 and the first outside Germany that can test ""everything"", putting it more ""on par"" technically with the far bigger R&D headquarters near Stuttgart, a person close to the centre said. Mercedes-Benz has also invested significantly in upgrading its Chinese design studio and has moved the whole team from Beijing to Shanghai, a megalopolis of about 25 million people known as the car design capital of China. Mercedes-Benz has good reason to elevate its Chinese operations. Its car sales in China jumped 12% last year to a record 774,000 despite the pandemic, streets ahead of its next two markets, Germany on 286,000 and the United States with 275,000. About 80% of the cars it sold in China were also made there, typically with an array of China-only features and models, and Asia overall accounted for almost half its global sales in 2021. China's auto market, the biggest in the world since 2009, is expected to carry on growing steadily, with demand forecast to reach 35 million vehicles by about 2030 versus 25 million now. 'SECOND HOME' But Mercedes-Benz, like all foreign automakers in China, is under growing pressure from local EV startups such as Xpeng , Li Auto and Nio That's why the German carmaker's ""second home"" strategy for China is focused on making its design and technology more agile, to respond quickly to the ever-shifting landscape and to firmly entrench the Mercedes-Benz brand, the four sources said. ""The expectations in China are for the in-car experience to be served by a localised digital services ecosystem, and such solutions must be conceived and built by people that live in China and truly understand the mobile internet,"" Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai, said. Mercedes-Benz customers in China are 36 years old on average - roughly 20 years younger than in Germany - and are more tech-savvy, but they are also notoriously disloyal, hopping from brand to brand as trends shift. Mercedes has spent 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million) upgrading the centre, with much of the investment ensuring it can do an array of testing locally - rather send new technologies back to the Sindelfingen headquarters in Germany. ""A key reason for the expansion is to gain the proximity to those customers and their needs,"" the person close to the tech centre said. ""Here, we finally have everything we need to test the car fully,"" said the source. The centre has modern chassis test benches and others including for noise, vibration and harshness, as well as batteries and e-drive powertrains and it has the flexibility to swap in new ones as technology develops, two sources said. Mercedes has also added functions deemed important for Chinese customers, such as a team dedicated to intelligent, connected electric vehicle (EV) technology. ""Tech savvy customers here require that you're very local in terms of intelligence, connectivity and autonomous driving,"" one of the sources said. THINK ROSE GOLD All four sources said a sharper focus on the customer in China in recent years is already paying off. A drive to create China-only colours led to research into the preferences of younger luxury goods buyers. While sensitive to being seen as hip and tech-savvy, there has been a revived interest in styles inspired by China's ancient dynasties. As part of that research, the studio came up with ""rose gold metallic"", a variation on rose gold tones adjusted for cars first used as an exterior colour for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class L sedan in 2018. New EVs such as the EQA and EQB now come in rose gold, and it's also an interior tone in the EQC. ""Global ideas, inspired by China,"" said one source close to the studio, adding that while Mercedes needs to cater to its China customers first, some China-grown ideas will go global. Moving the studio to Shanghai was partly driven by the need to significantly speed up the design process by making it more digital, as most virtual model-making vendors are based there. ""Besides, Shanghai is a lot easier a place to recruit design talent,"" said the source close to the studio, which is just north of city's prime waterfront district The Bund. Designers typically sketch a car on paper or a touch-sensitive computer screen and expert modellers then help sculpt the designs into clay models. Mercedes-Benz plans to more or less do away with those physical models. Under the new process, the Shanghai studio will review its designs using virtual tools, except for the occasional quarter-size physical models, according to one of the four sources. If the studio makes it to the final of internal competitions for car designs, it will send designers and modellers to the main studio in Germany to create life-size models for the last round, the source said. RULES OF THE ROAD Daimler's drive to strengthen its technology development in China also comes at a time when the cost of failing to be in step with Beijing policymakers has never been higher. Beijing's sweeping regulatory crackdown in recent months has wiped billions of dollars off the value of some of the country's best-known private firms, and has weighed on the auto sector. That's partly because tensions between the United States and China have created a tricky environment for foreign companies to import technology developed elsewhere. And from battery technology to new kinds of mobility including smart connectivity and autonomous driving, Chinese policies and regulations are shifting and evolving rapidly. ""If you respond to change after policies and regulation kick in, it's too late,"" said one of the contacts close to Daimler. With that in mind, the tech centre works closely with the brand's external affairs team which keeps its finger on the regulatory pulse - and that has proved key when it comes to so-called vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, technology. V2X controls communications between a car and ""everything"" outside, from 5G cellular signals to low-earth-orbit satellites to smart traffic lights and cameras on the road. In China, vehicles will soon have to come with full-fledged V2X capabilities to achieve a top safety ranking under a new version of its vehicle safety evaluation system, or New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which is expected in 2025. ""We knew this regulation was going to be implemented. We started developing those self-drive technologies including V2X to be in compliance with the new law and did so well before new regulation kicks in,"" one of the tech centre sources said.

business,China's Harbin lends hand to property firms; Morgan Stanley upgrades sector view," BEIJING, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Harbin has become one of the first cities in China to announce measures to support property developers and their projects, which have been shaken by the deepening debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group Developers should get back part of their presale funds held in government escrow accounts as quickly as possible to relieve pressure on their cashflows, the government of Harbin, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province, said on Sunday in a statement on its website. Developers with good credit profiles are encouraged to re-embark on presale activities as soon as they are able to, the statement said. China's overall property investment and sales have been declining while growth in new home prices slow. In many inland cities, lacklustre demand has led many developers to hit the pause button on sales or offer discounts. Yan Yuejin, director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution, said he expected other cities to follow Harbin in announcing support for the sector, especially ""those under great pressure from high inventories, including some tier-three and four cities in central and western regions."" In a further positive sign for developers, Morgan Stanley lifted its view on China's real estate industry to ""attractive"" from ""in line"", saying regulators may relax their grip on the sector to help stabilise it and support the economy. China's property sector - which accounts for about a quarter of the country's gross domestic product - has been hit by tighter borrowing caps that have hurt cashflow as well as developers' ability to finish construction and raise funds for new projects. The crisis at Evergrande, which is grappling with some $300 billion in debt and has missed two coupon payments, has only added to those strains as investors fret that other developers are also susceptible to defaults. Morgan Stanley analysts said, however, that systemic risks have become more manageable as regulators and local governments have the experience and the mechanisms in place to deal with developer defaults. ""Debt restructuring will also be done at the holding company level, while the operating companies or property projects will remain in operation during the restructuring with the support of regulars and local governments,"" they said in a client note on Sunday. Additional measures from Harbin will include subsidies of up to 100,000 yuan ($15,500) for talented residents with skills and qualifications looking to buy homes for the first time. ""If policymakers were to make statements about assuring property projects completion and supporting restructure, it could alleviate concerns from home buyers and the financial system,"" Morgan Stanley said. Kenneth Ho, head of Asia Credit Strategy at Goldman Sachs, also said he thought China's policymakers would have zero tolerance for systemic risk and policy support would be forthcoming if there was more deterioration in property activity levels.

business,"China has won AI battle with U.S., Pentagon's ex-software chief says"," LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - China has won the artificial intelligence battle with the United States and is heading towards global dominance because of its technological advances, the Pentagon's former software chief told the Financial Times. China, the world?�s second largest economy, is likely to dominate many of the key emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and genetics within a decade or so, according to Western intelligence assessments. Nicolas Chaillan, the Pentagon's first chief software officer who resigned in protest against the slow pace of technological transformation in the U.S. military, said the failure to respond was putting the United States at risk. ""We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it?�s already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion,"" he told the newspaper. ""Whether it takes a war or not is kind of anecdotal."" China was set to dominate the future of the world, controlling everything from media narratives to geopolitics, he said. Chaillan blamed sluggish innovation, the reluctance of U.S. companies such as Google Google was not immediately available for comment outside business hours. Chinese companies, Chaillan said, were obliged to work with their government and were making ""massive investment"" in AI without regard to ethics. He said U.S. cyber defences in some government departments were at ""kindergarten level"". Chaillan announced his resignation at the beginning of September, saying military officials were repeatedly put in charge of cyber initiatives for which they lacked experience. A spokesperson for the Department of the Air Force said Frank Kendall, secretary of the U.S. Air Force, had discussed with Chaillan his recommendations for the department?�s future software development following his resignation and thanked him for his contributions, the FT said.

business,Facebook will try to 'nudge' teens away from harmful content," WASHINGTON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A Facebook Inc Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs, also expressed openness to the idea of letting regulators have access to Facebook algorithms that are used to amplify content. But Clegg said he could not answer the question whether its algorithms amplified the voices of people who had attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The algorithms ""should be held to account, if necessary, by regulation so that people can match what our systems say they?�re supposed to do from what actually happens,"" Clegg told CNN's ""State of the Union."" He spoke days after former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen testified on Capitol Hill about how the company entices users to keep scrolling, harming teens' well-being. ""We're going to introduce something which I think will make a considerable difference, which is where our systems see that the teenager is looking at the same content over and over again and it's content which may not be conducive to their well-being, we will nudge them to look at other content,"" Clegg told CNN. In addition, ""we're introducing something called, 'take a break,' where we will be prompting teens to just simply just take a break from using Instagram,"" Clegg said. U.S. senators last week grilled Facebook on its plans to better protect young users on its apps, drawing on leaked internal research that showed the social media giant was aware of how its Instagram app damaged the mental health of youth. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee?�s antitrust subcommittee, has argued for more regulation against technology companies like Facebook. ""I'm just tired of hearing 'trust us', and it's time to protect those moms and dads that have been struggling with their kids getting addicted to the platform and been exposed to all kinds of bad stuff,"" Klobuchar told CNN on Sunday after Clegg's interview. She said the United States needs a new privacy policy so that people can ""opt in"" if they favor allowing their online data to be shared. The United States also should update children's privacy laws and its competition policy, and require tech companies to make their algorithms more transparent, Klobuchar said. Clegg noted that Facebook had recently put on hold its plans for developing Instagram Kids, aimed at pre-teens, and was introducing new optional controls for adults to supervise teens.

business,"Singapore to forge on with economic recovery, c.bank on hold"," SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Singapore's economy will stay on its recovery path in the third quarter but the global spread of the Delta coronavirus variant has clouded the outlook and will likely prompt the central bank to stay on hold, a Reuters poll showed. Eleven of 13 economists forecast the Monetary Authority of Singapore will make no changes to its policy settings on Oct. 14. Two expect the MAS to tighten slightly and begin normalising its policy, in line with other central banks. Another poll showed analysts forecast the economy continuing to expand albeit at a more modest pace in the third-quarter. Preliminary data, also to be released on Thursday, may show the economy grew 6.6% on year, according to the median of 16 forecasts, versus 14.7% in the prior quarter on milder low base effects and stricter curbs after a rise in COVID-19 cases. ""We suspect what has likely held up relatively well are manufacturing and financial services, whilst some of the more contact-intensive segments such as retail/wholesale and food/lodging likely moderated more,"" Morgan Stanley economists said in a report last week. Singapore has fully vaccinated about 83% of its 5.45 million people against the virus but reimposed some coronavirus restrictions to buy time to prepare to live with the disease. The trade-reliant economy, which marked its worst ever recession last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to expand 6%-7% this year. On Saturday, the government said it was  opening borders to more countries for quarantine-free travel, in a major step towards resuming international links. Manufacturing has been a key pillar of the country's growth this year, in part due to strong electronics sector performance. Singapore's core inflation rate - the central bank's favoured price measure - hit a two-year high of 1.1% in August, but economists expect prices to stay benign over the short-term and gradually rise. The MAS expects core inflation to average 0??% this year. The central bank manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, rather than interest rates, letting the local dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band.

business,Fundraising by China property trust products slump amid Evergrande woes - media," SHANGHAI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Fundraising by Chinese property trust products tumbled over 40% in September from a month earlier, official Shanghai Securities News reported on Monday, as China Evergrande Group's troubles further dampen investor appetite toward the struggling sector. Newly-launched real estate trust products raised 16.2 billion yuan from investors in September, down 44.8% from the previous month, the newspaper said, citing data from investment advisory Usetrust. That follows a 24% decline in August, and a 25% fall in July. Evergrande's Chinese developers are already struggling amid government's lending curbs and surging cost of bond issuance. A rapidly shrinking market of property trust products could further squeeze funding channels of a sector suffering from slower home sales.

The firm previously expected 5.7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 and 4.4% growth in 2022, according to research released on Sunday from authors including its chief economist Jan Hatzius.

business,Oil settles up 1.5%; hits multi-year highs on surging demand," BENGALURU, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped on Monday to the highest levels in years, fuelled by rebounding global demand that has contributed to power and gas shortages in key economies like China. Brent crude  rose $1.26, or 1.5%, to settle at $83.65 a barrel. The session high was $84.60, its highest since October 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  gained $1.17, or 1.5%, to settle at $80.52, after touching its highest since late 2014 at $82.18. The pace of economic recovery from the pandemic has supercharged energy demand at a time when oil output has slowed due to cutbacks from producing nations during the pandemic, focus on dividends by oil companies and pressure on governments to transition to cleaner energy. A U.S. administration official on Monday said the White House stands by its calls for oil-producing countries to ""do more"" and they are closely monitoring the cost of oil and gasoline. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together known as OPEC+, have held back from boosting supply even as prices have risen. In July, the group agreed to boost output by 400,000 bpd to restore the 5.8 million bpd in supply curbs left from its 2020 deal to cut production in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Power prices have surged to record highs in recent weeks, driven by widespread energy shortages in Asia, Europe and the United States. Soaring natural gas prices have encouraged power generators to switch to oil. ""Everything is very much focused on the lack of supply returning at a time when demand appears to be roaring back,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler. ""There's the added dimension relating to the potential for fuel switching given global natural gas prices are so high, so it's been a combination of factors here that are just continuing to propel (oil higher)."" Analysts have estimated that switching from natural gas to oil could boost crude demand by anywhere from 250,000 to 750,000 barrels per day. In India, some states are experiencing electricity blackouts because of coal shortages. The Chinese government ordered miners to ramp up coal production as power prices surged. ""In broad terms, we have very strong demand for energy around Asia, Europe ahead of the upcoming heavy usage cycle. Oil prices likely to continue to advance here in the near term,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois.

The debt restructuring for its Australia assets will allow GFG to make a ""substantial upfront payment"" to Greensill Bank and Credit Suisse, with the balance paid in instalments until the new maturity date of June 2023, a statement from GFG said.

business,San Francisco Fed's Daly: Too soon to say job market 'stalling'," Oct 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. job market will continue to feel the effects of COVID-19, but it is too soon to say it is ""stalling,"" San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said on Sunday. ""It's going to have these ups and downs, especially with the Delta variant,"" Daly said on the CBS weekend news program ""Face the Nation"" when asked about a second straight month of disappointing job growth in September. ""So I think it's too soon to say it's stalling, but certainly we're seeing the pain of COVID and the pain of the Delta variant impact the labor market,"" she said. Daly's comments came after the Labor Department on Friday reported that just 194,000 new jobs were created last month, fewer than half the number expected by economists in a Reuters poll. While the unemployment rate dropped to an 18-month low of 4.8%, it was partly a factor of people leaving the U.S. workforce. Coupled with an equally disappointing employment report card for August, the recent data has raised concerns that the U.S. economy will take longer than expected to recoup the remaining 5 million jobs lost to the coronovirus pandemic, and that factors like high inflation, souring consumer sentiment and the persistence of COVID-19 will sap growth. Daly said she had always thought the Delta variant of the coronavirus would create headwinds for the economy, but she does not expect it to trigger a recession. ""I always expected Delta to take a toll, just not put us into another recession, and we're seeing that toll,"" she said. ""We're seeing this disrupt families, disrupt schooling, disrupt people's ability to get to work and feel safe about it."" ""Delta has taken a toll, but it hasn't yet derailed us,"" Daly said. ""As goes COVID, so goes the economy."" Asked about inflation, Daly said the price pressures U.S. consumers are facing are ""painful"" but are directly related to COVID-19 and are not expected to persist. That echoes her previous and many other Fed officials' assessments that the current bout of high inflation is ""transitory"" even if it has extended further than most policymakers had initially expected. ""Everyone's feeling the rising prices for energy, food, basic services, and that's painful because we aren't used to seeing it,"" Daly said. ""It's eye-popping in some categories."" ""We have these really anxious-to-get-out-there-and-spend consumers hitting the wall of supply constraints, and of course the prices are going to rise,"" Daly said. ""But I don't see this as a long-term phenomenon."" Daly and other Fed officials are engaged in discussion over when and how to start removing the extraordinary support they have provided for the economy during the pandemic. Even with Friday's soft payrolls report, Fed officials are still expected to press ahead with the first stage of that withdrawal as early as their next meeting in early November.

business,Dollar hits 2-1/2-year high against yen as Fed tapering seen on track," TOKYO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The dollar ticked up to a 2-1/2-year high versus the yen on Monday after a soft U.S. payrolls figure did little to alter market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce it will start tapering its massive bond-buying next month. The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September, with nonfarm payrolls increasing 194,000, way below economists' forecast of 500,000. Still, data for August was revised up sharply while the jobless rate dropped to an 18-month low of 4.8% due to people leaving the labour force. Average hourly earnings also increased 0.6% from 0.4% in August. All told, the spectre of labour shortage firmly remains in place, keeping worries about inflation alive and giving the Federal Reserve justification to go ahead with reducing its stimulus it started last year for pandemic relief. U.S. bond yields rose on the data, with the benchmark 10-year Treasuries yield  hitting a four-month high of 1.617%, boosting the dollar's yield attraction. The yen, known to be most sensitive to yield differentials, reacted by slipping to as low as 112.32 yen per dollar , a level last seen in April 2019. ""Although the headline payroll figure was weak, when you look into details, the outlook remains solid and there isn't anything that would prevent the Fed from tapering next month,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist at Barclays. ""The dollar/yen is now at the top end of its trading range, its 2019 peak of 112.40, so I do expect heavy selling there for now. Still, should it break that level, we could see the dollar rising to 113 or 114 handle quite easily,"" he added. The euro was soft at $1.1575 , hovering a tad above its Wednesday's low of $1.1529, its weakest level since July last year. The dollar's index stood at 94.09 , not far from its one-year high of 94.504 touched earlier this month. The U.S. currency could gain further if U.S. consumer price data due on Wednesday shows an upswing in inflation and boost expectations of an earlier rate hike next year after tapering, analysts said. On the other hand, with supply disruptions and rising commodity prices affecting many other countries, concerns about inflation is not limited to the United States. The British pound held firmer at $1.3623 , extending its recovery from a nine-month low set late last month, on growing expectations that the Bank of England could raise interest rates to curb soaring inflation. The Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2473 per U.S. dollar , having hit a two-month high of C$1.24525 on Friday thanks to surprisingly strong Canadian payrolls data and lofty oil prices. Elsewhere, the offshore Chinese yuan changed hands at 6.4438 per dollar , its Oct. 1 high of 6.4286.

JPMorgan reports on Wednesday, followed by BofA, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup on Thursday, and Goldman on Friday. The focus will also be on U.S. inflation and retail sales data, and minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting which should confirm that a November tapering was discussed. While the headline U.S. payrolls number on Friday disappointed, it was a partly due to reopening problems in state and local education while private sector employment was firmer. Indeed, with a lack of labour driving the jobless rate down to 4.8%, investors were more concerned about the risk of wage inflation and pushed Treasury yields sharply higher. Yields on 10-year notes  were trading up at 1.61%, having jumped 15 basis points last week in the biggest such rise since March. Bonds also sold off in Asia and Europe, with short-term yields in Britain hitting their highest since February 2020. Analysts at BofA warned the global inflationary pulse would be aggravated by energy costs with oil potentially topping $100 a barrel amid limited supply and strong re-opening demand. The winners in such a scenario would be real assets, real estate, commodities, volatility, cash, and emerging markets, while bonds, credit and stocks would be affected negatively. BofA recommended commodities as a hedge and noted resources accounted for 20-25% of the main equity indices in the UK, Australia and Canada; 20% in emerging markets; 10% in the Eurozone, and only 5% in the United States, China and Japan.

business,Wall St Week Ahead Energy price spike adds market risk as earnings arrive," NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock market investors are gauging whether more volatility is ahead because of surging global energy prices, which could drive up inflation, erode profit margins and pressure consumer spending. Stocks rebounded this week after Monday's losses left the S&P 500 Energy costs are a major factor for inflation, and will be a key topic as companies report third-quarter results in coming weeks. Oil prices have surged more than 25% since late August, with Brent  topping $80 a barrel and hitting three-year highs. Natural gas prices in Europe have rocketed, causing alarm among political leaders. Oil prices have a ""roughly neutral"" affect on overall corporate earnings, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, with every 10% increase in Brent prices boosting S&P 500 earnings per share by 0.3%. Energy shares have soared as crude prices climbed, yet higher prices could weigh on companies ranging from transportation to consumer discretionary firms. ""We are going to find out if this piece of the inflation puzzle is the straw that breaks the camel?�s back and actually starts cutting into margins,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""There are incremental costs to everything when energy prices go up."" Despite September's pullback, the S&P 500 remains up about 17% so far in 2021. Even as investors swooped in to buy the market's latest dip, some Wall Street strategists are pointing to risks that could come with jumping into equities. Analysts at Capital Economics said in a note that rising energy prices could put more upward pressure on bond yields. A jump in yields roiled stocks in recent weeks, particularly tech shares. If oil prices keep rising toward $100 a barrel, that ""could continue to weigh on sentiment,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""If we break that barrier, I think it will influence how people are forecasting economic growth and inflation and interest rates, which has broad implications for sectors and industries and markets,??Arone said. As oil gained since late August, the S&P 500 energy sector The energy sector comprises less than 3% of the weight of the S&P 500, however, and rising oil prices can raise fuel and other costs for companies such as transportation firms, while also threatening demand by leading consumers to pay more, such as for gas at the pump. JPMorgan strategists in a note this week outlined a basket of stocks negatively impacted by oil at $100 a barrel, including package delivery company FedEx In a note last week, U.S. economists at Deutsche Bank said the 101-cent increase in gas prices from a year earlier would be expected to lead to a reduction in income that can be spent on non-energy items of about $120 billion. However, the relative amount of consumer spending on gasoline and other energy expenditures has trended lower over the past 40 years, according to data from Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. The percent of personal consumption expenditures devoted to gas and other energy spending has fallen from over 6% in the early 1980s to 2.35% most recently, Janasiewicz said. And JPMorgan strategists said markets would be able to digest oil at $130 a barrel, as the economy and consumer ""were functioning just fine"" over 2010-15, when oil averaged above $100.

In a study entitled ""Easy Ride: why the EU truck CO2 targets are unfit for the 2020s,"" the climate group found that improvements in aerodynamics and fuel efficiency meant that  truckmakers are able to meet the EU's 2025 CO2 targets while only having to make only a few zero-emission long-haul trucks.

business,"UK business minister defends wages stance, says BoE can handle inflation"," LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The British government is right to focus on driving up wages, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said on Sunday, expressing confidence in the Bank of England's ability to curb rising inflation. BoE governor Andrew Bailey has said he is concerned about inflation running above the bank's target of 2.0%, describing the need to prevent rising prices becoming permanently embedded. During an interview with Times Radio focused on soaring energy costs and supply chain disruption caused by labour shortages, Kwarteng was asked whether the people should start preparing for an interest rate rise to tackle inflation. ""The bank is independent, and will take a view,"" he said. ""The bank's principal motive will be to try and curb inflation, I think that they're going to do a good job of that and we have to make sure that we can contain any rises in the cost of living."" In its September policy statement, the BoE nudged up its forecast for inflation at the end of the year to over 4%, and the bank's chief economist has warned the size and duration of the jump is proving greater than expected. But Kwarteng defended the Conservative government's plans to transform Britain into a high-wage economy, as set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a speech last week. Johnson's new economic model includes arguing that the best response to labour shortages in industries like haulage is for firms to raise wages rather than to allow higher immigration. ""I think rising costs always should trouble a business department. But I think also ... we need to have a focus on higher wages,"" Kwarteng said. Our Standards: British employers increased their payrolls to a record high in September, shortly before the end of the government's wage subsidies scheme, potentially encouraging the Bank of England's progress towards a first post-pandemic interest rate hike."

Producers of steel, glass, ceramics and paper and other sectors have said they may be forced to halt production unless the government does something about energy prices. ""It's a critical situation clearly,"" Kwarteng told the BBC, when asked about possible factory closures. In a separate interview with Sky News he said: ""We've got very, very high gas prices, very high electricity prices, we already have support in place for industries, and we're looking at ways that we can help industry."" Kwarteng also said he was working with finance minister Rishi Sunak on the matter. However, a Treasury source denied there were any such talks, fuelling criticism from the opposition Labour Party about the government response. ""The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other ... We need urgent answers on who exactly is running the show,"" Labour lawmaker and finance spokeswoman Bridget Phillipson said. Asked if there might be an energy price cap for industrial users like there is for consumers, Kwarteng told Times Radio: ""That's not something that we've talked about."" ""We're not in the business of bailouts. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that's what I'm focused on.""

I can't imagine our being there on December 3rd,"" Yellen said. Yellen said she was confident that Congress' Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, ""will be able to manage this so that we don't face this situation."" She ruled out invoking the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which says the validity of U.S. public debt ""shall not be questioned."" Some Democrats have argued that this could be used to invalidate the debt ceiling, but it would entail a legal fight that would likely go to the Supreme Court. Congressional Democrats are working on President Joe Biden's sweeping social safety net agenda, but have yet to agree on a target size for the multitrillion dollar spending bill. Yellen appeared open to the idea of means-testing some of the programs in the plan to target the Americans who need it most, a move supported by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has been pushing for a slimmer bill. ""There is a trade-off there. We know that programs that are universal have tended to be long-lasting and very popular,"" Yellen said. ""But there is also an argument for, you know, making sure that the highest income Americans perhaps don't get the benefit of a program that is most needed by those with lower income.""

Kishida, who has vowed to rectify wealth disparities, had previously said reviewing those taxes would be an option in addressing income gaps. The premier's new stance indicates his concern about jitters in the stock market caused by the prospects of higher tax levies. Kishida took the top job in the world's third-largest economy on Monday, replacing Yoshihide Suga, who had seen his support undermined by surging COVID-19 infections. ""I have no plan to touch the financial income tax for the time being ... There are many other things to tackle first,"" Kishida told a news programme on commercial broadcaster Fuji Television Network. ""Misunderstanding is spreading that I may do it soon. That will give unnecessary worry to people concerned, if not dispelled firmly."" Some investors have expressed concern that the new premier may press ahead with capital-gains tax hikes, signalling a turnaround from investor friendly economic policies pursued by Japan's longest-serving premier, Shinzo Abe, from 2013 to 2020. Some analysts had called for raising Japan's tax levied on investment income from the current 20% to raise more from the rich and fund steps to support low-income households. Others were sceptical about the impact such tax hikes may have on correcting wealth disparities. Kishida's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) made no mention of reviewing taxes on capital gains and dividends in its campaign platform for the Oct. 31 general elections, a draft obtained by Reuters showed.

business,Evergrande creditors fear imminent default as concerns shake sector," SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group Evergrande, which could trigger one of China's With Evergrande staying silent on dollar debt payments and prioritising onshore creditors, A group of bondholders have enlisted investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to advise them. Offshore bondholders want to engage ""constructively"" with the company, but are concerned about lack of information from what was once China's top-selling property developer, said Bert Grisel, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Moelis. ""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday. ""Unfortunately, so far, we have had a couple of calls with the advisers,"" but there had not been any ""meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information"", he said Evergrande, which faces nearly $150 million in offshore payment obligations next week, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Neil McDonald, a restructuring partner in the Hong Kong office of Kirkland & Ellis, said the bondholders would like more transparency, and hoped Evergrande would meet disclosure obligations under stock listing rules. The offshore bondholders are also demanding more information about Evergrande's plan to divest some businesses and how the proceeds would be used, the advisers said, adding that the creditors group they represent was growing. The two advisers said that, including the parties that have expressed an interest to be part of the group, they represent bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds. Evergrande said last month it would sell a $1.5-billion stake it owns in Trading in Evergrande shares has been halted since Monday pending a major deal announcement.

""Delhi could face a power crisis,"" Kejriwal said in a tweet in which he also shared a copy of a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging a shortage of fuel in power plants in and around Delhi. Kejriwal urged the federal government to divert supplies of coal and gas to utilities supplying the capital, saying the city housed strategic centres of national importance and supply was critical to hospitals and coronavirus vaccination centres. A crippling coal shortage has caused a supply shortage in states such as Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand, with residents in the regions experiencing power cuts stretching to up to 14 hours a day.

business,Analysis: Tesla speeds the EV industry's South by Southwest drive," AUSTIN, Texas, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's Electric vehicle startups and established automakers have lined up $24 billion in investments in new factories in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kentucky. CEO Elon Musk's The competition among states for electric vehicle jobs is intense, and has a political dimension. Democratic-leaning Blue States such as California are home to many electric vehicle buyers and EV company investors, who have strong views on climate policy. Many of the states getting EV jobs are politically conservative Red states, whose Republican governors are both supportive of the fossil fuel industry and eager to welcome electric vehicle manufacturers and their jobs with subsidies and regulatory streamlining. ""The Lone Star State is the land of opportunity and innovation. Welcome,"" Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted on Thursday after Tesla announced its move. Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, now faces the challenge of taking advantage of the Texas business climate without alienating workers recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area's vibrant technology industry. It also has to consider the big base of Tesla vehicle customers in more politically liberal states such as California and New York. ""Tesla does not want to invite criticisms or attacks from public advocacy groups accusing them of looking for a large incentive package or abandoning California at a time when the state is in peril,"" said John Boyd, principal of Boyd Company, a site selection firm. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday praised Musk for having invested in California, including its SpaceX facility, and creating jobs. But Newsom said the state also offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax subsidies to Tesla. ""Our regulatory environment helped create a company and grow that company."" UNIONIZING Detroit automakers such as Ford Motor Co That complex and related new operations in Kentucky could create 11,000 jobs. The United Auto Workers union quickly called on Ford to assure those would be union jobs. But in Tennessee and Kentucky, union membership is optional, and workers at other auto manufacturers in those states have so far rejected UAW organizing efforts. Musk had a public falling-out with California when regulators forced Tesla to suspend production during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. At one point, Musk threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future programs out of the state. Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, said he moved to Texas last year, and he has taken to his new home, wearing Western-style bandannas and shirts. California has income tax rates up to 13.3%, while Texas has no tax on personal income. California, however, also accounted for about 15% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2020. On Thursday, Musk said the headquarters move is not a matter of Tesla leaving California entirely, and said production from Tesla's Fremont assembly plant and Reno, Nevada, battery factory will rise by 50%. Employees at Tesla's Palo Alto area offices expect engineers to stay in Silicon Valley, though some finance staffers could move, one source said. One awkward issue for Texas officials and Tesla to sort out is that Texas law currently forbids Tesla from selling vehicles directly to customers in the state. Austin is the fastest-growing U.S. metropolitan region, its population growing 30% between 2010 and 2020 to some 2.3 million. Like other large Texas cities, Austin and its surrounding Travis County, where the Tesla factory is located, are governed by Democrats, setting it apart from the majority of Texas' conservative, less densely populated counties. The Austin metro area is a technology hub, home to PC maker Dell Technologies Inc South Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics Austin's Democratic mayor, Steve Adler, welcomed the decision, saying Tesla will create ""the clean manufacturing, middle-skill jobs Austin needs."" Known for its quirky culture, Austin is also home to large music festivals such as Austin City Limits and South by Southwest, drawing large crowds each year. But the drastic growth and the influx of many well-paid Californians has faced resistance by some local residents, with reports of out-of-state buyers purchasing houses for cash at double the asking price, frustrating many Austinites.

Some developing countries that had wanted a higher rate said their interests had been sidelined to accommodate richer nations, while NGOs criticized the deal's many exemptions, with Oxfam saying it effectively had ""no teeth."" The accord also promises to be a Negotiations have been going on for four years, with the deal finally agreed when Ireland, Estonia and Hungary dropped their opposition and signed up. The deal aims to stop large firms booking profits in low-tax countries such as Ireland regardless of where their clients are, an issue that has become ever more pressing with the growth of 'Big Tech' giants that can easily do business across borders. ""Establishing, for the first time in history, a strong global minimum tax will finally even the playing field for American workers and taxpayers, along with the rest of the world,"" Biden said in a statement. Out of the 140 countries involved, 136 supported the deal, with Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka abstaining for now. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has been leading the talks, said that the deal would cover 90% of the global economy. ""We have taken another important step towards more tax justice,"" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ""We now have a clear path to a fairer tax system, where large global players pay their fair share wherever they do business,"" his British counterpart Rishi Sunak said. But with the ink barely dry, some countries were already raising concerns about implementing the deal. The Swiss finance ministry In the United States, meanwhile, Republican senators said they were concerned the Biden administration was considering circumventing the need to obtain the Senate's authority to implement treaties. Under the Constitution, the Senate must ratify any treaty with a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes. Biden's fellow Democrats control only 50 seats in the 100-member chamber. And Republicans in recent years have been overwhelmingly hostile to treaties and have backed cuts in corporate taxes. The reaction to the deal from U.S. markets was muted, with investors focused instead on the latest payrolls data. Some of the Big Tech companies, often cited by critics for seeking to lower taxes through operations overseas, welcomed the accord. ""We are pleased to see an emerging international consensus,"" said Nick Clegg, Facebook Inc vice president of global affairs. ""Facebook has long called for reform of the global tax rules, and we recognise this could mean paying more tax, and in different places."" An Amazon.com Inc Analysts at Morgan Stanley said that tech hardware, some media services, and healthcare appeared to be the most exposed to a 15% minimum tax rate. 'INCREASED PROSPERITY' Central to Yellen hailed it as a victory for American families as well as international business. ""We've turned tireless negotiations into decades of increased prosperity ??for both America and the world. Today's agreement represents a once-in-a-generation accomplishment for economic diplomacy,"" Yellen said in a statement. The OECD said that the minimum rate would see countries collect around $150 billion in new revenues annually while taxing rights on more than $125 billion of profit would be shifted to countries where big multinationals earn their income. Ireland, Estonia and Hungary, all low tax countries, dropped their objections this week as a compromise emerged on a deduction from the minimum rate for multinationals with real physical business activities abroad. 'NO TEETH' However, many developing countries have said their interests have been ignored and that wealthy nations were likely to continue Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said on Thursday that the proposals forced developing countries to choose between ""something bad and something worse"". Campaign groups such as Oxfam said that the deal would not end tax havens. ""The tax devil is in the details, including a complex web of exemptions,"" Oxfam tax policy lead Susana Ruiz said in a statement. ""At the last minute a colossal 10-year grace period was slapped onto the global corporate tax of 15%, and additional loopholes leave it with practically no teeth,"" Ruiz added. Companies with real assets and payrolls in a country can ensure some of their income avoids the new minimum tax rate. The level of the exemption tapers over a 10-year period. The OECD said that the deal would next go to the Group of 20 economic powers to formally endorse at a finance ministers' meeting in Washington on Oct. 13 and then on to a G20 leaders summit at the end of the month in Rome for final approval. Countries that back the deal are supposed to bring it onto their law books next year so that it can take effect from 2023, which many officials have said is extremely tight.

The IMF said the board had made ""significant progress"" in its review of the World Bank data-rigging scandal, but agreed to request ""more clarifying details with a view to very soon concluding its consideration of the matter."" It was not immediately clear if the board would meet again before the start of next week's high-profile meetings of the IMF and World Bank, where Georgieva is due to play a prominent role in presenting the global lender's newest economic forecasts. Some European governments backed the Bulgarian economist to remain IMF chief at Friday's marathon meeting, according to people familiar the matter. Other officials sought more time to review discrepancies between accounts by Georgieva and the WilmerHale law firm hired by the World Bank to investigate data irregularities in its flagship Doing Business reports.

business,Explainer: Why is Invesco entangled in a legal dispute with Indian TV giant Zee," NEW DELHI, Oct 9 (Reuters) - India's Zee Entertainment Zee has said it has tightened its governance processes. But the dispute comes at a fraught time for one of India's biggest news and entertainment TV groups as it recently started merger talks with the local unit of Japan's Sony Group Corp Here is what the Invesco-Zee dispute is all about: WHAT ARE INVESCO'S DEMANDS? Invesco's legal filings reviewed by Reuters - which are not public - show it wants changes at Zee in light of corporate governance and financial irregularities that have plagued the company, and have even been flagged by India's market regulator. Invesco's Developing Markets Fund and its OFI Global China Fund LLC own a near 18% stake in Zee. They have suggested six new independent board members to be appointed and remove Zee's current CEO, Punit Goenka. Invesco asked Zee on Sept. 11 to call an ""extraordinary general meeting"" of shareholders to consider its demands. HOW DOES ZEE VIEW INVESCO'S DEMANDS? Zee on Oct. 1 rejected Invesco's request to revamp the board, saying that the move had legal infirmities. Invesco then took the battle to India's companies tribunal, where it is trying to force Zee to call the meeting, saying Zee's behaviour is ""oppressive"". Zee has two weeks to respond, as per a tribunal order on Friday. The Indian TV giant says that it has implemented corrective plans to address concerns raised by the market regulator and that it follows ""highest standards of governance"". It remains unclear which way the shareholders will vote if a meeting is called, but Zee's founder Subhash Chandra, father of CEO Goenka, has accused Invesco of plotting a hostile takeover. ""They want to take over the company against Indian laws,"" Chandra has said. Invesco hasn't commented on the allegation. IS THE ZEE-SONY DEAL AT RISK? While Invesco was pushing for a Zee shareholder meeting, the Indian giant announced its merger talks with Sony. The deal terms say Goenka plans to continue to be the CEO of the merged entity, which will be majority owned by Sony. Invesco has in Indian tribunal hearings said it's not against the Zee-Sony plan, but its filing does criticize how the two entered into talks. The Sony deal would allow Chandra's family to raise their shareholding to up to 20%, from 4% now, Invesco said, adding that it was ""plainly an attempt to distract the general public"" and stall the convening of a shareholder meet. ZEE PRIME-TIME APPEAL, BOLLYWOOD SUPPORT In an unusual public diatribe, Chandra made a prime-time TV appearance on Zee's Hindi news channel this week. ""I urge Invesco to behave like a shareholder not like the owner ... You want a fight, then I will fight back,"" Chandra said, teary-eyed as he spoke about Zee's journey in India. Zee, which has for years offered dozens of entertainment channels and shows in many local languages in India, is a household name. It is now finding support from Bollywood. ""Zee which was first Indian channel promoted by Indian nationalist ... (is) now hounded by American and Chinese investors. Pray Zee Entertainment remains in original Indian entrepreneur's passionate hands,"" film producer Boney Kapoor said on Twitter.

business,The kids are alright: finance's old guard sees generational change," Oct 8 (Reuters) - When Wall Street veterans gathered this week for one of their first in-person conferences since the pandemic began, the focus, on emerging issues from ""meme stocks,"" to cryptocurrencies and free trading apps, signaled a new era for the world of finance. More than 460 finance executives, regulators and politicians met in Washington, with another 800 tuning in virtually, for the Security Traders Association (STA) annual conference, an event better known for rehashing dry decades-old issues from trading fees and market data to advances in algorithmic trading. But this year's gathering, which wrapped up on Friday, follows an extraordinary few months in which millions of young retail traders convening in online forums and trading through low-cost mobile apps have frequently piled into ""meme stocks"" - most notably video retailer GameStop The volatility of that episode was a common theme and for many participants the issues struck close to home: speaking in fireside chats and panels, several said their kids had been drawn into the market after retail brokers like Charles Schwab Corp Robinhood said at the end of last quarter it had 21.3 million active users, with an average age of 31, and that half of those were first-time investors. The company is also trying to recruit new users on college campuses, offering $15 to start investing and the chance to win $20,000 towards tuition. ""I'm thrilled that my kids are even talking about trying to invest and save and look towards the future,"" Republican lawmaker Bill Huizenga, who has five kids, aged 15 to 24. ""I would think we should be encouraging that,"" he added. Eric Pollackov, global head of ETF capital markets at Invesco, marveled that his son, a college sophomore, used a mobile app to buy an exchange-traded fund created by his firm that tracks U.S. long-term, investment-grade corporate bonds. ""What I love to watch in this industry ... is the adoption rate by all types of investors,"" he said. But while many participants cheered the emergence of a young new investing class, others sounded a note of caution. After what happened in the GameStop case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a consultation on game-like behavioral prompts some brokers use to drive transactions, amid worries young investors are being manipulated into risky trades. Allison Lee, a Democratic SEC commissioner, said her five children, all in their 20s and 30s, also use trading apps. Talking to them about market risks tends to ""bore them to death,"" she said, but she wants to ensure brokers give full disclosure around potential conflicts of interest and how they make their revenue, so everyone understands how they work. Cryptocurrencies are also drawing in young investors, including the children of ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo, known among crypto-evangelists as #CryptoDad for his support of the new industry. He recalled how a discussion during a family ski trip with twenty-somethings who had never shown interest in the markets before opened his eyes to ""a true generation gap.""

The head of the SEC has warned of widespread fraud in cryptocurrencies. STA head Jim Toes said protections were needed for this new generation of investors, noting that his 23-year-old was also engaging in the market for the first time.

business,United Steelworkers accuse Exxon of union busting at Texas refinery," BEAUMONT, Texas, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The labor union representing workers locked out of an Exxon Mobil Corp Any vote would be tainted by ""serious unfair labor practices,"" the USW said in a statement that accused Exxon of ""misleading people with confusing statements regarding our union, our negotiations and the company's spiteful lockout."" A majority of the plant's union members ""are still with us,"" Bryan Gross, a USW international representative, said of a vote's prospects. Exxon locked out 650 union workers from its Beaumont, Texas, plant on May 1 after the prior contract expired and there was no vote on the company's proposed offer. The refinery, which makes gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil, has continued to operate using managers and replacement staff. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) this week said it had received a petition backed by signatures from at least 30% of workers represented by United Steelworkers union local 13-243, the minimum required to call for a decertification vote to remove the union. If the Beaumont employees approve a decertification, it would remove the USW as their bargaining agent. NLRB has not determined whether or when a vote to remove the USW will be held, it said in a notice on Friday. Exxon has said its contract proposal contains provisions needed to ensure flexibility to compete in low-margin environments. The company stepped up its efforts to win a vote, accusing the union of sowing misinformation and engaging in voter suppression on the decertification effort. The USW has said the proposal would wipe out important worker seniority protections and, by creating separate contracts for the plant's refinery and lubricant oil plant employees,  dilute their negotiating power. USW and Exxon negotiators met on Friday, Gross said.

business,"School hiring decline, worker shortages curb U.S. job growth in September"," WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September amid a drop in hiring at schools and worker shortages, but ebbing COVID-19 cases and the end of generous unemployment benefits could boost employment gains in the months ahead. Though the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed the unemployment rate dropping to an 18-month low of 4.8%, that was in part due to people leaving the labor force. But there were signs of labor market tightness. Wage gains accelerated further, permanent job losses decreased and fewer people were experiencing long spells of unemployment. ""The biggest problem is not that growth has slowed, it is that people are still scared to go back to work,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. The survey of establishments showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 jobs last month. Data for August was revised to show 366,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 235,000 positions. Employment is Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 500,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000. The unemployment rate of 4.8% was down four-tenths of percentage point from August, while average hourly earnings increased 0.6% from 0.4% in August. The average workweek also lengthened by 0.2 hours to 34.8 hours. Employment gains were restrained by a drop of 161,000 in state and local government payrolls. Private education jobs fell by 19,000. Most back-to-school hiring typically occurs in September, but recruitment last month was lower than usual, resulting in a decline after stripping seasonal fluctuations from the data. Pandemic-related staffing fluctuations in education have distorted the normal seasonal patterns, making it difficult to interpret the data, the government said. The drop in public education jobs led to a decrease of 123,000 in government employment. That was offset by an increase of 317,000 in private payrolls. Employment in leisure and hospitality rose by 74,000 in September, with hiring at restaurants and bars rising 29,000. There were also gains in professional and business services payrolls. Retailers hired 56,000 workers, while manufacturers added 26,000 jobs. Construction payrolls rose by 22,000 jobs. With wage inflation rising, September's meager payroll gains probably will not deter the The U.S. central bank signaled last month that it could start tapering its asset purchases as soon as November. Economists expect that announcement will come at the Nov. 2-3 policy meeting. ""The bar was always quite low for a tapering of asset purchases to be announced in November and the combination of upward revisions, the drop in the unemployment rate, and signs of labor market tightness should more than meet it,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York. The likelihood of a taper was bolstered by the U.S. Senate agreeing on Thursday to raise the Treasury Department's borrowing authority until December. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in choppy trade. The dollar MIXED SIGNALS Despite the modest jobs gain, accelerating wage growth bodes well for the economic outlook, following an apparent sharp slowdown in growth in the third quarter. The economy hit a speed bump last quarter because of the summer flare-up in coronavirus cases, an ebb in the flow of pandemic relief money from the government, scarce labor and raw materials, which have hammered motor vehicle sales. The Atlanta Fed estimates that gross domestic product growth braked to a 1.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. But with COVID-19 infections decreasing and schools fully reopened for in-person learning, more people should be able to rejoin the labor force. In the months ahead, the labor squeeze could ease following the expiration of federal government-funded benefits in early September. These expanded benefits were blamed by businesses and Republicans for the failure to fill a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July. So far, many of the unemployed appear to be in no hurry to start looking for jobs, having saved a chunk of their government money. The smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived showed 183,000 people left the labor force in September. As result, the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, dipped to 61.6% from 61.7% in August. Some economists say a significant portion of people who dropped out of the labor force have retired, thanks to a strong stock market and record house price gains, which boosted household wealth. Self employment has also increased. ""Labor supply remains an important constraint and an issue that may very well not get resolved in a short time horizon,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Even though participation remains low, some aspects of the labor market are improving. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 58.7% from 58.5 in August. The number of long-term unemployed dropped by 496,000 to 2.7 million in September. They accounted for 34.5% of the 7.7 million officially unemployed people, down from 37.4% in August. The median duration of unemployment fell to 13.3 weeks from 14.7 weeks in August.

business,Four stand-out points in the September U.S. jobs report," Oct 8 (Reuters) - For a second straight month, U.S. job growth proved to be bitterly But the 41-page Not surprisingly, President Joe Biden cast his lot with the first group. ""Jobs up, wages up, unemployment down. That's progress,"" he said after the release of the report. Here are four data points that stood out. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS The unemployment rate fell for a third straight month and by much more than was expected. Now at 4.8%, it is 10 percentage points south of its peak level in April 2020. Most economists agree it is an imperfect measure of the health of the labor market, but it still factors heavily in both the average person's and typical policymaker's reckoning of the economy, and it is improving at a pace not seen after most recessions. In fact, the latest level is already where Federal Reserve officials on balance had estimated it would be at the end of the year. NO MORE $300 A WEEK Among the many superlatives in the September report, this one jumped off the page: The ranks of the long-term unemployed, or those out of work for more than half a year, fell by the most ever last month, with 560,000 people leaving those rolls. Why? Simple - the money ran out. A $300 a week federal supplement to standard state jobless benefits expired near the start of the month. The emergency program had been on its way out since the early summer when 26 mostly Republican-led states ended the benefits early. But the final cull occurred last month. The question now is how many of those people transition back into the job market in the months ahead. WAGE INFLATION? There's no shortage of anecdotes about employers enticing people back to work with higher pay, but given how noisy the data has been during the coronavirus pandemic, finding evidence of a real trend emerging has been challenging. The Labor Department's average hourly earnings data, however, has settled down in the past half a year and a new - and for now higher - growth pattern appears to be emerging. Average hourly pay rose 0.6% last month - again more than expected - and over the last six months has now averaged a gain of 0.5% per month. That's roughly twice the monthly wage increase that prevailed before the pandemic. SEASONAL ADJUSTMENTS Schools reopened this year in far greater numbers than a year ago when vaccines were still in the development stage and many public schools kicked off a year of hybrid or fully online instruction. So why did public school employment drop by 144,000 last month? Answer: It didn't. And it's all the fault of ""seasonal adjustments."" September is typically the strongest month for hiring at U.S. public schools, with roughly 850,000 jobs added at the start of each school year from 2000 through 2019. Then came the pandemic and September job growth at public schools in the last two years was 15-20% below that trend - throwing off the Labor Department's seasonal-adjustment models.

The value of the net long dollar position was $22.89 billion in the week ended Oct. 5, compared with $16.37 billion in the previous week. U.S. dollar positioning has been net long for 12 straight weeks after being net short for 16 months. U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Swiss franc, as well as the Canadian and Australian dollars. In a broader measure of dollar positioning , which includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the greenback posted a net long position of $22.535 billion this week, from $15.33 billion previously. The dollar has been on a tear since the September 21-22 Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting that suggested a possible tapering of the Fed's asset purchases starting November this year and ending in June 2022. Tapering tends to be dollar-positive because the Fed would be buying less debt assets, which means that there will be less dollars in circulation, making the currency more valuable. Since the September meeting, the dollar index  has risen more than 1%. The dollar pulled back, however, on Friday after an underwhelming U.S. non-farm payrolls report. Data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 194,000 jobs last month, compared with forecasts for 500,000 new jobs. But data for August was revised to show 366,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 235,000 positions. ""U.S. inflation data released next Wednesday may add to evidence that inflationary pressures are proving less 'transitory' than generally anticipated,"" wrote Jonathan Petersen, markets economist, at Capital Economics in its latest research note.

business,EXCLUSIVE Australia sees trade deal with EU by end-2022 -minister," ROME, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan said on Friday he expected to finalise a free trade agreement with the European Union by the end of next year, despite the EU's anger over Canberra's cancellation of a submarine contract with France. Brussels postponed the latest round of talks, which were due to start on Oct. 12, until November in solidarity with France after Australia scrapped the multi-billion dollar deal that Paris considered the cornerstone of its Indo-Pacific policy. Instead, it secretly negotiated to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with U.S. and British technology as part of a trilateral security pact between the three countries announced last month. Tehan, in Italy for a meeting of the Group of 20 developed countries, told Reuters in an interview he was not concerned by the delay in the talks, and reaching an agreement was strongly in the interests of both sides. Asked when he expected it would be finalised, he said: ""I suggest it's likely the end-game will take some time and we'll be looking towards the end of next year to conclude negotiations."" He played down the damage to EU-Australian relations over the submarine dispute, and said he had ""very good discussions"" with seven EU ministers at a meeting this week of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. It will be more difficult to mend ties with France, which described Australia's actions in walking away from the naval deal as a ""stab in the back"" and has so far declined any talks to patch things up. Tehan said Australia had issued an open to France. ""The most important thing is that we sit down so Australia can fully explain the decision we took because it was in our national interest,"" he said. France said on Oct. 6 week it would send its ambassador back to Australia to help redefine relations after recalling him for consultations in protest. Turning to the environment, Tehan rejected criticism of Australia for not having produced updated targets on reducing carbon emissions ahead of next month's United Nations climate talks, COP 26, in Glasgow. He said the plan Canberra presents in Glasgow to achieve net zero carbon emissions ""hopefully"" by 2050 was more detailed than those of many countries that had ambitious goals but did not explain thoroughly how they would achieve them. Tehan said Australia was pushing to have the major contribution of farm subsidies in carbon emissions addressed by the G20 and the World Trade Organization. He said agriculture and land use accounted for 25% of emissions and it was recognised it would be impossible for countries to meet their Paris agreement climate goals unless the question was tackled. ""So when it comes to issues that will help us reduce climate change we are in the forefront of pushing for action,"" he said.

business,Top fossil fuel lender JPMorgan joins UN climate action finance plan," NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co As the largest U.S. bank and a major lender to the fossil fuel industry, JPMorgan has been criticized for not joining the group, which launched in April, sooner. The announcement comes ahead of next month's UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP 26, in Glasgow. JPMorgan followed rivals Bank of America ""We are joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance because we support the ambition for greater climate action, the sharing of best practices and a collaborative approach between the public and private sectors to reach this goal,"" Marisa Buchanan, JPMorgan's global head of sustainability, said in a statement. Member banks are required to submit science-based climate plans that cover all types of emissions, include 2030 interim targets and commit to transparent reporting and accounting. Banks have 18 months to set the 2030 interim targets. Critics say the group's targets are too weak and flexible. ""Without a plan to stop funding the expansion of fossil fuels, commitments like this are completely inadequate,"" said Ben Cushing, fossil-free finance campaign manager at the Sierra Club.

business,Two Indian drugmakers to end trials of generic Merck pill for moderate COVID-19," BENGALURU, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Two Indian drugmakers have requested permission to end late-stage trials of their generic versions of Merck & Co's Merck earlier this year The Indian companies - Aurobindo Pharma Ltd Merck spokesperson Melissa Moody said Merck and the Indian companies had defined ?�moderate??disease differently. Merck's trials are based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration definitions, which for moderate COVID-19 describe blood oxygen levels as no lower than 93%. It defines blood oxygen levels for severe COVID-19 as 93% or lower. The trials in India define moderate COVID-19 blood oxygen levels as 90% to 93%, according to the trial documents for the two companies. Aurobindo and MSN are continuing to conduct studies of molnupiravir in patients with mild COVID-19 who have not been hospitalized, according to trial documents and the website of the Indian drug regulator's internal expert committee. Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics last week said molnupiravir had The Indian drug regulator's committee also disclosed on its website that Aurobindo and MSN had presented interim clinical trial data for moderate COVID-19 patients and asked to end the trials. A source with the Drug Controller General of India said An Aurobindo spokesperson did not comment on the effectiveness of the drug in its trial. The spokesperson said the company had ""faced challenges in patient recruitment at this juncture"" for its trial in moderate COVID-19 patients, adding ""we are evaluating the further course of action."" Aurobindo started the planned 100-patient trial of its generic version of the Merck pill against moderate COVID-19 in August, and is also running a trial that hopes to include 1,200 patients testing the pill against mild disease. MSN did not respond to a request for comment. INDIA TRIALS Merck, whose shares closed down 1.6% at $80.63, has entered into voluntary licensing agreements with at least eight Indian drugmakers for molnupiravir, with an aim to turn the South Asian nation into a manufacturing hub for the drug to supply low- and middle-income nations. Five of the eight Indian companies - Dr Reddy's Laboratories The other licensed company, Hetero, in early July announced interim data from its own late-stage trial of generic molnupiravir in mild COVID-19 patients and submitted an application to regulators for its emergency use.

business,"Mediobanca, top investor Del Vecchio reach truce on bylaws changes"," MILAN, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Mediobanca Welcoming the decision ""with deep satisfaction,"" Del Vecchio in turn withdrew a second proposal to amend the company's bylaws, which had been criticised by Mediobanca's board. Mediobanca also complained that Del Vecchio had failed to discuss with the company proposals he wanted to put to a shareholder vote at the Oct. 28 general meeting, disregarding what is considered standard practice for listed companies. Del Vecchio last month proposed modifying Mediobanca's governance rules to make the board more diverse and independent from management, in his first formal move to promote changes at the group since becoming its single largest investor. The 86-year-old founder of spectacles giant Luxottica bought 19% of Mediobanca after gaining clearance from European regulators on the condition that he would not interfere with the running of the bank. Del Vecchio in the past has been critical of the strategy of Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel, although he has praised Nagel's latest business plan. The two are also embroiled in a governance tussle at Generali Mediobanca said that while the company had benefited from having top managers among its directors, this was a statutory requirement it had been planning to axe next year in light of discussions with institutional investors and shareholder advisory firms. Mediobanca was critical of Del Vecchio's second proposal, which it said risked penalising institutional investors that own half of Mediobanca. Del Vecchio's holding company, Delfin, said late on Friday it would withdraw the proposal to avoid confusing investors,  given that Mediobanca's board had decided to present an alternative proposal if the one by Del Vecchio was rejected. At present, a majority of Mediobanca's directors come from the list that gets the most votes from shareholders, with two seats reserved for the second most-voted list. Del Vecchio had proposed increasing to three or four the number of seats reserved for the minority lists, which would each appoint a director based on the number of votes, provided they cross a 5% threshold. Under the alternative proposal by Mediobanca's board, a fifth of directors would come from minority lists, with at least one seat reserved for representatives of institutional investors. The 5% threshold would be lowered to 2%. ""Delfin has finally been able to set in motion a process to improve Mediobanca's governance ... to increase management's accountability,"" Delfin said. ""In light of this fundamental result, while Delfin believes its proposal is preferable ... it is in the interest of the bank and its shareholders ... that only the board's proposal get put to shareholders.""

business,Bayer blasts 'unscientific' rejection by Mexican regulator of GMO corn permit," MEXICO CITY, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Bayer is evaluating its legal options after Mexican health regulators for the first time rejected a GMO corn permit it was seeking, the German pharmaceutical and crop science giant said in a statement to Reuters on Friday, blasting the decision as ""unscientific."" Reuters reported earlier in the day that regulator Cofepris rejected the corn permit for future import as the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hardens its opposition to genetically modified crops. ""We are disappointed with the unscientific reasons that Cofepris used to deny the authorization,"" the statement said, identifying the rejected corn variety as using its proprietary HT3 x SmartStax Pro technology. Bayer stressed that the permit denial does not affect its current business, noting that last year the company stopped work on its HT3 hybrid corn varieties due to regulatory delays in the European Union in favor of a new HT4 line which the company expects to launch later this decade. Bayer nonetheless criticized what it described as continuous regulatory delays with Cofepris as well as the possibility of additional permit denials that could have a ""devastating impact"" on Mexican supply chains. The company said genetically modified crops including corn have undergone more safety tests than ""any other crop in the history of agriculture"" and have been judged safe for humans, animals and the environment. The Cofepris press office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Lopez Obrador issued a controversial decree at the end of last year that outlined a three-year plan to ban the weed killer glyphosate and GMO corn for human consumption. Industry associations have sharply criticized the plan and have sought unsuccessfully to persuade judges to strike it down, arguing that it risks a trade dispute with the United States. If the ban is interpreted to include animal feed or other industrial uses, they say it will ultimately hit consumers with higher food prices. The planned prohibition, however, is popular with environmentalists and health-food advocates who argue that spraying glyphosate on the GMO crops designed to tolerate them is indeed harmful. Glyphosate was pioneered by the Roundup brand of weed killers from agrochemical company Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer as part of a $63 billion acquisition in 2018. Our Standards: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that well-known foreign companies had engaged in what he described as fuel smuggling and he named global energy trader Trafigura as an example of the practice."

Microsoft introduced Teams in early 2017 to compete with Slack and others in the fast-growing workplace collaboration market. Slack, bought by business software maker Salesforce.com Microsoft, which has been handed 2.2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in EU fines for cases involving so-called tying and other practices in previous decade, declined to comment. Slack alleged that tying or bundling Teams with Office was illegal and urged the EU competition agency to separate the two. It said Microsoft pre-installs the workplace chat, it was difficult to un-install and that the U.S. company refused to provide information which would allow rival products to work with Teams and Office. This has prompted the Commission to ask if bundled products give companies access to data that may increase their market power in both markets and at the same time make it harder for rivals, in particular those with only product, to compete. It has also asked about barriers to entry or expansion in the workplace apps market, switching costs for customers and the importance of user data protection. Rivals were asked for a list of customers who have switched to Microsoft Teams or its bundled Office, the percentage of revenue they had lost as a result, as well as the impact of the integrated products on their investments in innovation and the quality and price of their products. The questionnaire asked if the COVID-19 had boosted demand for workplace apps and how this will evolve post-pandemic.

business,Consumer goods companies walk a tightrope as inflation surges," Oct 8 (Reuters) - Big global brands Pepsi and Levi Strauss told investors this week they offset inflation with price increases, but rising costs of everything from aluminum to cotton signal tighter times ahead for consumer goods companies. Freight costs and raw material prices have surged this year across industries due to global supply chain disruptions, squeezing profit margins at companies looking to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To cushion the blow, PepsiCo Inc While those companies were able to pass along costs to consumers, higher prices will be a headwind until at least the end of the year with some industries likely facing pressure until the middle of 2022, analysts have said. With government data showing inflation has started to dent consumer spending, companies must also balance the need to protect their margins with the risk that boosting prices will hit demand for their products. Analysts at Credit Suisse characterized the breadth of inflation PepsiCo faced as ""stunning"". ""We expect margin pressure to be the predominant theme through the rest of this earnings season,"" they said. J.P.Morgan's Andrea Teixeira said PepsiCo ""is feeling and will continue to feel the impact of inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges."" But Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's chief executive officer, is confident even as the company faces higher packaging material costs and truck driver wages. ""Across the world, consumer seems to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before,"" Laguarta said in an analyst call, highlighting the strength of the company's brands and innovations. That sentiment was echoed by Slim Jims maker Conagra Brands Inc However, some companies are feeling the pinch more than others. Corona beer maker Constellation Brands PepsiCo keeping up with demand during the pandemic while also grabbing market share has given the company strong pricing power, where as Constellation, which struggled to keep up supplies has comparatively less capacity to raise prices, said Markus Hansen, Portfolio Manager at Vontobel Quality Growth, which holds stakes in both PepsiCo and Constellation. ""PepsiCo wasn't shooting down the idea of price increases in the mid single-digit range - 4% or 5%. That's a pretty powerful thing,"" Hansen said, adding that for Constellation he was looking at a low single-digit range.

business,Trump's DC hotel lost millions despite foreign payments -U.S. House panel," WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's showcase hotel in Washington bled millions of dollars during his time in office even as he concealed payments from foreign governments, a U.S. House of Representatives panel said on Friday. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform said recently obtained government documents raised ""troubling"" questions about the Trump International Hotel, a historic building the Trump Organization leases from the federal government and a popular gathering spot for his supporters and for foreign dignitaries. According to the Democratic-controlled committee, Trump reported that the hotel earned him more than $150 million during his time in office but actually lost more than $70 million. The committee found that the hotel received over $3.7 million in payments from foreign governments - equal to more than 7,400 nights at the hotel, raising a potential conflict of interest. The hotel gave a portion of that money to the U.S. government but failed to provide full details of those payments to the General Services Administration, the federal government's property manager, the committee said. Its investigation was based on documents released by the GSA. Provisions in the U.S. Constitution prohibit the president from obtaining payments, or ""emoluments"", from foreign governments. Trump's lawyers have argued in court cases that his ownership of the hotel did not violate these constitutional provisions. A Trump Organization spokeswoman said the committee's report was inaccurate but did not elaborate. ""This report is nothing more than continued political harassment in a desperate attempt to mislead the American public and defame Trump in pursuit of their own agenda,"" Kimberly Benza said. The GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Congressional Democrats say the GSA stonewalled their investigation into Trump's businesses while he was in office, but in July 2021 finally produced some of the documents they had been seeking. The committee found that Trump moved millions of dollars through other businesses, complicating GSA's ability to enforce provisions that prohibited him from collecting profits from the hotel. The committee also found that he concealed debts when he was bidding for use of the property in 2011 and failed to disclose what it said were favorable loan terms from Deutsche Bank AG that financed renovations to the hotel. The House panel found that Deutsche Bank The committee said Trump did not disclose ""this significant benefit from a foreign bank"" while he was in office.

business,IMF still working to build support for new trust to help countries in need," WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Friday it is still building support among members for a proposed IMF officials have been racing to build support for the new trust, proposed by IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva in June, which would allow aid to countries outside the low-income nations served by the existing Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. The IMF is encouraging richer members to donate or loan their share of $650 billion in newly issued Special Drawing Rights (SDR) to vulnerable countries, but some countries say the new trust would move beyond the scope of the IMF. In a blog published on Friday, IMF strategy director Ceyla Pazarbasioglu and her deputy Uma Ramakrishnan said they hope to make progress on the Resilience and Sustainability Trust at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank next week. ""Building consensus is never easy; it takes time. Creative solutions are needed to bridge differences,"" they wrote. ""We are confident that with the international community?�s support, the RST is one such innovative solution which could become operational in just over a year."" They said the proposed RST would help build economic resilience and sustainability, especially in low-income countries and small states, as well as vulnerable middle-income countries, by lending at cheaper rates and with longer maturities than the IMF's traditional lending terms. They said members would agree on the purposes of the funding, which could include climate, pandemic preparedness and other ""worthy global public policy goals."" They noted that the trust needed to be able to provide liquidity for creditors who channeled their SDRs if they faced a balance of payments need themselves, as well as adequate credit risk protection for the donors. To that end, they said they were proposing a multi-layered credit risk protection framework with policy safeguards, financial buffers, and a diversified creditor and borrower base. They said RST lending would likely come in addition to a regular IMF-supported program, and would benefit from strong policy safeguards included in those programs. They said details were still being worked out on the size of the trust, eligibility requirements, conditionality, lending terms, and the financial architecture. ""We continue to engage with our membership and other stakeholders to ensure full buy-in, while working closely with other international financial institutions, especially the World Bank, to ensure that the RST is a part of a broader strategy for international country assistance,"" they said.

business,Explainer: What is the global minimum tax deal and what will it mean?," PARIS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A global deal to ensure big companies pay a minimum tax rate of 15% and make it harder for them to avoid taxation has been agreed by 136 countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Friday. The OECD said four countries - Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - had not yet joined the agreement, but that the countries behind the accord together accounted for over 90% of the global economy. Here are the main points of the accord: WHY A GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX? With budgets strained after the COVID-19 crisis, many governments want more than ever to discourage multinationals from shifting profits - and tax revenues - to low-tax countries regardless of where their sales are made. Increasingly, income from intangible sources such as drug patents, software and royalties on intellectual property has migrated to these jurisdictions, allowing companies to avoid paying higher taxes in their traditional home countries. The minimum tax and other provisions aim to put an end to decades of tax competition between governments to attract foreign investment. HOW WOULD A DEAL WORK? The global minimum tax rate would apply to overseas profits of multinational firms with 750 million euros ($868 million) in sales globally. Governments could still set whatever local corporate tax rate they want, but if companies pay lower rates in a particular country, their home governments could ""top up"" their taxes to the 15% minimum, eliminating the advantage of shifting profits. A second track of the overhaul would allow countries where revenues are earned to tax 25% of the largest multinationals' so-called excess profit - defined as profit in excess of 10% of revenue. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Following Friday's agreement on the technical details, the next step is for finance ministers from the Group of 20 economic powers to formally endorse the deal, paving the way for adoption by G20 leaders at an end October summit. Nonetheless, questions remain about the U.S. position which hangs in part on a domestic tax reform the Biden administration wants to push through the U.S. Congress. The agreement calls for countries to bring it into law in 2022 so that it can take effect by 2023, an extremely tight timeframe given that previous international tax deals took years to implement. Countries that have in recent years created national digital services taxes will have to repeal them. WHAT WILL BE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT? The OECD, which has steered the negotiations, estimates the minimum tax will generate $150 billion in additional global tax revenues annually. Taxing rights on more than $125 billion of profit will be additionally shifted to the countries were they are earned from the low tax countries where they are currently booked. Economists expect that the deal will encourage multinationals to repatriate capital to their country of headquarters, giving a boost to those economies. However, various deductions and exceptions baked into the deal are at the same time designed to limit the impact on low tax countries like Ireland, where many U.S. groups base their European operations.

business,Big investment hubs dodge a bullet in global tax overhaul," DUBLIN, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Ireland may have done the once unthinkable by giving up its prized 12.5% corporate tax rate in a global shakeup but it and other developed nations appear set to continue dividing up the spoils of foreign direct investment. Some 136 countries on Friday agreed the first major overhaul in a generation of the rules for taxing multinationals, with measures including a global minimum rate of 15% intended to discourage them from booking profits in low tax countries. Ireland's dropping of its opposition on the eve of the deal handed efforts a major boost. But many developing countries say their interests have been sidelined, while charity Oxfam called the agreement ""a rich country stitch-up"". ""We will continue to compete with largely the same jurisdictions,"" said Martin Shanahan, the head of IDA Ireland, the state investment agency that has convinced the likes of Apple Adding future technology giants to that list is still likely to mean going up against Berlin and London. For pharmaceuticals and medical devices, the toughest competition will come from Switzerland and Singapore. Shanahan has also pointed to Spain and parts of Eastern Europe in recent years as increasingly competitive in the race for multinational investments that directly account for one in six Irish jobs. ""SHAMEFUL"" DEAL Many of those competitor countries have corporate tax rates well above Ireland's current 12.5% and the incoming 15% global minimum. Dublin has long argued that it takes more than just low taxes to attract investment, pointing to Ireland's young, highly educated workforce and European Union membership. Announcing the opening of a new European headquarters in Dublin this week, U.S. online gifting platform Sendoso said corporate tax was a very small factor and that the global deal did not change Ireland's strategic advantages of as a location. The head of Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency said on Thursday that digital payments giant Stripe had never brought up tax when discussing rapid hiring plans in Ireland. The Irish sovereign wealth fund, which the NTMA manages, invested in the U.S. startup's latest funding round in March. Nevertheless, low tax countries could have suffered a far worse outcome. The United States, which led the recent charge to strike a deal, initially wanted a 21% minimum rate and the draft OECD agreement struck in July settled on ""at least 15%"". Dublin lobbied hard to remove the ""at least"". On succeeding, the government said it had maintained the stable business environment required to compete for investment. ""If we had a rate of 'at least' 15%, it would have created a lot of uncertainty about the attractiveness of our regime and that could have limited new investment and even a potential outflow of existing investment,"" said Peter Vale, a tax partner at Grant Thornton in Ireland. ""We played a strong hand and I think it's ended well."" The effective preservation of the status quo - albeit with multinationals coughing up more of their profits - has angered developing countries that see few gains. Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman said on Thursday the proposals forced developing countries to chose between ""something bad and something worse"". Argentina had reluctantly signed up to the previous version of the deal. ""It is shameful that the legitimate concerns of developing countries are being ignored while countries like low-tax Ireland are able to water down the already limited aspects of the deal,"" Oxfam's Tax Policy Lead Susana Ruiz said in a statement. ""The proposal for a fixed global rate of 15% will overwhelmingly benefit rich countries and increase inequality."" Ireland knows how long it takes to catch up. As recently as 1980, when Apple founder Steve Jobs arrived to open its first plant outside the United States, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a jobless rate heading towards 17%. ""We opened up the economy in the 1950s and prior to that we were probably inward-looking, protectionist and poor,"" IDA Ireland's Shanahan said, looking even further back. ""It takes a long time to build up the capability and the offering.""

business,"China digs in on coal, oil gains as energy crisis deepens"," Oct 8 (Reuters) - China ordered miners in Inner Mongolia to ramp up coal production and oil prices jumped on Friday as a record surge in the cost of gas revived demand for the most polluting fossil fuels to keep factories open and homes heated. The rebound in economic activity from coronavirus restrictions has exposed alarmingly low supplies of natural gas leaving traders, industry executives and governments scrambling  as the northern hemisphere heads into winter. The In China, where coal production had been curtailed to meet climate goals, officials have Russia's India, the second largest coal consumer after China, is also suffering Oil prices rose ""A lot of catalysts are out there to keep the oil market tight,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA. Reflecting the gravity of the situation, the United States has not ruled out tapping into its strategic petroleum reserves, which it typically only does after major supply disruptions such as hurricanes, or pursuing a ban on oil exports to bring down the cost of crude oil, though there are doubts it is ready to take such action yet. ""DOE is actively monitoring STOKING TENSIONS Global fuel shortages are another blow to a world economy just getting back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic and threaten an expensive winter for consumers. China is going to allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20% from base levels, instead of 10-15% previously, in order to prevent high energy consumption, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday, citing a meeting of the State Council, or cabinet. Bangladesh, meanwhile, bought two cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for delivery in October at record prices, two industry sources said on Friday, as low stocks in Europe boosts competition with Asia for supplies.

business,Britain calls on ex-Tesco boss 'Drastic Dave' to fix supply chain," LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Boris Johnson has turned to former Tesco Lewis, who was nicknamed ""Drastic Dave"" after fixing businesses at consumer goods group Unilever A post-Brexit shortage of workers, exacerbated by the global strains of the COVID-19 crisis, has hobbled Britain's supply chains for everything from fuel and pork to poultry and bottled water, putting any recovery from the pandemic under threat. After Johnson faced industry criticism for his response to the crisis, the appointment of the well-respected Lewis may be seen as an olive branch to the business community. The government said Lewis, who starts the role on Monday, will advise both Johnson and Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay on both immediate improvements and any necessary long-term changes to the country's supply chains for goods. He will also work with government officials to quickly resolve acute, short term issues. ""This includes both identifying the causes of current blockages and pre-empting potential future ones, and advising on resolutions either through direct government action or through industry with government support,"" the government added in a statement. Lewis will also work closely with Britain's finance ministry and co-chair the government's new Supply Chain Advisory Group, made up of external experts, and the new Industry Taskforce. ""There are currently global supply issues which we are working with industry to mitigate and Dave brings a wealth of experience which will help us continue to protect our businesses and supply chains,"" Johnson said. Tesco was on its knees shortly after Lewis joined in 2014 when an accounting scandal knocked millions of pounds off its profits and billions off its share price. He left in October last year, having declared Tesco's turnaround complete, with its position once again reinforced as the clear market leader among Britain's supermarkets. He was ennobled earlier this year. But not all retail gurus the British government has turned to in its hour of need have had such success. The then prime minister David Cameron in 2010 commissioned a report on cost savings in government by Philip Green. The BHS department store collapsed six years later, a year after Green sold it for a pound, leaving a yawning hole in its pension fund and some 11,000 job losses, prompting calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood.

business,U.S. airlines look for holiday boost after Delta variant interrupts recovery," BOSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are looking at the upcoming holiday season and the reopening of vital trans-Atlantic route to recover the momentum lost in the last quarter following a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. After a strong summer travel season, air-carriers had to temper their outlook last month for the quarter through September as the fast spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus slowed down new bookings and drove up cancellations. A month on, dipping COVID-19 cases have raised industry hopes that passengers would be more confident to fly again. Financial services firm Raymond James conducted an analysis of the Transportation Security Administration's 7-day average passenger screening data, which showed that while the travel demand still lags the peak in late July, it has improved from the lows in mid-September. ""Cancellations have abated, bookings are recovering,"" Chief Executive of Hawaiian Holdings Inc Bookings have also recovered at Delta Air Lines United Airlines ""There's a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Chief Executive Scott Kirby. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an consortium of 290 airlines, expects air-carriers in North America to return to profit next year before their counterparts in other geographies. BUSINESS TRAVEL The outlook for the industry's cash cow - business travel - remains uncertain. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, estimates business travel accounted for as much as 50% of airline industry passenger revenues before the pandemic. Carriers were banking on office reopenings for a revival in business trips this fall. But the Delta variant forced many large employers to push back their office openings into next year. Airlines say a revival is inevitable. However, there is no consensus on the timeline. United's Kirby expects business travel to rebound to the pre-pandemic levels in 2023, but JetBlue's The New York-based budget carrier has reallocated flights from some business markets into leisure markets, Hayes said. ""We continue to believe that...the holiday will be strong,"" Hayes told Reuters in an interview. ""That's certainly what we see in our forward bookings at the moment."" TRANS-ATLANTIC ROUTE REOPENING Airlines, meanwhile, are buoyed by the Biden administration's plan to reopen the United States in November to air travelers from Europe. The trans-Atlantic route is one of the most lucrative ones in the world and accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenues for the big three carriers. All the U.S. carriers, which serve the market, has seen a surge in the bookings since the White House made the announcement. Kirby said United's bookings for trans-Atlantic flights last week were above the same period in 2019. Sales have also jumped up at Delta Air and JetBlue. The reopening is not just an opportunity, but is also considered a big test for the industry. A successful reopening of the world's most important long-haul market is expected to set a trend for other markets to follow. However, a reimposition of the restrictions if COVID-19 cases start rising again could also slow the fragile recovery. ""Restrictions can't start reappearing where they have disappeared,"" said Hayes. ""It acts as a big dampener to demand."" Our Standards: Private business jets once provided refuge from airport waiting lines for the few that could afford them, but the fading pandemic has driven demand to such heights that even wealthy travelers now face cancellations and delays."
business,ECB governors expect friction with governments as end of support looms," STRBSKE PLESO, Slovakia, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank must think about the exit from monetary and fiscal support deployed during the coronavirus pandemic even if that displeases governments, three of its policymakers said on Friday. Belgium's central bank governor Pierre Wunsch, Slovakia's Peter Kazimir and Slovenia's Bostjan Vasle were discussing the end of the ECB's extraordinary stimulus measures, a decision on which is expected in December. ""Now the name of the game is exit,"" Wunsch said during a panel discussion with his two colleagues at an event in Slovakia. ""And the exit is going to be difficult because it's going to be about less, not more,"" he added. By pumping 1.4 trillion euros into the bond market since March 2020, the ECB's Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) has helped governments finance record deficits at ultra-low borrowing costs. But this bonanza was now nearing its end, the trio said. ""At the moment we're the finance ministers' best friends but that's not going to last forever,"" Kazimir said on the same panel. Slovenia's Vasle too said he saw ""potential for further tensions between central bankers and governments"" when the ECB normalises its policy. The ECB is widely expected to wind down PEPP in March 2022 but continue its smaller Asset Purchase Programme after that date, with the debate now focussing on how many bonds the ECB should continue to buy and for how long. ""I'm not in favour of doubling the bet each time if it doesn't work but I'm favour of being patient,"" Wunsch said. The ECB said in September it saw inflation at 2.2% this year, 1.7% the next and 1.5% in 2023. With prices likely to have risen by 3.4% in September, Wunsch said he thought the ECB's latest forecasts were too low and the central bank should not overemphasise the transitory aspect of the current inflation rise. ""I think inflation is going to be higher than in our last forecast,"" the Belgian governor said. ""But the argument that part of it is going to be temporary in nature is correct. Sometimes I have the impression that we focus too much on that."" He added he thought the ECB would reach its 2% inflation target sooner than expected. Markets price in some chances of a rate hike in December 2022 even if the ECB's forecasts imply a longer period of record-low borrowing costs. ""I think we should convey the message that hopefully our policy is going to work and bring inflation at some point to 2%,"" Wunsch said. ""I think it's going to take place faster than we thought six months ago.""

business,Canada posts massive jobs gain; employment back to pre-pandemic levels," OTTAWA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Canadian economy posted a monster jobs gain in September, pushing employment back to its pre-pandemic levels, and the jobless rate hit an 18-month low, Statistics Canada data indicated on Friday. Analysts said the figures showed the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining pace but predicted the Bank of Canada would want to see sustained evidence of strength before adopting a more aggressive stance on the timing of interest rate hikes. Statistics Canada reported a net gain of 157,100 new jobs, all of them in full-time employment. The jobless rate dipped to 6.9%, the lowest level since February 2020. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the country would add 65,000 new jobs in September and its unemployment rate would fall to 6.9% from 7.1% in August. Canada has now returned to the employment levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic started last year, having regained the 3 million jobs it lost during the crisis, Statscan said. ""It's very solid and shows that Canada is doing well in that fourth wave,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group, saying the central bank might announce later in October that it is further tapering its quantitative easing program. All the job gains came in full-time employment, which posted an increase of 193,600 new jobs, and were split evenly between the public and private sectors. The economy shed 36,500 part-time positions. The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.25% last year and says it will not consider raising them again until the economy has absorbed excess slack, which it expects to occur in the second half of 2022. Due to population growth, there are still 276,000 more people unemployed than there were in February 2020. ""The Bank of Canada is still going to want to see more improvement from here because their goal isn't just to get back to the pre-pandemic jobs number, it (is) to get back to the pre-pandemic employment population ratio,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. The Canadian dollar  touched its strongest level since Aug. 11 at 1.2490 per greenback, or 80.06 U.S. cents, up as much as 0.5% on the day. Separately, data showed U.S. employment increased far less than expected in September. Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, noted that while the number of hours worked were up 1.1%, they remained 1.5% below their pre-pandemic level. ""While the headline print likely seals the deal for another taper from the Bank of Canada later this month, there's still a ways to go to fully heal the labor market,"" he said in a note.

business,"Fewer U.S. workers sidelined by Delta variant in September even as cases peaked, survey shows"," Oct 8 (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers who were unable to work at some point over the previous four weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic fell in September, while more reported not looking for jobs because of those health concerns as the Delta variant of the coronavirus hit its summer peak, a Labor Department survey showed on Friday. Approximately 5.03 million people were unable to work in September or reported reduced hours due to their business either closing entirely or cutting back operations, down from roughly 5.65 million in the prior month, according to the survey. The August figure had been the first rise since last December. But the percentage of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 fears also rose slightly to 1.63 million from 1.52 million the prior month, highlighting the uneven nature of the jobs recovery. The statistics are derived from an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic. Overall, U.S. job growth increased far less than expected in September amid a decline in government payrolls, the main report showed, the second straight month of disappointing gains. ""The survey week is early September and that is where we were still having some pretty major concerns with the Delta variant,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey. Economists still widely expect the U.S. jobs recovery to accelerate again in the coming months. They cite declining COVID-19 case counts, less childcare constraints with the return of in-person schooling and the recent expiry of federal government-funded pandemic unemployment benefits. The benefits, which affected more than 6 million people, offered unemployment payments to people who did not qualify for the regular state jobless benefits, but were blamed by firms and Republicans for worker shortages. The number of people who said they teleworked recently due to the pandemic was largely unchanged last month, falling to 20.35 million from 20.56 million.

business,Better data needed for reform of EU trading rules-official," LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Poor trading data is hampering the European Union's capital market, ruling out any radical reform to securities rules before statistics have been improved, a senior official from the bloc said on Friday. Banks and stock exchanges are at loggerheads over changes being considered by Brussels to the EU's bond and stock trading rules, knowns as 'MiFID II'. Exchanges want a 15-minute delay in how their prices are published across markets in a planned ""consolidated tape"" of completed transactions, while asset managers and regulators want real-time publication. Bourses also want tougher rules on trading away from mainstream platforms but banks say such moves are unnecessary because most trading happens on exchanges. Banks say figures showing a large volume of trading happening off exchanges are swelled by 'technical' trades that have no influence on prices. ""Before we have a complete picture, we are not going to take overly radical decisions,"" Tilman Lueder, head of securities markets at the EU's executive, the European Commission, told an event held by European markets lobby AFME. Commission proposals to amend MiFID II are due before year end as the bloc seeks to deepen its capital market after Britain's exit last December. Lueder said retail investors, key to deepening the bloc's capital market, are ""third tier"" participants due to the lag in the prices they get, compared with deep-pocketed players who can afford real time prices. ""We need to get the retail more involved and the only way to do this is to give them information parity with the rest of the market,"" Lueder said. ""Our proposal will leave a lot of scope for private initiative, and lot of scope for people to register as a provider of a tape to get harmonised data, whether they want to provide this on a delayed basis or on a real time basis,"" Lueder said. ""I think we should leave the market also some opportunity to take some decisions here.""

business,Fed closes in on November bond taper after jobs report," Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may move to begin reducing its support for the economy next month despite a sharp slowdown in jobs gains last month as the latest U.S. surge in COVID-19 cases crested and began to recede. Though employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed, upward revisions to prior months' data meant that Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a ""decent"" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. ""I think it just barely clears Powell?�s hurdle of 'decent,'"" said Bank of the West economist Scott Anderson. ""A November taper announcement is still the most likely path for the Fed."" Others agreed. Kathy Lien, Managing Director, BK Asset Management, said the ""Federal Reserve made it very clear that they don?�t need a blockbuster jobs report to taper in November,"" and thought the central bank ""remains on track.??There was a muted market response with the benchmark S&P 500 flat in morning trading on Friday while the dollar was down less than 0.05%. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries, meanwhile, were higher at 1.6%. Some analysts said that the jobs report made the Fed's path ahead more complicated. ""The Fed was hoping for a number large enough so that their decision to begin tapering last month would be an easy one,"" said Northern Trust economist Carl Tannenbaum. ""Now, the discussions on November 2-3 may be more difficult; and the market will have to deal with some additional uncertainty."" The Fed has been buying $120 billion of Treasuries and housing-backed bonds each month since December to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, and had promised to keep doing so until there was ""substantial further progress"" toward its goals of 2% inflation and full employment. Since then the surge in demand as the economy reopened has pushed up prices. Ongoing supply bottlenecks look set to keep inflation well above 2% through the end of the year and into 2022, Fed forecasts and others suggest. On the labor market front, more of the deep hole punched in the labor market after the pandemic shutdowns is getting filled in. In December, the U.S. economy was supporting about 10 million fewer jobs than it had pre-pandemic; as of September, Friday's report shows, the gap was down to about 4.97 million. Once policymakers do begin to phase out their bond-buying program, it's unclear how quickly policymakers may then move to raise interest rates from their current near-zero level. Analysts at TD Securities said the weaker reading ""should temper some of the enthusiasm for 2022 rate hike pricing."" Futures on the federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations, on Friday priced in a quarter-point tightening by the Federal Reserve either by November or December next year, more or less the same before the release of the payrolls report. Fed policymakers have said they won't lift rates unless the economy reaches full employment, and inflation looks on track to stay above 2% for some time. One overarching question is whether COVID-19 cases stay on the wane as in recent weeks, or make a resurgence in the winter big enough spook consumers and wrongfoot the recovery. Another is the path of inflation, which Fed policymakers expect to subside next year but, if not, could force the central bank to make the uncomfortable decision to raise interest rates before the labor market is fully healed. And a third is the extent to which the labor market can make up lost ground. Fed policymakers in September had expected unemployment to fall to 4.8% by the end of this year, a benchmark that Friday's report showed it had already reached last month. Given the volatility in the number of workers opting to participate in the labor market, 'it isn't clear if this is going to 'stick,'"" Jefferies' economist Aneta Markowska wrote in a note. But to most analysts, and perhaps especially those with no love lost for a ballooning Fed balance sheet that's $8.5 trillion and counting, the path to taper is clearer than ever.

business,Moscow Exchange sues owner of rival SPB for not sharing market data," MOSCOW, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Russia's largest bourse, the Moscow Exchange SPB is hoping to raise $150 million in an IPO on its own bourse before the end of this year ahead of a larger U.S. listing in the first half of 2022, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. The Moscow Exchange said NP RTS, which owns 16.5% of SPB and distributes its market data, had not responded to multiple requests for the data to be shared. ""After unsuccessful attempts to obtain market data from NP RTS, the Moscow Exchange was forced to take extreme measures and file a lawsuit,"" the bourse said in a statement, after the Moscow Arbitration Court published documents concerning the case on Thursday. ""Unfortunately, today we see no other option for upholding our rights and the interests of Russian exchange market participants."" A hearing has been set for Oct. 28, the court documents showed. SPB Exchange said it was looking into the matter, but gave no further comment. SPB, which specialises in foreign securities, had a trading volume in September of $26.8 billion, up 47.8% year-on-year.

business,IMF chief Georgieva's lawyer claims data probe violated World Bank staff rules," WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Lawyers who investigated World Bank data-rigging allegations against IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva violated World Bank staff rules by failing to notify her that she was a subject of the probe and by not allowing her to respond to its findings, Georgieva's attorney said. In a The WilmerHale report alleged that while Georgieva was World Bank CEO in 2017, she applied ""undue pressure"" on World Bank staff to make data changes that boosted China's ranking at a time when the bank was seeking Beijing's support for a major capital increase. Georgieva has denied the allegations. The new claims from Breuer, a former U.S. Justice Department official and special counsel to former President Bill Clinton during his 1999 impeachment trial, come as Georgieva tries to persuade the IMF board to support her. The board interviewed both Georgieva and WilmerHale this week and will deliberate again on the matter on Friday. For its part, France plans to give its support to Georgieva at the board meeting, a French Finance Ministry source told Reuters on Friday. Georgieva on Wednesday called the accusations that she pressured staff to make inappropriate data changes ""outrageous and untrue"" and said some of her statements were taken out of context by WilmerHale. She ""Ms Georgieva has never been notified that she is a subject of the investigation, or been given an opportunity, as guaranteed by Staff Rule 3.00 to review and respond to the report's findings,"" wrote Breuer, her attorney. The The WilmerHale report said the initial part of its investigation focused on board officials pursuant to the Code of Conduct for Board Officials, a different set of rules than the staff rule referenced by Breuer. ""We conducted our investigation following all applicable World Bank rules,"" the WilmerHale firm said in an emailed statement. ""Dr. Georgieva was notified that our report would be presented to the World Bank Board, and that the World Bank could disclose any information she provided."" According to a July email from WilmerHale to Georgieva reviewed by Reuters, a WilmerHale partner said the firm was conducting its review into Doing Business data irregularities and staff misconduct authorized by and pursuant to World Bank Staff Rule 3.00.

business,"U.S. bond funds see lowest weekly inflow in 2-1/2 months on inflation fears, Lipper says"," Oct 8 (Reuters) - Money inflows into U.S. bond funds dropped in the week to Oct. 6 as a surge in energy prices drove inflationary pressures, with worries over the U.S. debt ceiling capping inflows for shorter-term bonds. Investors purchased a net $727 million in U.S. bond funds in the week to Oct. 6, which was their lowest weekly inflow since July 21, Lipper data showed. Yields on the shorter-term bonds climbed during the week on fears that the U.S. Treasury might run out of cash, potentially leading to a default without a debt ceiling increase or suspension. However, the U.S. Senate approved legislation on Thursday to temporarily raise the federal government's $28.4 trillion debt limit and avoid the risk of a historic default this month. U.S. government bond funds saw a second straight week of outflows, worth $483 million, while, municipal debt funds attracted $988 million in net buying. Inflation-protected bond funds also received $1.28 billion, the highest inflow since the end of July. U.S. equity funds received inflows of $2.85 billion, after two straight weeks of outflows. Investors bought $1.17 billion in equity value funds after two straight weeks of sales, while growth funds faced outflows for a third consecutive week, worth $882 million. Among sector funds, technology and financials attracted $785 million and $502 million, respectively, while healthcare funds marked a second subsequent outflow worth $1.93 billion.

business,Tata regains control of troubled Air India with $2.4 bln bid," NEW DELHI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Tata Sons will resume control of Air India after bidding $2.4 billion, including equity and debt, the government said on Friday, marking the end of years of struggle to privatise the financially troubled airline. A successful sale of the loss-making national flag carrier will be a major victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it had cost tax payers an average of nearly $3 million a day for the past decade. It would also bode well for planned stake sales in a slew of state-run firms to bolster government coffers and make India a fully market-driven economy. Talace Pvt Ltd, a unit of Tata Sons - the holding company for the autos-to-steel Tata conglomerate which owns luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover - will acquire 100% of Air India, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, said. The deal, which is expected to be finalised by the end of the year, puts Air India back in the hands of the group which founded it as Tata Airlines in 1932 before it was nationalised in 1953. The bid amount includes Tata taking on $2 billion of Air India's $8.2 billion total debt, resulting in an equity value for the government of only about $400 million. Tata currently operates two airlines - Vistara, India's only other full-service carrier, in a venture with Singapore Airlines Adding Air India will give Tata a combined share of about 27% of the country's domestic aviation market, second only to IndiGo. Family scion and emeritus chairman of Tata Sons, Ratan Tata said on Twitter that while it will take ""considerable effort"" to rebuild Air India's reputation, it would provide Tata with a strong opportunity in the aviation industry. ""Welcome back, Air India!,"" he said in a tweet. The acquisition will give Tata an additional 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international slots at Indian airports annually, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas, the most lucrative of which are at London's Heathrow. ""Air India provides a unique and attractive international footprint,"" Tata Sons said in a statement, adding that more than two-thirds of its revenue comes from international markets like North America, Europe and the Middle East. Tata will gain 8,000 full-time employees, which it must retain for at least one year under the terms of the deal, and some 120 planes, mostly older narrowbody Airbus It will also become the sole owner of Air India's low-cost arm, Air India Express, likely giving the group a competitive advantage, said Suman Chowdhury, chief analytical officer at Mumbai-based Acuité Ratings & Research. ""However, the ability to optimise costs, and streamline operations will be a formidable challenge and the key to profitability,"" he said. It has taken the Modi administration more than four years to find a buyer for Air India. The latest push began in January 2020, just weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic brought the global airline industry to its knees. Over the past decade, the government has spent about $15 billion of taxpayer money on Air India, famous for its Maharaja mascot, Pandey said, adding that the deal will plug the outflow of bailout funds. Our Standards: The sale of national carrier Air India to conglomerate Tatas has opened the way for faster privatisation of state firms and the government is on track to list Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) early next year, a top government official said on Tuesday."

Potential investors face a qualifying phase in which they must commit to providing 125% or more of the initial capital expenditure, which Aena estimated at 107 million euros ($124 million), in exchange for a majority stake in a joint venture. Bidders have until Nov. 7 to present their documentation, with the plot of land known as Area 1 expected to be auctioned in the first quarter of 2022, and state-owned Aena set to retain a minority stake in the newly-formed company. Aena said in a statement it will lease Area 1, which will combine 153,000 square metres of developed area and 4 hectares of land reserved for green spaces, to its majority partner for a period of 75 years. Airport City will offer investors 2.1 million square metres of buildable space overall, dedicated to cross-docking, storage and logistics warehouses and providers of associated aviation services, as well as offices, hotels and parks. The company on Thursday also signed a 30-year lease with Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) to use two logistics plots in Madrid-Barajas airport's Air Cargo Poligon - an area separate to the yet-to-be-built Airport City. WFS will pay 2 million euros per year to use around 12,200 square metres for air-freight activities including merchandise storage and handling, Aena said in a statement, some 360% above the expected value.

business,"Chip crisis hits Stellantis' Italy output more than COVID did, union says"," MILAN, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The impact from a global semiconductor shortage on Stellantis' A global microchip shortage is pushing automakers to slow down production, with Stellantis halting operations at several facilities across Europe and the United States. The carmaker forecast it would make 1.4 million fewer vehicles this year. ""The semiconductor hurricane is causing production stoppages that are weighing more than the lockdown in 2020,"" FIM-CISL head Ferdinando Uliano said. ""The forecasts are that such situation will carry on for the whole first half of 2022"". FIM-CISL said Stellantis had produced 319,000 cars in Italy in the first nine month of this year, 11% more than in the same period of 2020, when operations where frozen for several weeks following the COVID-19 outbreak. But Uliano said 2021 full year production would hardly match the 461,000 units produced last year. ""It's practically impossible, the chip situation is getting more serious and we'll have further heavy closures,"" he said, adding a similar situation was expected with van production at the Sevel plant in central Italy. Stellantis, formed earlier this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, will operate the Melfi plant, its largest Italian facility, for an equivalent of only six days in October. On the other hand, Turin's Mirafiori, where the electric 500 small car is produced, is among the few plants which have not suffered major stoppages. ""Production of the BEV 500 must go on to meet targets on carbon emission reduction,"" Uliano said. The world's fourth largest carmaker has also decided to close one German plant until the end of the year. ""The main risk is that Stellantis decides to delay planned investments and new model launches, as the chip crisis pushes sales down,"" Uliano said. The carmaker will present Maserati's Grecale SUV next month, followed by Alfa Romeo Tonale SUV, with sale due from June 2022. Italian unions will meet Stellantis on Monday at Italy's Industry Ministry to discuss production and jobs in the country.

Czech company Eurowag Many companies that listed earlier in the year are trading below their IPO price, with the FTSE Renaissance IPO Index for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region down 9.19% so far this year. ""Fear of inflation and rising interest rates, as well as uncertainty around China, have made many investors more cautious,"" said Christoph Lang, head of core equities in Europe for J.

Uncertainty over the fate of heavily indebted Chinese property company Evergrande ""We've had something of a buyers' strike, which is not a phrase I've had to use for a while,"" said one senior banker who manages IPOs in Europe, preferring to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to speak about his clients.

business,U.S. job growth seen picking up after Delta setback," WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. job growth likely accelerated in September as the summer wave of COVID-19 infections began to subside, fueling demand for high-contact services like dining out, and positioning the Federal Reserve to start scaling back its monthly bond buying. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday would also suggest that an apparent sharp slowdown in economic activity in the third quarter was probably temporary. Still, the labor market and broader economy remain constrained by worker and raw material shortages, wrought by the pandemic. ""With COVID clearly on a downward path again, I think the jobs report should be pretty good,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""But there are still clearly strains in the job market, in that the labor supply story remains very constrained."" According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely surged by 500,000 jobs last month, which would leave the level of employment about 4.8 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000. The economy added 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months, with hiring in the leisure and hospitality industry stalling. Apart from the Delta variant, a seasonal quirk was also a drag, and economists expect August payrolls will be revised higher in keeping with the trend in past years. COVID-19 infections are decreasing in the United States, with 100,815 new infections reported on average each day, according to Reuters analysis of data from state and local governments, as well as health authorities. September's employment report is the only one available before the Fed's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank signaled last month that it could start tapering its monthly bond buying as soon as November. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that ""it would take a reasonably good employment report"" to meet the central bank's threshold for reducing its massive bond buying program. Economists expect that criteria will be met in the September report, which is also expected to show the unemployment rate falling to 5.1% from 5.2% in August. The likelihood of a taper was bolstered by the U.S. Senate taking a step on Thursday to raise the Treasury Department's borrowing authority until December. ""Virtually any payroll gain in excess of August's 235,000 increase would check this particular box for the Fed,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in New York. SPEED BUMP Labor market indicators were mixed in September. The ADP National employment report on Wednesday showed stronger-than-expected private payrolls growth last month. The number of people on state unemployment rolls decreased between mid-August and mid-September. But a survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. While the Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month, its measure of services industry employment slipped. The economy hit a speed bump in the third quarter in part because of the summer flare up in coronavirus cases, an ebb in the flow of pandemic relief money from the government and scarce raw materials, which have hammered motor vehicle sales. The Atlanta Fed estimates that gross domestic product growth braked to a 1.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. The leisure and hospitality sector likely led the anticipated pick up in hiring last month, reflecting a rebound in payrolls at restaurants and bars, which fell by 42,000 jobs in August. A rebound in hiring at retailers is expected as businesses gear up for the holiday season. Manufacturing employment probably slowed, likely constrained by input shortages, especially semiconductors. General Motors Government payrolls likely rebounded as schools fully reopened for in-person learning. There is cautious optimism that the return to classrooms boosted the share of women in the labor force. Economists will also be watching the proportion of the work age population in the labor force for signs whether worker shortages were starting to ease. Federal government-funded benefits expired in early September, affecting more than 6 million people. The expanded benefits, which offered unemployment checks to people who did not qualify for the regular state jobless benefits, were blamed by businesses and Republicans for the worker shortage. There were a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July. But many unemployed appeared to have stashed away some of the money from the government, and are therefore in no hurry to start looking for jobs. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, has barely budged even as about 25 states led by Republican governors terminated the expanded benefits this summer. Some economists say a significant portion of people who dropped out of the labor force have retired, thanks to a strong stock market and record house price gains, which boosted household wealth. Self employment has also increased. ""The current labor shortage will ease considerably this fall, especially following the expiration of federal benefits programs in September, but we still project an over one million hit to the labor force from early retirees and other labor force exits at end-2022,"" said Joseph Briggs, an economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. Our Standards: The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives is expected on Tuesday to give final approval to a Senate-passed bill temporarily raising the government's borrowing limit to $28.9 trillion, putting off the risk of default until early December."
business,Explainer: Bleak house: Why Europe faces steep winter energy bills," LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Households across Europe face much higher winter energy bills due to a global surge in wholesale power and gas prices and consumer groups have warned the most vulnerable in the region could be hit by fuel poverty as a result. WHY THE HIGH PRICES? Energy companies pay a wholesale price to buy gas and electricity, which they then sell to consumers. As in any market, this can go up or down, driven by supply and demand. Prices typically rise in response to more demand for heating and people turning lights on earlier in winter, while those in the summer period are usually lower. But prices have sky-rocketed due to low gas storage stocks, high European Union carbon prices, low liquefied natural gas tanker deliveries due to higher demand from Asia, less gas supplies from Russia than usual, low renewable output and infrastructure outages. Benchmark European gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub  have risen by more than 400% since January, while benchmark German and French power contracts have more than doubled. HOW LONG COULD THIS LAST? Europe's winter heating season typically begins in October and wholesale prices are not forecast to fall significantly during the remainder of this year, despite promises from some suppliers of more gas. Many analysts expect prices to remain elevated next year. Russia, Europe's largest gas supplier, said this week that the certification of the Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which expects clearance from a German regulator, could cool soaring European gas prices. The regulator, which said in September it had four months to complete certification, said it could not rule out that Nord Stream 2 operations could start soon, adding that all technical requirements had been met. But Gazprom's ability to supply more volumes to Europe could be limited this winter as it is still filling its own domestic gas storages and already producing close to a 10-year high, said analysts at Bank of America. Last month, Norway's Equninor EQNR.OL, Europe's second largest supplier, said it would increase natural gas exports to Europe. Norway supplies just under a third of Britain's gas. WHY RETAIL PRICE RISES? Many energy suppliers announced hikes to retail tariffs in recent months, passing a higher wholesale cost on to consumers. Wholesale costs can make up a large chunk of a bill. In Britain, for example, on a dual fuel bill (electricity and gas), the wholesale cost can account for 40% of the total. So when wholesale market prices rise significantly, suppliers can hike consumer retail tariffs. Suppliers can buy energy in the wholesale market on the day of delivery, a day ahead and up to months or seasons in advance. They have to try and predict when the price will be cheaper and buy the right amount to cover their customer needs. If suppliers do not buy enough energy, they might have to buy more at a price which could be higher, depending on market movements. This year, prices have kept on climbing all summer. CAN ANYONE INTERVENE? European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has said she would soon present a plan to overhaul the EU gas market. One of the ideas, proposed by Spain, is for the EU to buy gas jointly to take advantage of the power of its single market of 450 million consumers and create a strategic EU gas reserve but details are scant on how that would work. Some national governments have announced measures to try and ease the winter burden on households, such as subsidies, price caps or redirecting energy company profits to consumers. Britain, which relies heavily on gas for heating, introduced a price cap on the most widely used energy tariffs in 2019 aimed at ending what former Prime Minister Theresa May called ""rip-off"" pricing. However, Britain's energy regulator Ofgem has raised the cap on the most widely used tariffs, called standard variable tariffs, by 12-13% from October. It said on Friday it expects a ""significant"" rise of the cap again next April. Proposals for UK government intervention have included state loans and the creation of a ""bad bank"" to support energy suppliers, as well as a windfall tax to help ease the burden on household bills. ""It is, however, unclear how any of such proposals could be implemented and what their impact on the industry would be,"" said Moody's Investor Service. WHAT CAN CONSUMERS DO? Due to a deregulated market, Britain has had some of the biggest choice in energy suppliers for consumers. In a market of now around 40 suppliers, smaller firms have less capital to hedge their wholesale power purchases against soaring prices and nine firms serving over 1.7 million customers, or 6% of the market, have ceased trading since the beginning of September. Consumers are usually encouraged to switch providers or to a cheaper tariff. However, consumer groups in Britain now say standard variable tariffs, subject to the price cap, are among the cheapest as smaller suppliers fail and there are no longer cheaper deals available. ""But the cap level isn't the maximum anyone will pay. The price cap sets a limit on the rates you pay for each unit of gas and electricity, so if you use more, you'll pay more,"" said Andrew Capstick, energy analyst at price comarison website moneysupermarket.com Regulators such as Britain's Ofgem urge consumers to contact their energy provider if they are struggling to pay their bills to explain when and how much can be paid. Energy efficiency measures, such as improved insulation, energy efficient lighting and smart meters are also advised, but could require upfront costs. Reducing energy usage is much easier in the summer months. Our Standards: Oil prices steadied after whipsawing in a volatile sessionon Tuesday, as traders weighed the effect that higher energy costs could have on the global economic recovery."

business,Marketmind: Kick that can," A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao All's well. At least until December 3 when the U.S. Treasury will again bump up against the newly raised debt ceiling, allowing Congress to put markets through the 'will-they, won't they' agony yet again. And European gas prices are now around a third off peaks hit earlier this week, though they still are up some 300% on the year. Still, it's enough to put markets in a better mood -- world stocks enjoyed their biggest daily bounce on Thursday since May while 10-year Treasury yields soared on Friday to 1.6%, four-month highs. Chinese shares rose too as Caixin PMIs showed an expansion in September services activity (after an August dip). The gains rippled into the commodity complex and commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar too, though the momentum is starting to fizzle now with Wall Street looking set for a flat open and European futures a touch lower. All eyes now turn to the 1230 GMT release of the U.S. payrolls data, which a Reuters poll predicted will show 500,000 jobs added in September Remember what Fed boss Jerome Powell said last month -- that he didn't need ""a knockout great super-strong employment report"" to feel that conditions had been met to taper stimulus. Chances are the data won't do much to knock the Fed off its tapering course. There are obviously other issues clouding the outlook. Gas prices may be down but oil continues to climb with Brent now almost $83 a barrel. At what point does it start to impact world growth? Then there's the Evergrande saga, which on Friday again hit bonds and shares of Chinese property firms Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: - Eurowag sets listing price below range as it makes London debut - ECB board member Fabio Panetta speaks at BoE event. - China Sept services activity returns to growth. - India cenbank keeps rates on hold. - Rising chip prices fuel Samsung's best quarterly profit in 3 years. - Insurer Chubb to acquire Cigna's Asian, Turkish business for $5.8 bln. - Ireland agrees to global tax deal. - German exports slip for first time in 15 months.

business,Corteva faces slow start as it takes aim at Bayer's Brazil soy reign," SAO PAULO, Oct 8  (Reuters) - U.S. pesticide and seed maker Corteva Inc Corteva is launching new genetically modified (GMO) soy seeds in top soybean grower Brazil, where rival Bayer AG Brazil's adoption of genetically modified crops helped it become the world's biggest seller of soy used for livestock feed. But weeds and pests have become resistant to the chemicals those crops can withstand. So Bayer and Corteva are each striving to convert Brazilian growers to their next-generation GMO seed varieties that can tolerate newer herbicides. At stake are billions of dollars in annual sales of seeds and herbicides to the important Brazilian market. Moreover, the seeds that Brazil's farmers choose, by playing a role in the size of their harvests, will influence world supply and prices for commodities that many countries rely on to feed their people and livestock. Soybeans are already scarce and prices are at a seven-year high. Bayer and Corteva do not produce seeds themselves in Brazil. Rather, local genetic improvement companies tailor new varieties for the local market to address local soil and climate conditions -- a process that can take years. Then, seedmakers mass produce seeds to sell to farmers for planting. ""The adoption of the Enlist system in Brazil will take a little longer than in the United States,"" Corteva said in an e-mail to Reuters, because seed quantity in Brazil is limited. The company had ample Enlist E3 seeds, the GMO technology that quickly took off in the United States, available for U.S. farmers in 2019 when Enlist received U.S. regulatory approvals. Corteva, spun off in 2019 after a merger of Dow Chemical and Dupont, captured 35% of U.S. soy-planted area with Enlist in three years. In Brazil, Corteva estimated it will take five to 10 years to reach that level. Corteva is also launching a more expensive soybean seed in Brazil called Conkesta E3, but Enlist is its primary focus in the campaign to win market share from Bayer. BAYER EDGE Bayer's long dominance in Brazil's seed market gives it an edge as it introduces a new product in Brazil at the same time as Enlist and Conkesta are entering the market. Bayer acquired seedmaker Monsanto in 2016 and inherited Monsanto's seed and chemical empire. Monsanto launched the Intacta RR2 Pro soybean seed technology in Brazil seven years ago. In the 2020/2021 cycle, 80% of Brazilian soy was grown with Intacta. This year Bayer is launching its Intacta2 Xtend seed line in Brazil that resists the herbicide dicamba - a chemical Bayer is betting on globally as crops grow resistant to its earlier herbicide glyphosate. Bayer said in an e-mail more than 30 seed varieties had been developed using its Intacta2 Xtend technology for the Brazilian market. That gives it an advantage over Corteva's Enlist, which has not yet been adapted to the Brazilian market by local genetic seed companies. Even so, at least one factor may work in Corteva's favor. Dicamba is the target of U.S. lawsuits and a U.S. government review because of its tendency to drift away from where it is sprayed and damage crops on neighboring farms. Bayer agreed to pay up to $400 million to resolve lawsuits by U.S. landowners who said their crops were damaged by neighbors spraying dicamba. Problems with dicamba encouraged U.S. farmers to turn to Corteva's Enlist products, and Brazilian farmers have followed the U.S. experience with dicamba closely. ""I will not buy the herbicide (dicamba),"" said Eduardo Godoi, a farmer in Brazil's top soy growing state of Mato Grosso who will try Intacta2 Xtend for the first time. Our Standards: The world's multilateral development banks need to ""up their ambition"" in terms of the financing provided for climate-related projects, United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney said on Tuesday."
business,Japan wholesale inflation likely hit 13-year high in Sept on rising commodity costs: Reuters poll," TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale prices likely hit a 13-year high in September, buoyed by lofty commodity prices, while firms' machinery orders are expected to have risen for the second straight month in August, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which tracks the prices companies charge one another for their goods, likely rose 5.9% in September from a year ago, according to a poll of 17 economists. That would be its highest annual price gain since September 2008. The index grew 5.5% year-on-year in August. On a monthly basis, Japan's wholesale prices likely grew 0.3% in September after being flat the previous month, the poll showed. ""Commodity inflation will affect prices of petroleum products, chemical, steel and other metals, which results in a higher growth"" in wholesale inflation, said Shunpei Fujita, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting. ""But as the growth in commodity prices slows, corporate goods inflation in Japan will gradually cool down."" Commodity prices have rallied recently amid energy supply worries, stoking concerns about global inflation. But with Japan's main inflation gauge still well below target at 0.0% in August, the Bank of Japan is expected to stick to massive monetary stimulus for the foreseeable future The Bank of Japan will release the CGPI data on Tuesday at 8:50 a.m. (Monday at 2350 GMT). On Wednesday, the government is due to release core machinery orders data. Core machinery orders are expected to have risen 1.7% in August from the previous month, according to the Reuters poll, after 0.9% growth in July. Orders likely rose amid solid capital expenditure among companies preparing for a reopening of the economy after the government lifted state of emergency curbs at the end of September. Japan's economic recovery has been led by robust demand for its exports, offsetting the weakness in COVID-hit consumption. But the manufacturing sector is now facing renewed pressure from supply chain disruptions. Industrial output fell for the second straight month in August as COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere in Asia shut factories and made it harder for carmakers, already grappling with a global chip shortage, to source parts.

business,Global money market funds attract big inflows on inflation concerns -Lipper," Oct 8 (Reuters) - Global money market funds saw huge inflows in the week to Oct. 6, as investors favoured safety amid concerns over higher inflation, supply shortages and distress in the China property sector. According to data from Lipper, investors purchased a net $13.95 billion in global money market funds in the week, compared with net selling of $21.85 billion in the previous week. Oil prices touched multi-year highs this week, stoking concerns that inflation levels will rise further, which could prompt major central banks to hike interest rates earlier than expected. Global equity funds attracted a net $6.4 billion worth of inflows, with Asia accounting for a major share of the purchases. Asian equity funds obtained $4.03 billion, while U.S. and European equity funds secured $2.85  billion and $1.2 billion respectively. Japanese equity funds received a net $3.22 billion, the biggest weekly inflow since September 2020. Among sector funds, financials and technology funds received a net $959 million and $780 million respectively, each marking a second straight weekly inflow, while health care funds saw outflows of $1.75 billion. Global bond funds received inflows of $3.78 billion, down 43% from the previous week. But global inflation protected funds secured $1.82 billion, the biggest since end July, though corporate bond funds faced an outflow of $1.54 billion. Among commodity funds, energy funds saw outflows of $275 million after small inflows in the previous week, while precious metals funds faced outflows of a net $188 million.

business,UK consumer confidence slides as inflation worry mounts: Bank of America," LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - British consumer morale has fallen to its lowest since February, when the country was under heavy COVID-19 restrictions, due to worries about the economic outlook and about rising prices, a Bank of America report showed on Friday. The survey chimed with other gauges of consumer confidence in Britain that have suggested a growing cost-of-living squeeze has started to drag on the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The readings follow disarray in Britain in recent days as a shortage of truckers left fuel pumps dry across much of the country and a spike in European wholesale natural gas prices raised the prospect of a surge in utility bills. ""Our proprietary UK consumer confidence indicator continued to drop over the past two weeks, reaching the lowest since February on our 7-day moving average,"" Bank of America economist Robert Wood said in a note to clients. The survey showed inflation expectations rose by 60 basis points from August, with almost a third of Britons now expecting inflation above 5% in five years' time. Bank of England officials are trying to gauge whether higher inflation expectations pose a risk to its 2% inflation target over the medium term. Some policymakers are concerned that investors and consumers could lose confidence in the central bank's ability to contain inflation, raising the prospect of higher interest rates even as the economy is slowing. Earlier on Friday, a separate survey showed British employers increased pay for new staff by the most since at least the 1990s. But the Bank of America data showed little sign of a damaging 1970s-style wage-price spiral. Expectations for pay growth in the BofA survey showed little sign of change and remained close to pre-pandemic norms. Our Standards: British employers increased their payrolls to a record high in September, shortly before the end of the government's wage subsidies scheme, potentially encouraging the Bank of England's progress towards a first post-pandemic interest rate hike."
business,Dollar steady after jobs miss as investors bet taper is on track," NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was little moved by a disappointing U.S. employment report on Friday, as traders bet that the numbers will not sway the Federal reserve from starting a tapering of its asset purchases as early as November. The Labor Department said in its employment report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 500,000 jobs. The fact that the gain was modest could temper expectations for a swift acceleration in economic growth following an apparent sharp slowdown in the third quarter, but is unlikely to stop the Federal Reserve from starting the process of reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November, analysts said. September's employment report is the last one available before the Federal Reserve's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting. ""(It's a) miss on the headline number for sure, but the underlying details are not as really nefarious as the top-line miss would suggest and so, ultimately, it?�s still consistent with the Fed delivering taper next month,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities in New York. The dollar index , which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was down 0.1% at 94.067, not far from the one-year high of 94.504 touched last week. ""I think that the Federal Reserve made it very clear that they don?�t need a blockbuster jobs report to taper in November, so while you?�re seeing a little bit of a pullback in the dollar, I think the Fed remains on track,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. TD's Issa said the disappointing jobs number could lead to a dip in the dollar but any such weakness was likely to be fleeting. ""I think the market is going to need a lot more convincing that just one jobs report that?�s on the softer side is going to price the Fed out beyond late 2022 and into 2023,"" Issa said. In the week following jobs data the dollar tends to reverse most of the gain or loss that has occurred from the day of the NFP release, FX strategists said in a BofA Global Research report on Thursday. The weaker dollar helped sterling steady on Friday, putting it on track to close out the week up 0.6%, its best weekly performance in 5 weeks, as interest rate hike expectations offset worries about a fuel crisis and labour shortages. In the digital currency space, bitcoin , the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value, was 1.5% higher at $54,569.9, just shy of the 5-month high of $56,168 touched earlier in the session. Bitcoin is up about 13% for the week, its second straight weekly gain.

business,"U.S. Senate approves temporary lift of debt ceiling, averts default"," WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate approved legislation on Thursday to temporarily raise the federal government's $28.4 trillion debt limit and avoid the risk of a historic default this month, but put off until early December a decision on a longer-lasting remedy. The Senate voted 50-48 to pass the bill following weeks of partisan fighting. Earlier, 11 Republicans voted in favor of a procedural vote allowing the bill to proceed. The Senate-passed bill now goes to the House of Representatives, which needs to approve it before President Joe Biden can sign it into law. The House will hold a vote on the bill on Tuesday, according to the office of the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer. ""President Biden looks forward to signing this bill as soon as it passes the House and reaches his desk,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in statement on Thursday. ""As we approach the coming months, we hope that even more Republicans will join Democrats in responsibly addressing the debt limit instead of choosing default or obstruction."" The $480 billion increase, which would lift the debt limit to $28.9 trillion, is expected to be exhausted by Dec. 3, the same day that funding for most federal programs  expires under a stop-gap measure passed earlier this month following another partisan standoff. That means that over the next eight weeks, the bitterly divided Congress will have the twin challenges of finding a middle ground on agency spending through September 2022 -- ranging from education and foreign aid programs to immigration enforcement and airport security -- and avoiding yet another debt limit meltdown. The vote followed a months-long standoff that brought the nation close to the Oct. 18 date that the Treasury Department forecast as when it would no longer be able to meet its obligations. ""Republicans played a dangerous and risky partisan game and I am glad that their brinksmanship did not work,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. The plan emerged on Wednesday after top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Republicans were open to a temporary hike after twice blocking Democrats' attempts to raise the cap. That offer came after Biden raised the possibility of bypassing the Senate's filibuster rule requiring 60 of the 100 members to agree on most legislation. Not all Republicans were happy with McConnell's move, and it took long negotiations behind closed doors to secure enough Republican votes to advance the measure. ""This is a complete capitulation,"" said Republican Lindsey Graham. Earlier in the day, news of the negotiations drove Wall Street's main stock indexes to end sharply higher in a broad-based rally. In a sign of bond market relief, the yield on one-month Treasury bills fell to the lowest point since Sept. 8 as investors deemed that the risk of default had eased. RECONCILIATION Washington's debt limit troubles are unlikely to be resolved with passage of the short-term increase. McConnell is still expected to insist that the next increase in December be achieved through the time-consuming ""budget reconciliation"" process, which would allow for passage without any votes from his party. Doing so could bolster Republican candidates in the 2022 congressional elections as they try to burnish their credentials as fiscal conservatives - even though most of them previously supported an array of measures passed during Republican Donald Trump's administration that jacked up U.S. budget deficits. Democrats have adamantly rejected using the reconciliation process, although they have used it to pass some of Biden's other priorities, saying that in this case it is too unwieldy and would establish a bad precedent. Referring to the deal providing a debt limit reprieve until December, McConnell said in a Senate speech: ""Now there will be no question. They'll (Democrats) have plenty of time"" to pass the next increase using reconciliation. Democrats had been trying to pass legislation that would have raised the debt limit through the end of 2022, which Republicans blocked. While the deal relieves debt ceiling pressures for now, it adds to the high-stakes, partisan battles Congress will wage through the end of the year. Democrats want to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of Biden's domestic agenda in the coming weeks, including a multi-trillion-dollar social policy package to be passed by reconciliation and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. But by late November, their attention will have to return to funding the government and again avoiding the debt ceiling. Our Standards: The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives is expected on Tuesday to give final approval to a Senate-passed bill temporarily raising the government's borrowing limit to $28.9 trillion, putting off the risk of default until early December."
business,"Yields rise, stocks waver after U.S. jobs data"," NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Global equity markets wavered on Friday on a weak U.S. labor market report, and Treasury yields rose as investors still expect the Federal Reserve to begin tapering its massive bond purchases as early as next month. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed above 1.6% for the first time since June, the dollar eased and stocks on Wall Street slid as technology and other high-growth shares sold off while energy and financials gained. The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September amid a drop in hiring at schools and worker shortages. The unemployment rate dropped to an 18-month low of 4.8%. ""The headline weakness hides an otherwise much stronger job market than we're currently seeing,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.

""While you're seeing a little bit of a pullback in the dollar, I think the Fed remains on track,"" she said. The dollar index , which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.076% to 94.105. The euro  was up 0.19% at $1.1572, while the Japanese yen  traded up 0.56% at $112.2200. The sideways market is due to an information vacuum before the third-quarter earnings season starts next week, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC. ""The last few weeks there's some uncertainty with Delta, so the market is really looking forward to estimates,"" Hayes said. Global stock indexes turned positive for the week after Thursday's rally despite widespread selling initially as soaring energy prices and the prospect of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes to combat inflation rattled investors. The U.S. Senate's approval of legislation to raise the federal government's debt limit and avoid a historic default buoyed risk sentiment, though it only put off a decision on a longer-term remedy until early December.

business,"Congo's $6 bln China mining deal 'unconscionable', says draft report"," DAKAR, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo should renegotiate its $6 billion infrastructure-for-minerals deal with Chinese investors, according to the draft of a report commissioned by a global anti-corruption body of governments, companies and activists. The draft, seen by Reuters, describes the deal that was first signed in 2008 as ""unconscionable"" and urges Congo's government to cancel an amendment signed secretly in 2017 that sped up payments to Chinese mining investors and slowed reimbursements of investment in infrastructure. The final report is expected to be released this month by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which tracks revenue flows in the oil and mining sectors and counts more than 50 countries, including Congo, as members. The report has no legal force but, if the draft's main conclusions remain, it could bolster Congo's push to secure more favourable terms from mining contracts with Chinese investors. President Felix Tshisekedi's government is reviewing the 2008 contract and the reserve levels at China Molybdenum's Prime Minister Sama Lukonde Kyenge told a mining conference on Thursday: ""There has to be some adjustment."" The moves represent rare pushback by Congo, the world's leading producer of the battery metal cobalt and Africa's top copper miner, against the Chinese investors who control most of its mining industry. Under the 2008 deal struck with the government of former President Joseph Kabila, Chinese state-owned firms Sinohydro Corp (SINOH.UL) and China Railway Group Limited agreed to build roads and hospitals financed by profits from Congo's Sicomines cobalt and copper joint venture. Critics say few of those projects have been realised. Congo's government spokesman said he had not read the draft and could not comment. EITI's office in Congo referred Reuters to the terms of reference of the mission and declined to comment further. A Sicomines representative did not respond to requests for comment. China Railway had no immediate comment. Sinohydro did not respond to a request for comment. Fred Zhang, a senior Sicomines official, defended the deal in comments to Reuters last week, saying it had driven development for Congo's people and Sicomines would disburse more funds as production rose. 'DENUNCIATION' The draft, written by two Congolese consultants, recommends ""the denunciation by the Congolese state of the unconscionable character of the joint-venture convention of April 22, 2008 and the return to the negotiations table by Sicomines shareholders"". It says the Chinese companies' 68% stake in Sicomines is too high since the Congolese contributed all the mining assets and 32% of the initial capital. It condemns the previously undisclosed 2017 amendment. Under the 2008 contract, all of Sicomines' profits would initially go to reimbursing investments in Congo's most urgent infrastructure projects. It was on that basis that parliament agreed to exempt Sicomines from all taxes, the draft says. Under the 2017 amendment, seen by Reuters, only 65% of Sicomines' profits must initially go toward reimbursing the investments while 35% goes to shareholders. The change could further slow the pace of the infrastructure projects, the draft says. To date, less than $1 billion of the expected $3 billion has been invested, about $1 billion less than projected at this stage, it says. ""This amendment constitutes a violation of the security of the interests of the Republic,"" the draft says. The draft report calls for re-evaluating Sicomines' reserves, saying a 2010 feasibility study 2010 was flawed, and cancelling another contract with the same Chinese investors to build a hydroelectric dam.

business,"Asian shares steady as Chinese markets return, US yields gain"," HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares held onto gains on Friday, and were set to snap a four week streak of weekly losses as Chinese markets came back a bit more positive after a long holiday, encouraged by a survey showing services sector activity improving. In the bond market, the U.S. Senate's approval legislation to temporarily raise the federal government's debt limit sparked a sell-off which saw U.S. Treasuries benchmark yields rise to their highest since June ahead of key jobs data. Japan's Nikkei index U.S. 500 S&P futures  were flat and pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures  shed 0.1%, also suggesting yesterday's global rally is petering out.

However, bonds and shares issued by Chinese property firms slumped on Friday with no sign in sight of a resolution to cash-strapped China Evergrande Group's Elsewhere, Australian shares Also supporting risk sentiment was the U.S. Senate's approval of legislation to temporarily raise the federal government's debt limit and avoid the risk of a historic default. This sparked a sell off in U.S. government bonds, and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields  rose to as high as 1.5940% in early Asian trade, their highest since mid June when they touched the same level. They were last at 1.5925%. Traders are also waiting for U.S. payroll data for September due out later in the global day. They expect employment figures that are near consensus will lead the Federal Reserve to indicate at its November meeting when it will begin tapering its massive stimulus program. CBA analysts said it was possible the jobs data could surprise on the downside, but ""we think it would take a larger miss than we are anticipating to stop the [Federal Reserve] from announcing a taper in November."" They said a strong payrolls print would support the U.S. dollar because it would signal an imminent taper.

business,California bars forced non-disclosure clauses in severance agreements," Oct 7 (Reuters) - California will bar companies from requiring non-disclosure agreements in settlements with employees over workplace harassment claims under a bill signed into law on Thursday in a win for tech workers who championed the proposal. The Silenced No More Act had been co-sponsored by Ifeoma Ozoma, who quit Pinterest Inc Supporters say the law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will enable workers to speak out about experiences of harassment and discrimination without fear that companies could tear up severance packages. They say allowing more people to publicly address workplace treatment could help curb systemic racism and other problems ailing many companies. The new law says settlement agreements cannot prevent or restrict workers from disclosing facts related to harassment and discrimination claims they have filed against the company. It also bars settlements from including non-disparagement clauses that stop people from talking about unlawful acts in the workplace. As part of efforts to respond to #metoo stories, California lawmakers three years ago banned companies from imposing non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, in cases of sexual harassment, sexual assault or sex discrimination out of concern that secret deals were allowing companies to maintain problematic cultures. The new law covers confidentiality in a broader range of cases, including racial discrimination and harassment based on disability. Ozoma last year said that as a Black woman, she was pushed aside by managers at Pinterest for some tasks and underpaid. Supporters said the new law will help hold companies accountable to promises they have made to offer a diverse and inclusive workplace. Pinterest signed on as a supporter of the legislation.

business,European stocks log best week in two months," Oct 8 (Reuters) - European stocks ended a volatile session lower on Friday as investors digested data showing slowing jobs growth in the United States, but they still marked their best week in two months as fears of soaring inflation were tempered. A U.S. Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 jobs last month, compared with an expectation of 500,000. Although the headline number was a huge miss, analysts said excluding the seasonally adjusted factors, the number was not too disappointing. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ""Payrolls data came in weaker than expected, but the overall trend of an improving labor market remains intact,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. While strong numbers could cement the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve's withdrawal of its support for the economy, many analysts expect that even a second straight weak employment report may not be enough to hold back the central bank from announcing a slowdown of its bond purchases later this year.

""This is not a matter of, sort of, Tesla leaving California,"" he said, saying it plans to increase output from its main California factory and Nevada factory by 50%. The Fremont, California factory nonetheless is ""jammed"" and it is tough for people to afford houses in California, he said. Billionaire Musk himself moved to the Lone Star State from California in December to focus on the electric-car maker?�s new plant in the state and his SpaceX rocket company, which has a launch site in the southern tip of Texas. Musk had a rocky relationship at times with California, threatening to move Tesla headquarters and future programs to Texas during a row over the closure of Tesla?�s factory in Fremont, California due to COVID-19, for instance. At the meeting he showed off a design of what looked like a cowboy-style belt buckle emblazoned with ""Don't Mess With T"" -- the T in the style of the Tesla logo. The phrase is based on a venerable and popular Texas anti-littering campaign - Don't Mess with Texas. DIRECTOR TERM CUT Despite some criticism from activist shareholders and a proxy advisory service, shareholders followed board guidance on several key proposals, including reelection of Kimball Musk, Elon's brother, and James Murdoch as board directors. But they voted in favour of a stockholder proposal to reduce director terms from three years to one year and a proposal regarding additional reporting on diversity and inclusion efforts. ""It's unfortunate that the shareholders did not agree to remove Murdoch and Musk's brother. But I think they know the pressure is on them,"" Stephen Diamond, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, said. ""They've got a lot more work to do on governance.

Advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had recommended that Tesla investors not re-elect the two directors because of concerns about excessive compensation packages to non-executive board members. Shareholders also voted against a stockholder proposal asking for a study into the impact of Tesla's use of arbitration on workplace harassment and discrimination.

business,Dollar edges higher as jobs data eyed for Fed policy clues," TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher versus major peers on Friday but within a narrow range as traders awaited clues on the pace of Federal Reserve policy normalization from a monthly payrolls report. The U.S. Dollar Currency Index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six peers, rose 0.1% to 94.278, keeping within sight of last week's one-year peak of 94.504. The dollar gained 0.26% to 111.91 yen , and touched 111.93, the highest level this month, helped by higher Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year note hitting 1.6010% for the first time since June 4. The euro  consolidated around $1.1550, after dipping on Wednesday to a 14-month low of $1.1529. The Federal Reserve has said it is likely to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and follow up with interest rate increases potentially next year, as the U.S. central bank's turn from pandemic crisis policies gains momentum. Friday's non-farm payrolls data is expected to show continued improvement in the labour market, with a consensus forecast for 500,000 jobs added in September, although estimates ranged from 250,000 to 700,000, a Reuters poll showed. Following the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said the upcoming payrolls report need not be ""a knock-out, great, super-strong"" report to keep policy makers on track toward tapering, but it would need to be ""reasonably good"". Powell's comment ""should make markets more tolerant of a downside surprise in particular, and the balance of risks favours a positive USD reaction"" to the jobs data, Adam Cole, the chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar  slipped back 0.22% to $0.7297, following a 0.55% surge on Thursday. It earlier touched $0.7324 for a second day running, the strongest level since Sept. 16. The Aussie has made ""a decent go at breaking higher,"" but the test will be whether it can stay about $0.7315 following several failed attempts this year, Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, wrote in a client note. Sterling  slipped 0.1% to $1.3600, holding on to most of a 0.26% gain from Thursday, when new Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said inflation pressures were proving stickier than initially thought, reinforcing expectations for a rate hike by February.

business,"Despite preparation, California pipeline operator may have taken hours to stop leak"," LOS ANGELES, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The company that operates the pipeline that spilled an estimated 3,000 barrels of oil into the Pacific Ocean off California has an 800-page manual on handling an oil spill - but it is unclear whether its employees followed those procedures. Houston-based Amplify Energy Corp  and several state and federal regulatory agencies have provided differing accounts of what happened on Oct. 2, when the pipeline spill that fouled beaches, killed wildlife and closed down fishing along miles of coastline was officially reported. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said Beta Offshore, an Amplify subsidiary that operates the pipeline, received a low-pressure warning in its control room about 2:30 a.m. Pacific time (5:30 a.m. EDT) on Oct. 2, a sign of a rupture in the line. The leak-detection alarm should have triggered rapid phone calls to managers, boat crews, regulators and the U.S. Coast Guard, and swiftly set in motion steps to shut down the pipeline and platform that feeds it, according to 10 former and current Beta Offshore employees and contractors, as well as a copy of the company's spill response plan reviewed by Reuters. But the San Pedro Bay Pipeline wasn't shut down until 6 a.m. Pacific, about three and a half hours later, according to PHMSA's timeline. Amplify CEO Martyn Willsher has said the company was not aware of the spill until mid-morning. ""We were not aware of any spills until 8:09 a.m. (Pacific) on Saturday morning,"" he said at a news conference on Wednesday. He noted that the line was shut off about 6 a.m., but did not explain why or for how long, adding: ""We were not pumping oil at 8:09 a.m. when we actually discovered oil on the water."" In response to a reporter's question on Wednesday about the 2:30 a.m. alarm, Willsher said: ""We were not aware of any alarm at 2:30."" He also said the company was investigating the timeline and ""working with regulators to see if there was anything that should have been noticed."" Amplify did not respond to requests for comment on this remark. The company also did not respond to several other requests for comment. Tom Haug, a third-party contractor who is listed as an Incident Commander in the response plan, referred questions to Amplify's official spokesperson. The 16-inch diameter, 17-mile-long pipeline runs from Amplify's Elly oil production platform offshore to Long Beach, where the oil is stored and transported for refining. The spill's volume is miniscule compared with others that have sparked regulatory change, such the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which released more than 5 million barrels of oil into the water. Still, it raises questions about the effectiveness of government-mandated spill response plans, which are meant to ensure companies react quickly to minimize pollution and public hazards. The cause of the California spill is under investigation. Officials are probing whether the rupture may have been caused by a strike from a ship's anchor. Investigators discovered a section of the pipeline had moved 105 feet and had a 13-inch split running parallel to the pipe. Residents and nearby vessels have said they first noticed foul smells and a sheen on the water on Friday evening, according to the U.S. National Response Center, the designated point of contact for environmental accidents. The U.S. Coast Guard has said reports of this type are common, however, and do not always indicate a spill. ""In General - For Spill Response - Do Not Delay. Plan Ahead. Over-respond and stand down if necessary. Do not get behind on the curve,??Amplify's response plan says, in laying out a 15-step action plan for reacting to spills. UNDER PRESSURE Amplify produced 3,600 barrels per day at its platforms in California in the second quarter of this year, making it the second-largest offshore producer in that state. Federal regulators mandated in 1994 that operators be trained to shut off pipelines and platforms in the event of a leak or rupture. Former Amplify employees say the company had conducted such training in the last two years. Amplify did not confirm whether those efforts had continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. But records from the California Office of Spill Prevention and Response show Beta conducted a drill virtually using the Microsoft Teams platform last year. Another was scheduled for next month. Software made specifically for the platform monitors the status of pressure at pumps along the pipeline, two former employees said. Sensors on the pipeline can notify an operator on the Elly platform if pressure changes, triggering an immediate shutdown and halting the flow of crude into the pipeline. ""After they detected a single barrel, the pipeline should have shut,"" said a former employee familiar with the line's operations. Willsher said this week that Amplify's employees monitored the pipeline by boat weekly. The company reviews the chemical properties of the oil to ensure iron levels are not high, which would indicate a pipe's deterioration, another former employee familiar with the procedure said. A third former employee recalled that U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) inspectors frequently visited the platform and reviewed its pipeline connections. The inspections were meticulous and lasted weeks, and citations were issued for even the smallest items, such as corrosion on a handrail, one employee recounted. Inspection reports two years ago determined that the pipeline was sound and that anomalies in the metal walls detected in past inspections had been remedied, according to a summary of an inspector's report from October 2019, filed with the BSEE in April 2020.

business,Analysis: China protest sets stage for U.N. plane emissions debate," MONTREAL, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Commercial aviation's key players are backing a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but high costs and opposition from China remain obstacles toward reaching a global climate goal at a United Nations aviation meeting next fall. Major plane and engine makers joined airlines gathering in Boston earlier this week to But state-controlled Chinese airlines objected at the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) meeting, saying developing countries should not be held to the same standards as developed nations, reflecting longstanding divisions that some see as a dress rehearsal for the 2022 gathering in Montreal. The same divide seen at IATA could make it difficult for countries to come together behind a common goal for aviation. Airlines want members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to support a global long-term goal that would influence governments to take action to achieve the target, like funding the production of sustainable aviation fuel. The ICAO ""faces an enormous challenge and its credibility is really on the line,"" said Annie Petsonk, the U.S. Transportation Department's principal deputy assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs. IATA's 2050 plan requires large amounts of sustainable aviation fuel, but supply is not widely available and it is more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel. ""If ICAO is able to identify and agree on a clear long-term aspirational goal, that will make an enormous difference in pointing the direction ... toward meeting that goal,"" Petsonk told a recent forum. ICAO cannot impose rules on governments but holds clout among its 193 member countries. Aviation was excluded from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, where countries agreed to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5 degrees. To do that, scientists say the world needs to cut emissions to net zero by 2050. IATA's new commitment brings the industry into alignment with the 1.5-degree target for the first time, airline industry officials said. Environmentalists say this is not enough. The association's net-zero goal comes weeks ahead of a follow-up U.N. COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow. For aviation, talks will come to a head at ICAO's assembly, where the West wants a long-term goal supported by China, expected to be the biggest aviation market by the end of this decade. ICAO's governing council is weighing the impact of a long-term goal on growth and on costs to aviation, especially for developing countries. ""We need a fair goal,"" Angie Elyazzy, ICAO's council member from Egypt, told a recent industry forum. ""The goal shouldn't be one-sized-fits-all,"" she said, adding is should follow the notion of developed countries shouldering more responsibility since they produced more emissions in the past. State carrier China Eastern ""I think we're going to see the same debate play out at ICAO during the next assembly,"" said Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, an environmental research group based in Washington. More than 130 countries have set or are considering a target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, the United Nations says. China instead aims to be ""carbon neutral"" by 2060, but scientists have said the target won't go far enough to curb more severe impacts of climate change. ""It?�s going to be challenging to get an agreement at ICAO next year,"" said one aviation official involved in the talks. Disputes ""are not necessarily always technical, but political,"" the official said. Rutherford said follow-up actions by the Chinese carriers at IATA could bode well for ICAO's assembly, since their objections did not derail the outcome of the airlines' meeting. ""The fact they (Chinese carriers) chose not to obstruct is important.""

business,Biden calls on more U.S. businesses to require COVID-19 vaccinations," ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill., Oct 7 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday said more U.S. businesses should obligate workers to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, calling the move vital to ending the pandemic and sustaining the economy. ""Today I'm calling on more employers to act,"" Biden said. ""My message is: Require your employees to get vaccinated. With vaccinations, we're going to beat this pandemic finally. Without them, we face endless months of chaos in our hospitals, damage to our economy and anxiety in our schools."" Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, and for private employers with 100 or more workers to require staff to be vaccinated by Dec. 8, or get tested for the coronavirus weekly. That order covers 100 million people, about two-thirds of the workforce. The president intensified the call on Thursday on a visit to the construction site of a future Microsoft Corp Biden highlighted other vaccination success stories, including a move by Chicago-based United Airlines Biden praised other airlines and businesses that followed suit, including entertainment company Walt Disney Co Immunization requirements have broad public support, and Wall Street economists agree higher vaccination rates will stoke economic growth and add jobs, the Democratic president said. Biden's workplace vaccine order spurred pushback from high profile Republican governors and resistant Americans. Biden said he was initially reluctant to order vaccinations. ""We have to beat this thing. So, while I didn't race to do it right away, that's why I've had to move toward requirements (that) everyone get vaccinated, where I had the authority to do that,"" he said. Biden's mandate announcement in September came at a breaking-point moment as his administration struggled to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans, as a large swath of the nation's population refused to accept free vaccinations that have been available for months. A surge of hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus has threatened not just the country but a president who ran on promises to get control of the pandemic. Biden's approval ratings have sagged since he said in July the United States was ""closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that cases and hospitalizations have edged down on average over the last seven days, but cautioned that deaths - a lagging indicator - are still at 1,400 per day, primarily among the unvaccinated. Our Standards: The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives is expected on Tuesday to give final approval to a Senate-passed bill temporarily raising the government's borrowing limit to $28.9 trillion, putting off the risk of default until early December."
business,Oil rises 4% in week as energy crunch shows no signs of easing," NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Friday, gaining about 4% on the week as a global energy crunch boostedU.S. prices to their highest in almost seven years as big power users struggle to meet demand. Even with worldwide demand growing as economic activity rebounds from pandemic lows, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers (OPEC+) this week said they would remain on the path of gradually bringing back production. Meanwhile the U.S. government said it was monitoring energy markets, but it did not announce immediate action to lower prices, such as a release from strategic petroleum reserves, which further supported the oil market. Brent crude  futures rose 44 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $82.39 a barrel. Earlier in the week, the global benchmark hit a three-year high of $83.47. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  rose $1.05, or 1.3%, to end at $79.35. That was the highest close for the U.S. benchmark since Oct. 31, 2014. U.S. gasoline  futures also closed at their highest since October 2014 on Friday. ""The fundamental backdrop is one of tight supplies that is going to continue to push these prices steadily higher,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York. As energy markets have tightened in the face of improved fuel demand, many fear that a cold winter could further strain natural gas supplies. China ordered miners in Inner Mongolia to ramp up coal production to alleviate its energy crunch. ""As other energy prices like natural gas and coal keep pushing higher, upside risks to the oil market have started to build,"" said Bank of America's Christopher Kuplent. The price run-up has been spurred by soaring European gas prices, which have encouraged a switch to oil for power generation. Benchmark European gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub  on Friday stood at a crude oil equivalent of about $200 a barrel, based on the relative value of the same quantity of energy from each source, according to Reuters calculations based on Eikon data. ""An acceleration in gas-to-oil switching could boost crude oil demand used to generate power this coming northern hemisphere winter,"" an ANZ commodities analyst said in a note. ANZ increased its 2021 fourth-quarter crude oil demand forecast by 450,000 barrels per day.

business,Republican lawmakers accuse White House of pressuring airlines on vaccines," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Two senior U.S. lawmakers on Thursday accused the White House of pressuring U.S. airlines to require their employees be vaccinated for COVID-19 by a Dec. 8 deadline for federal contractors or face firing. Representative Sam Graves, top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Garrett Graves, senior Republican on the aviation subcommittee, wrote President Joe Biden on Thursday, saying it ""is unacceptable that your administration is using the threat of contractual measures as a coercion to single out American workers in a vital national industry."" The lawmakers, who are not related, cited a Reuters story reporting that White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients had called the chief executives of American Airlines Zients on Wednesday praised airlinesfor mandating vaccines. ""Vaccination requirements work. New data reinforces that fact each day,"" he said. Three of the airlines and the White House declined comment.    Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have since announced they will meet the Dec. 8 deadline for federal contractors. Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Sunday that the airline has not madea decision. President The letter noted Congress since March 2020 awarded U.S. airlines a total of $54 billion in taxpayer funding for payroll costs, which only ended last week. ""We strongly urge you to rethink this ill-conceived mandate which will result in the termination of employees whose jobs were saved over the last 18 months at enormous taxpayer expense,"" they wrote. ""This unilateral mandate and arbitrary deadline will serve only to disrupt airline operations and increase the likelihood of canceled flights.""

business,China's Sept services activity returns to growth - Caixin PMI," BEIJING, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector returned to growth in September as a major COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern province of Jiangsu receded, a private-sector survey showed on Friday, offering some support to a slowing economy. The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.4 from 46.7 in August, pulling away from the lowest level seen since the height of the pandemic last year. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. The better readings in the survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, are in line with findings in an official survey last week which also showed the services industry returned to activity growth. Analysts say the services sector, which was slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country, clouding the outlook for the much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come. ""In view of this, in the coming months, the government should focus on improving epidemic prevention and control and alleviating supply-side pressure,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. ""It should also find a balance among multiple objectives, such as promoting employment, holding raw material prices stable, ensuring a stable and orderly supply, and meeting targets for controlling energy consumption."" Sub-indexes of new business, prices charged, and employment all bounced back to expansionary territory in September, although new export business shrank again, touching the lowest in seven months due to the surging pandemic overseas. Input prices increased for the 15th straight month in September and rose at a faster pace, driven by rising labour, freight and raw material costs, the survey found, an issue that drove factory activity into contraction last month. Caixin's September composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, rose to 51.4 in September from 47.2 the previous month, buoyed by strength in the services sector. Our Standards: KKR & Co Inc said on Monday it has elevated its co-presidents Scott Nuttall and Joseph Bae to co-chief executive officers, succeeding the storied private equity firm's billionaire co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts."
business,U.S. labor market regaining footing as weekly jobless claims fall sharply," WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped by the most in three months last week, suggesting the labor market recovery was regaining momentum after a recent slowdown, as the wave of COVID-19 infections began to subside. The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls plunging to an 18-month low in late September. Improving labor market conditions bode well for the government's closely watched employment report for September and also provide ammunition for the Federal Reserve, which signaled last month it could begin reducing is monthly bond buying as soon as November. ""The labor market is back on track after a few weeks of rising claims threw a question mark into the markets' understanding of just how solid the economic outlook really is,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The Fed has the evidence it needs to start paring back its emergency stimulus purchases when it meets next month."" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That was the biggest drop since late June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 348,000 claims for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, tumbled 41,431 to 258,909 last week. California led the drop in claims last week. There were also decreases in Michigan, Ohio, Washington DC and Missouri. They offset notable increases in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Claims had increased for three straight weeks as California moved people to another program following the expiration of federal government-funded aid on Sept. 6, to allow the recipients to collect one additional week of benefits. There had also been increases in filings related to the idling of assembly plants in some states by automakers as they managed their supply of semiconductors amid a global shortage. A resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, also disrupted activity in the high-contact services sector. That suggested some moderation in labor market conditions in the prior weeks, which was confirmed by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 14% to 17,895 in September. Still, layoffs were down 85% compared to September 2020. In the third quarter, employers announced 52,560 job cuts, the fewest since the second quarter of 1997 and down 23% from the July-September period. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. SUPPLY WOES Layoffs last month were led by companies in the healthcare/products sector, with 2,673 announced cuts. Since the Pfizer vaccine received full-FDA approval, many healthcare facilities have implemented vaccine mandates, which have led to the firing of non-compliant workers. Ongoing strains in the supply chain saw industrial goods manufacturers laying off 2,328 workers in September, while warehousing businesses reported 1,936 job cuts. There were 1,679 job cuts in the services sector. But the rise in layoffs was dwarfed by an explosion in planned hiring, in part as retailers gear up for the holiday season. The Challenger report showed companies announced plans to hire 939,790 workers compared to only 94,004 in August. With companies eager to hire, more people are coming off the state unemployment rolls. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 97,000 to 2.714 million in the week ended Sept. 25. That was the lowest level since mid-March 2020. The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped to 4.172 million during the week ended Sept. 18 from 5.027 million in the prior week. That reflected the end of extended benefits last month, which economists hope will increase the labor pool. The pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the coronavirus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. That has left employers desperate to fill a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July. The worker shortages have impacted job growth, though there is optimism that hiring picked up in September. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 500,000 jobs last month. Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000, reflecting the mixed labor market indicators in September. A survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. While the Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in August, its measure of services industry employment slipped. The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5.1% in September from 5.2% in August. ""Going forward, the combination of easing labor supply constraints, strong labor demand and an improving COVID outlook should spur further labor market progress,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. Our Standards: Authorities from Beijing to Delhi scrambled to fill a yawning power supply gap on Tuesday, triggering global stock and bond market wobbles on worries that rising energy costs will stoke inflation and curtail an economic recovery."

business,Rising chip prices fuel Samsung's best quarterly profit in 3 years," SEOUL, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd The preliminary result was up 26% from the second quarter, although just below forecasts, while the market reaction was further muted as analysts pencilled in a flat or slightly lower result this quarter on an expected fall in memory chip prices. The world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker estimated its July-September profit at 15.8 trillion won ($13.3 billion), below a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 16.1 trillion won. It is the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018. ""The mobile business' operating margin might have been lower than the market expected,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. ""We will have to see marketing costs and what the mix of products Samsung sold was like."" Rising memory chip prices and shipments, plus a jump in profitability at Samsung's chip contract manufacturing business, likely raised the chip division's operating profit by about 79% from a year earlier, analysts said. Semiconductors accounted for about half of Samsung's operating profit in the first half of the year. Samsung shares pared early gains to be up 0.4% in afternoon trade. It is due to announce detailed earnings later this month. The stock has fallen about 12% so far this year versus a 3% rise in the wider market Analysts said prices for memory chips are expected to tumble this quarter as demand for personal computers drops amid an expected easing in global lockdowns that have helped power sales, while smartphone shipments may also decline.

The risk-sensitive Australian dollar held near the three-week high hit overnight, when it surged 0.55% against the greenback. Global equities rallied and bond yields climbed after U.S. Senate leaders moved to avert a U.S. debt default, while a global easing in energy prices tempered simmering stagflation fears. ""The improvement in risk appetite favours pro-growth currencies, with safe-haven pairs the underperformers,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, wrote in a client note. The Aussie has made ""a decent go at breaking higher,"" but the test will be whether it can stay about $0.7315 following several failed attempts this year, Catril said. Australia's currency  was almost flat at $0.73105 from Thursday, when it rallied as high as $0.7324 for the first time since Sept. 16. The U.S. Dollar Currency Index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six peers, was little changed at 94.202 after trading in a tight range on Thursday, staying within sight of last week's high of 94.504, a level not seen since late September 2020.

However a U.S. Department of Energy source told Reuters  that a social media post by a Bloomberg reporter which said the department was not considering tapping into the SPR ""at this time"" was not accurate. Overall, the week's run-up has been spurred by soaring gas prices encouraging a switch to oil for power generation and by some industries, along with a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, together called OPEC+, to stick to plans to add only 400,000 barrels per day of supply in November.

business,"NYSE like a drugged bull in bullfight over share orders, exchange president says"," NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The head of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday called for regulators to change rules that make it difficult for the NYSE to compete for stock orders, as the market share of exchanges has dwindled versus off-exchange trading platforms during the retail trading boom. ""On exchange, we are artificially constrained from competing for pretty much half of the market,"" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ""It's like we're in a bullfight, and sure, you can beat the price on an exchange if you've drugged the bull and starved him for two weeks,"" she said at an annual conference held by the Securities Traders Association. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has said his agency is revisiting regulations he says may create an One rule the SEC is reviewing is referred to as the ""sub-penny rule."" It prevents exchanges from displaying bid and offer quotes in increments smaller than a penny, whereas off-exchange trading platforms can offer fractional, sub-penny price discounts to exchange prices, which is attractive to retail brokers that are required to get their clients the best prices. The rule was enacted in 2005 over concerns that if smaller pricing increments were allowed, sophisticated traders might use them to jump ahead of retail orders. In 2021, the vast majority of retail orders have been  executed through wholesale brokers.

business,"U.S. banks expected to report mixed Q3 results, iffy loan outlook"," Oct 7 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. lenders are expected to report moderately higher third-quarter profits next week as pandemic-related accounting adjustments that had doubled their earnings earlier this year taper off and business starts to return to normal. Analysts, on average, expect JPMorgan Chase & Co Next Thursday, Citigroup Inc Goldman Group Inc Stock buybacks will provide a lift to earnings-per-share in the quarter and coming periods. Investment banking divisions should deliver spectacular gains thanks to a record-breaking boom in takeovers, while a decline in fixed-income trading revenue will be partially offset by strong equity volumes. But analysts say the focus will be on whether net interest revenue, which provides more than half of banking industry revenue but has been stagnant in recent quarters, is set to rise in coming months on higher interest rates and new loan demand from businesses and consumers. ""That's going to be the question. It is the heart of the business for everybody,"" said Gerard Cassidy, analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Some banks could show they are earning more interest because they started investing more of their excess cash in securities, such as 5-year U.S. Treasury notes which were recently yielding 1%, three times as much as at the start of the year. Analysts will also look for signs that commercial and industrial borrowing has stopped declining. They expect an  increase once COVID-hampered supply chains recover and allow businesses to build inventories that need bank financing. Many businesses and consumers paid down loans during the pandemic. Bank of America's 35% expected jump in profits is likely to be driven by smaller provisions for loan losses and a rise in net interest income. Its results may suggest its strategy of investing its excess cash in government and mortgage-backed securities has paid off. Unlike earlier this year, banks will benefit only marginally this quarter from releasing reserves for pandemic-related loan losses that did not materialize. Banks have already released 60% of a combined $50 billion of reserves they had put aside and will likely release only $5 billion more this quarter, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden. He expects Wells Fargo and Citigroup will feel the greatest benefit. Results for those two banks could also be influenced by how much they are having to spend to comply with orders from regulators to improve their controls. Wells Fargo's year-earlier profits were hurt by costs for making amends to customers for wrongs. M&A FEES, TRADING Takeover advisory fees at the big investment banks will be up by 80% on average, Cassidy said, adding that he also expects a lift from equity underwriting. Trading revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be down about 10% on average because fixed income markets, which drove record trading volumes last year, have settled down to more normal levels. JPMorgan third-quarter net income is expected to decline about 3% from a year earlier on lower trading revenue and higher expenses, according to the average analyst estimate. Results from investment banking giant and money manager Morgan Stanley are expected to rise on higher takeover advisory fees, stronger equities trading revenue and more wealth management fees. Goldman Sachs is also expected to benefit from higher  mergers and acquisitions fees amid the biggest global deals boom on record.

business,Boeing's Chicago HQ a 'ghost town' as priorities shift," SEATTLE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Twenty years ago, just days before the 9/11 attacks on the United States crippled the aerospace industry, Boeing Co The move was central to Boeing's plan to forge a new identity as a diversified global juggernaut, distancing top executives from the daily operations inside far-flung business units, and getting closer to Wall Street and major customers. Two decades on, in the midst of a fresh crisis shaking the industry, Boeing's corporate hub is in a state of limbo. A new crop of top executives based mainly on the coasts are managing industrial and safety certification problems at its major divisions and the lingering fallout from the 737 MAX and coronavirus crises. At the same time, tax incentives heaped on Boeing by Chicago and Illinois run out at year-end. Once the symbol of a new Boeing, the vision of a corporate epicenter rising above its constituent parts has fallen at odds with the imperative of recapturing engineering dominance and repairing relationships with customers and federal regulators. Chief Executive Dave Calhoun, for example, spent the beginning of the year at Boeing's factory in South Carolina dealing with production-related defects that have hobbled the program, people familiar with the matter said. Other top executives, like newly minted CFO Brian West, are also based primarily on the U.S. East Coast and a hush has descended on the exclusive but functional top floor, although the pandemic has also been a major factor, the people said. ""It's a ghost town,"" one of the people added. The headquarters - a 36-floor, $200 million riverfront skyscraper - sits at the crossroads of a cost-cutting campaign that has seen Boeing shed real estate, including its commercial airplane headquarters in Seattle. Several people close to the company say cost cuts and a more  hands-on corporate culture have raised questions about Boeing's long-term future in the city, and in turn the broad direction Boeing intends to take as it tries to regain its stride. Boeing, however, insists significant operations still take place there and rebuffs any suggestion that the giant may leave its Midwest base. ""Chicago is strategically important to Boeing's U.S. and global operations,"" a spokesperson said. ""As with other companies, we have adapted to hybrid ways of working in the midst of the global pandemic to engage with our people, and our customers and other stakeholders."" Boeing and employees have invested nearly $50 million in support of Chicagoland communities in recent years, Boeing said. Despite the new focus, others caution exiting the city would risk a local firestorm and remains far from Boeing's immediate priorities amid a slew of industrial and regulatory problems. NEUTRAL LOCATION Boeing left its Seattle home after 85 years following its 1997 merger with St. Louis-based rival McDonnell Douglas - a decision that angered rank-and-file mechanics and engineers. Boeing was seeking a post-merger headquarters in a neutral location separate from those existing divisional power centers. But some critics viewed Boeing's Chicago move as a symbol of a company that prized near-term profits and shareholder returns over long-term engineering dominance - a charge repeated after  crashes of 737 MAX jets that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019. ""It began as a way of signaling that they would make future investments without regard to any legacy loyalties,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""To some, it has merely become a way of indicating that they will not make any future investments at all."" INCENTIVES EXPIRING Chicago, Cook County and Illinois awarded Boeing more than $60 million in tax and other incentives over 20 years to relocate. Those credits have expired or will expire at year-end, though Boeing will receive 2021 funds next year, the spokesperson said. The incentives, which were temporarily swept up in a trade spat with Europe's Airbus over mutual claims of unfair support, required Boeing to keep 500 full-time employees at the office. Boeing reported 513 full-time employees in Chicago for 2020, a city spokesperson said. Boeing also employs thousands of people in Chicago and the Metro East region in southern Illinois near St. Louis, a state spokesperson said. But analysis last year by the Better Government Association, which scrutinizes Illinois state decisions, found that Boeing fell short of the 500-employee mark in at least four years. ""Numbers reported by the company to the state and city differ, have never been audited, and in some years fell short of the public target,"" it said. The indirect impact from Boeing employees in the Chicago area had been pegged at $4.3 billion over 20 years, Pam McDonough, a former director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, said in a LinkedIn article last year.

business,Biden says U.S. will 'deal' with violence on airplanes," WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard airplanes, many involving the requirement to wear face coverings. ""I've instructed the Justice Department to make sure that we deal with the violence on aircraft,"" Biden said at a speech in Illinois. ""We're going to deal with that."" To date this year, there have been 4,626 reports of The Justice Department did not immediately comment. Many incidents onboard airplanes have been captured by passengers and posted on social media, drawing significant attention. Last month, two senior U.S. Senate Democrats In June, a group representing major U.S. airlines such as American Airlines The letter from Airlines for America said the ""incidents pose a safety and security threat to our passengers and employees."" Last month, Delta called on other U.S. airlines to share lists of passengers who have been banned during the COVID-19 pandemic for disruptive behavior to help deter the rising number of incidents. The carrier said during the COVID-19 pandemic it has put more than 1,600 people on its ""no fly"" list. FAA Administrator Steve Dickson imposed in January a zero-tolerance order on passenger disturbances aboard airplanes after supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on flights around the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. That policy will extend until at least as long as federal mask rules on airplanes are in place, which were extended in August into mid-January 2022.

business,Automakers funding new tech aimed at making greener lithium for EVs," CALIPATRIA, Calif., Oct 7 (Reuters) - Automakers, investors and even oilfield giant Schlumberger NV Stellantis , Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and others have invested millions of dollars or signed supply agreements with so-called direct lithium extraction (DLE) start-ups in recent months in an attempt to propel the technology to commercial production, expected within the next year or two. DLE technologies use less land and groundwater than hard rock mining and brine evaporation ponds - the traditional ways to process the white metal. Industry analysts see it as a new way to help ensure lithium supply for the EV industry - if the technology can work on a large scale. ""More green lithium is the promise of this new technology,"" said Kasper Sage of BMW i Ventures, BMW's DLE technologies are comparable to common household water softeners, which remove metals from drinking water. The process can take as little as a few hours to filter the metal inside an average-sized warehouse. By contrast, traditional evaporation ponds can be hundreds of acres in size, permanently drain nearby aquifers and take several years to produce lithium. However, most DLE technologies are more expensive to operate than evaporation ponds, which use sunlight, and some require large volumes of freshwater and electricity. Albemarle Corp ""Access to clean water is one of the key hindrances to DLE,"" said John Peichel of Suez PA's Schlumberger, known for its hydraulic fracturing work, is building a DLE project in Nevada and says its ""ultimate goal"" is to produce lithium without any freshwater. It is a goal the U.S. Department of Energy is supporting with a $4 million contest for the best geothermal lithium technological developments. WALL STREET The potential hurdles have not hindered Wall Street's interest in so-called green lithium. Standard Lithium Ltd.'s  shares have risen six-fold since they started trading in New York in July, even though the company's DLE technology is still being piloted in Arkansas. Australia's Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd Chris Berry, an independent industry analyst with House Mountain Partners, says that based on existing announcements, DLE could produce a quarter of global lithium supply by the end of the decade, though he noted not all technologies should be treated as equal. Other industry consultants put that figure even higher. Global demand for lithium last year was about 320,000 tonnes, and is expected to hit 1 million tonnes by 2025 and 3 million tonnes by the end of the decade. ""Investors need to weigh the benefits of DLE technology against a host of challenges in tailoring the technology to each lithium deposit,"" Berry said. One area drawing attention from DLE developers is California's Salton Sea, roughly 160 miles (258 km) southeast of Los Angeles. Superhot brines teeming with lithium swirl under the area, which sits atop the San Andreas Fault. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc Nearby, privately held Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd is developing a geothermal lithium brine project That project, as well as The DLE attention comes as prices for lithium are near all-time highs, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, fueling the race for new technologies. ""Lithium supply is the main bottleneck to electrification and DLE can help boost that supply,"" said Teague Egan, chief executive of Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, a privately held company working with Argentina lithium producer Orocobre Ltd Our Standards: France wants to be a leader in green hydrogen by 2030 and build low-carbon planes and small nuclear reactors as part of a 30 billion euro ($35 billion) investment plan, President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday."
business,Tesla's gigafactory electrifies California-Germany culture clash," BERLIN, Oct 7 (Reuters) - With final approval for its German factory potentially just weeks away, Tesla's Despite pandemic-related curbs limiting gatherings in Germany to under 5,000 people, Tesla applied for - and got - a Coming on the heels of officials allowing the company to break ground on its new site before final approval had even been granted, environmental groups say this is just the latest example of Tesla being given too much leeway to act disruptively in Germany - a pattern they worry will continue. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The pre-approvals Musk has received from local authorities to build without final permission are legal, but rarely used by German firms because of the associated risk: if final approval is not granted, Tesla must pay to tear everything down. While some bemoan Musk's approach as throwing German caution to the wind, others - who say German regulations governing planning, jobs and environmental concerns are unnecessarily restrictive - welcome the influence he could have on the country's business culture. ""I am fully convinced Tesla can have a positive effect on Germany,"" Brandenburg's economy minister Joerg Steinbach, a prominent advocate of the factory, told Reuters. ""The fundamental idea of taking a close look at current legislation and checking whether it could perhaps be modernised - without risking a loss to legal clout - is in my opinion absolutely worth considering."" The country's powerful unions are already gearing up to fight for German-style contracts for Tesla workers, environmental groups are poised to oppose any further expansion plans, and locals wary of Musk's 'American' ways are watching the firm's every move. ""Tesla has to stick to environmental protection laws, building laws, and of course labour and unionisation laws,"" Birgit Dietze, head of the Brandenburg region for union IG Metall and a former member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, said. Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change. Once running, the factory will produce 500,000 electric cars a year and generate 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity ??more than any other plant in the country. Conversations between the union and applicants indicate Tesla, whose CEO is known for his rocky relationship with organised labour, is offering pay 20% below the collectively bargained wages offered at other German automakers, IG Metall said. It is also shaking up conventional German contracts by offering packages with stock options and bonuses rather than predetermined holiday pay. Driving a harder bargain with its workforce could create a competitive advantage for Tesla, whose choice to set up its first European gigafactory in the homeland of Volkswagen Musk has already experienced German union power. When Tesla bought German car parts supplier Grohmann Automation in 2017, it set wages 30% below average, refusing to match collectively bargained pay. After the firm offered one-off bonuses and stock options instead, unions dropped a threat to strike. Unions say stock options have also been mooted at the Brandenburg factory. GERMAN CARMAKERS CAN'T DO IT - BUT TESLA CAN Of the 12,000 positions to be created at the factory, 800-1,200 have been filled so far, according to IG Metall and Steinbach. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment or questions on how recruitment was progressing. But data from LinkedIn suggest applications are low, with fewer than 10 applicants for most of the factory positions advertised in the past month. Gruenheide is a 45-minute drive from the Polish border, and Tesla is widely expected to recruit workers from there. ""20% under German wages is still very good pay for Polish workers,"" Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, an expert on the German auto industry, said. ""German automakers couldn't do it; they'd get into big trouble with the unions. But Tesla can do it."" Musk had planned on starting production in July in order to deliver the Model Y car to European customers from Berlin - but local opposition and the late addition of a battery plant requiring blueprints to be resubmitted to authorities held up the process. The delay forced Tesla to deliver the Model Y from Shanghai, prolonging waiting times and increasing costs. In a document published online in late September containing all 813 objections to the factory filed with local authorities and Tesla's responses, the company repeatedly reminded its critics that it was creating jobs and bringing Germany closer to its electric mobility goals. ""I understand the concerns. But some of it is selfish. It?�s always the same - people want things like wind farms and electric vehicles... just not in their backyard,"" said 60-year-old Grunheide local Ralf-Thomas Petersohn, a member of Germany's official Tesla fan club. A public hearing scheduled for Sept. 23 for citizens to discuss objections to the factory was moved online due to concerns that it could become a ""super-spreader event"", authorities said, a decision which some viewed as hypocritical considering the likely approval of Tesla's request for a 9,000-person party. ""This isn't about Tesla. It's about whether you take citizen participation seriously,"" Michael Ganschow of environmental organisation Gruene Liga said. ""We can't just say, 'You're making electric cars, so you can do whatever you want'."" Our Standards: Binance Smart Chain, a unit of crypto exchange Binance, said on Tuesday it had launched a $1 billion fund to help fast-track adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology."

business,IMF urges governments to make fiscal plans to tame pandemic debt," WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Governments should start planning a return to more sustainable budgets with policies that win the trust of investors, after unprecedented fiscal stimulus to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. But each country must determine the appropriate timing and pace of fiscal consolidation based on its own individual circumstances, the IMF said in its Fiscal Monitor report. The fiscal plans needed to consider the stage of the pandemic, existing fiscal vulnerabilities, the risk of economic scarring, pressures from aging populations, development needs and historical difficulties in collecting revenues. ""There are countries where the pandemic is still raging and therefore the priority continues to be the health emergency,"" IMF deputy fiscal affairs director Paulo Mauro told Reuters in an interview. Other countries where economic activity is picking up ""can start thinking about also gradually reducing the degree of fiscal support that they provide to the economy"", he said. A Fiscal Monitor chapter titled ""Strengthening the Credibility of Public Finances"" said countries that commit to medium-term fiscal sustainability with credible budget frameworks are rewarded with lower borrowing costs and a greater ability to refinance debts. ""What we find in the report is, governments can commit credibly to fiscal sustainability, that buys them time, and it buys them flexibility in this very difficult period of the pandemic,"" Mauro said. The report said IMF research showed countries with credible fiscal framework plans could more quickly reverse big jumps in debt, with feasibility for a 15% increase in debt to be reversed in a decade, absent additional shocks. The Fund recommended that countries commit to broad fiscal targets with underlying tax and spending policies for the next three to five years, with specific policies, such as a tax increases or raising the age for securing retirement benefits. Fiscal rules, such as keeping budget deficits within a certain percentage of gross domestic product, or independent fiscal councils within governments could add credibility, it said, adding that goals that were easy to communicate helped. But the IMF said fiscal plans should be flexible to allow economies to stabilize and avoid cuts in key public investments. ""Changes to taxes or spending can be pre-legislated and can be made contingent on the recovery,"" the IMF said. It cited Britain's announcement that corporate rates would rise in April 2023, and Israel's passage of a sunset for extended unemployment benefits linked to achieving a lower jobless rate.

business,ECB's brain trust spars over inflation outlook," FRANKFURT, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's two leading economic thinkers sparred on Thursday over how likely it was for the recent, sharp rise in euro zone inflation to become permanent. Philip Lane and Isabel Schnabel, who lead the economic debate on the ECB's board, both repeated the ECB's official line that the spike in price growth would ease next year as the effects of a post-pandemic bounce fade. But they differed sharply on the risks surrounding that prediction, with Schnabel warning of ""more persistent inflationary pressures"" and Lane of forces that could drag down price growth. ""It would be premature to assert that current price dynamics will fully subside next year,"" Schnabel told a joint conference organised by the ECB and the Cleveland Federal Reserve. ""There are several sources of uncertainty that might entail more persistent inflationary pressures."" Among them, she listed potential changes in inflation expectations and in people's behaviour when it comes to setting wages and prices. Speaking later at the same event, Lane refuted that the future was so uncertain. ""We should not be flying into a narrative of 'who knows?' 'uncertainty is so pervasive that we have no idea' - that's not the case,"" the ECB's chief economist said. ""There's very solid reasons to believe that a lot of this is to do with the reopening of the economy. There's very solid reasons to believe there's a significant transitory component."" He added that the recent rise in energy costs and the rollback of pandemic-related fiscal support measures were headwinds for the economy. Schnabel conceded that so far there was ""no indication"" in market prices and in economists' forecasts that higher inflation would become entrenched. But Lane went further, saying that the ECB wouldn't be spurred into tightening policy by a one-off increase in wages resulting from higher inflation this year. The ECB is widely expected to wind down its emergency bond purchases in March and the debate is now shifting to how much debt it will continue buying after that date under its regular programme. UPSIDE RISKS Accounts of the ECB's latest policy meeting showed on Thursday that policymakers had already started worrying about upside risks when they met on Sept. 9-10. ""Risks to the inflation outlook... were widely regarded as being tilted to the upside,"" the accounts stated, with policymakers arguing that the ECB must keep an eye on a possible inflation ""regime shift"". ECB chief Christine Lagarde played down inflation fears at a news conference after the meeting but has since struck a more balanced tone while many of her colleagues have flagged their concerns in private and public conversations. New ECB forecasts unveiled at the meeting put inflation at 2.2% this year, 1.7% next year and 1.5% in 2023. But policymakers at the gathering also wondered whether their projection models were working properly given the big inflation overshoots this year. ""This raised doubts about how well the models relied on in the projections were able to capture what was currently happening in the economy, the structural changes implied by the pandemic and the impact of the ECB?�s new monetary policy strategy,"" the ECB said. Inflation in the euro zone hit 3.4% in September, according to Eurostat flash estimate. EMERGENCY SUPPORT The rate setters also debated a bigger cut in the monthly pace of their Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and some policy hawks even argued that markets had already prepared for the end of PEPP without a significant impact on financing conditions. ""The argument was made that markets were already expecting an end to net asset purchases under the PEPP by March 2022,"" the accounts showed. ""The point was made that, even without the PEPP, the overall monetary policy stance remained highly accommodative."" In the end, the ECB opted for a more cautious move, simply deciding to cut their emergency bond buys ""moderately"" for fear of upsetting the markets.

business,Evergrande and other Chinese property giants have sizeable off-balance sheet debt - JPMorgan," LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Investment bank JPMorgan has estimated that troubled Chinese property giant Evergrande and many of its major rivals have billions of dollars worth of off-balance sheet debt that, once added on, ramp up their leverage ratios. JPMorgan's China and Hong Kong property analysts said the tactic is likely to have been used to help firms look like they were conforming with new borrowing cap rules introduced last year, but Evergrande's case looks the most extreme. ""Instead of true deleveraging, we think Evergrande has shifted some of the interest-bearing debt to off-balance sheet debt,"" JPMorgan's analysts said. ""Commercial papers, wealth management products and perpetual capital securities, etc, which are not officially counted as debt."" They estimated Evergrande's ""net gearing,"" as debt as a ratio of a firm's equity is known, was at least 177% at the end of the first half of the year, instead of the 100% its accounts reported. ""It is possible that the real gearing could be even higher, as data on some off-balance sheet debt is not publicly available,"" JPMorgan added, saying the ""disguised"" debt as it called it added up to 55% of Evergrande's overall debt.

business,BlackRock to give clients more say on holding companies to account," LONDON/BOSTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BlackRock - the world's largest money manager with $9.5 trillion in assets - typically casts the votes of shares on behalf of investors in its funds, making it one of Wall Street's most influential voices on matters ranging from corporate director elections to climate change and workforce diversity. From next year, however, certain institutional account holders will be able to vote themselves about 40% of the $4.8 trillion in assets held in BlackRock's equity index strategies, BlackRock said in a letter to clients. Others could choose to pick a third-party voting policy and use BlackRock to submit the votes. The changes could lead to companies finding it more difficult to push through their choices at shareholder votes because it will give more say to many institutional investors that often have tougher corporate governance voting policies, such as big pension funds and endowments, said Matt DiGuiseppe, vice president at corporate governance software firm Diligent. ""I expect this will have a significantly negative impact on the level of support that (a company's) management receives,"" DiGuiseppe said. Not all industry insiders agreed. Bruce Goldfarb, president of proxy solicitor Okapi Partners LLC, said he expected the changes would only have a marginal impact. ""I doubt many investors in BlackRock-managed products have policies that are too different from the well-crafted policies already set out by BlackRock and executed by its investment stewardship team,"" Goldfarb said. In any case the move makes business sense for BlackRock, said James McRitchie, a private investor who files many shareholder resolutions, as more investors look to the social impact of their portfolios. ""More people are viewing their investments as engagement mechanisms, not just bets on winning alpha,"" or higher returns, he said. The choice to cast a shareholder vote at companies would be offered in some index strategies held within separately managed accounts and certain pooled funds in Britain and the United States, BlackRock said. ""These options are designed to enable you to have a greater say in proxy voting, if that is important to you,"" BlackRock's letter said. BlackRock aims to add voting choices to more investment products, according to the letter. A massive surge of money into low-cost index funds has left BlackRock frequently owning 5% or more of top corporations. The firm and its rivals traditionally deferred to companies' recommendations on shareholder votes, though this has started to change. This year under a new stewardship chief, BlackRock opposed directors and backed climate resolutions more often, although it continued to support management pay 95% of the time at U.S. companies. Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, praised BlackRock's changes for allowing pension funds and other big asset owners to have more say over corporate decisions and said rival fund managers might move in a similar direction at least for U.S. investors. ""Big asset managers try to do a good job, but they're not the people I want running the country,"" Fisch said.

business,BlackRock to give clients more say on holding firms to account," LONDON/BOSTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, plans to give its clients more of a say on voting at company annual meetings, starting with a group holding nearly $2 trillion in assets. The move by New York-based BlackRock From next year, clients seeking more control will be able to vote according to their own policy and submit their votes using their own infrastructure, BlackRock said in a letter to clients which was seen by Reuters. Others could choose to pick a third-party voting policy and use BlackRock to submit the votes. The choice would be offered to institutional clients in some index strategies held within separately managed accounts and certain pooled funds in Britain and the United States. ""These options are designed to enable you to have a greater say in proxy voting, if that is important to you,"" it said, adding that the move was a response to a ""growing interest in investment stewardship"" among its clients. BlackRock's letter said the decision was the first in a series of steps to expand proxy voting options and followed several years of engagement with industry partners during which it had also developed new technology. ""It also reflects broader industry dynamics, such as the impact of advancing technology on investing ??and with it, the opportunity for more customized approaches to your investments and how you manage them,"" it added. Based on end-June data, around 40% of the $4.8 trillion in assets held in BlackRock's equity index strategies would be eligible to pick one of the options, it said, adding the ambition was to expand choice across more products. Larger clients whose assets are held within a separately managed account will also have the option to cherry pick which resolutions or companies on which to vote directly, using BlackRock to handle the process. For those happy to stick with the existing process, BlackRock said its own investment stewardship team would continue to vote proxies on their behalf. ""While offering clients more choice in how proxies are voted, BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) remains central to BlackRock?�s fiduciary approach,"" the letter said.

business,Fed's Mester says U.S. inflation mostly driven by pandemic-related factors," NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Both supply-side and demand-side factors are contributing to U.S. inflation right now, but most of the current price changes may be driven by pandemic-related shifts that could subside over time, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said on Thursday. Policymakers need to distinguish short-term inflationary pressures from inflation that could be longer lasting when determining how to respond, Mester said during a panel organized by the European Central Bank ""How much of that increase is driven by supply shocks and how much of it is driven by demand that would respond to monetary policy?"" Mester said. An increase in medium- and long-term inflation expectations, paired with a continued rise in inflation, could be a sign that the price changes are being driven more by higher demand than policymakers anticipate, said Mester. However, the Fed official, who will have a vote next year on the Fed's policy-setting committee, said that is not her baseline forecast. ""Right now, my view is it?�s pandemic related but we?�ll have to wait and see,"" said Mester. Some of the supply-side challenges caused by the pandemic may take longer to be resolved than initially expected and policymakers will keep an eye on those upside risks to inflation, Mester said. But there are consequences to responding too early, she said. ""Fundamentally, if it?�s supply-side driven, that?�s not something monetary policy should be responding to,"" Mester said, adding that officials should keep an eye on inflation expectations and other indicators to know if monetary policy is too accommodative or not providing enough accommodation. Fed officials have signaled they could begin reducing the U.S. central bank's $120 billion in monthly asset purchases Policymakers set a higher bar for raising interest rates, which Mester previously said could be met by the Our Standards: Authorities from Beijing to Delhi scrambled to fill a yawning power supply gap on Tuesday, triggering global stock and bond market wobbles on worries that rising energy costs will stoke inflation and curtail an economic recovery."
business,Italian watchdog calls on DAZN to fix Serie A live streaming problems," MILAN, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Italy's communications watchdog on Thursday called on sport streaming app DAZN to put measures in place in order to prevent malfunctions during streaming of live matches of the country's top soccer league Serie A, stepping up pressure on the online platform. Owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik, DAZN in March secured the rights to screen Serie A live matches for three seasons with a 2.5 billion euro ($2.89 billion) bid, under a technical and distribution partnership with Italy's biggest phone group Telecom Italia The deal, a major one for DAZN in Europe, marked also a major shift for Italy where live soccer, one of the most prized and popular content in the country, had been mostly distributed through satellite and digital terrestrial television platforms. However, since the start of the current season viewers complained about blockages and poor quality of the streaming while at least three major outages occurred during live matches, sparkling protests among users. AGCOM said DAZN must adopt all measures to prevent malfunctions of its video platform as well as developing an efficient customer care service in order to address reported services issues. The authority also said it had launched a procedure to define quality parameters for live streaming of matches of Italy's top flight soccer league and thresholds and criteria for possible compensation in case those were not met. DAZN said in a statement it has already shared with Italian authorities measures it had put in place to improve the service. ""We remain available to discuss with the watchdog in order to agree more efficient and fair solutions in the short term"", it added.

business,"Oil resumes rally, U.S. reserve release seen as unlikely"," BENGALURU, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Oil futures rebounded on Thursday, as the market deemed it unlikely that the United States would release emergency crude reserves or ban exports to ease tight supplies. Brent futures  rose 87 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $81.95 a barrel, while U.S. crude  gained 87 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $78.30 a barrel. Earlier in the day prices at both benchmarks dropped $2 a barrel. The U.S. Department of Energy said all ""tools are always on the table"" to tackle tight energy supply conditions in the market. The department made the comment amid questions about whether President Joe Biden's administration is considering tapping into its Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) or pursuing a ban on oil exports to bring down the cost of crude oil. Meanwhile, Biden's national security adviser urged energy suppliers to lift flows to meet demand, saying that the United States is concerned about their failure to do so. The United States has used its strategic reserves on occasion, usually after hurricanes or other supply disruptions. However, since ending a 40-year ban on crude exports in 2015, the nation has become a significant exporter, and has not broached cutting exports. Earlier this week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) agreed to raise output  only gradually, sending crude prices to multi-year highs. Oil markets have been on a steady rise due to tight supplies worldwide as demand recovered more quickly than expected from the COVID-19 pandemic in big import markets like China. ""The oil market is looking tighter in the short term, which suggests that prices will remain well supported until the end of the year,"" ING analyst Warren Patterson said in a note. Major producers and the International Energy Agency believe crude demand could rise by anywhere from 150,000 to 500,000 barrels per day in coming months as users of natural gas switch to oil due to high gas prices.

business,"Ireland agrees to global tax deal, sacrificing prized low rate"," DUBLIN, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Ireland dropped its opposition to an overhaul of global corporate tax rules on Thursday, agreeing to give up its prized 12.5% tax for large multinationals in a major boost to efforts to impose a minimum rate worldwide. Ireland, the low-tax European headquarters for blue chip companies including Apple An updated text this week dropped the ""at least"", clearing the way for ministers to do what successive governments said they would never contemplate - giving up the low rate that has helped win Ireland investments and jobs for decades. ""Joining this agreement is an important decision for the next stage of Ireland's industrial policy - a decision that will ensure that Ireland is part of the solution,"" Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told a news conference. ""This is a difficult and complex decision but I believe it is the right one."" All bar a handful of the 140 countries involved signed up to the July deal, brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), that marked the first rewriting of international tax rules in a generation. The holdouts, which include fellow EU members Estonia and Hungary, cannot block the proposed changes. The 140 negotiating countries are due to meet on Friday to finalise the deal. The U.S. Treasury, which had pressed Ireland to support the global minimum tax, hailed Dublin's decision as putting the world on a path toward a ""generational achievement"" to ensure corporations pay their fair share of taxes. If Ireland had maintained its lower rate, multinationals that book profits there could be forced to pay the additional tax elsewhere under the proposals. The government said it had received assurances from the European Commission that Ireland can maintain the 12.5% rate for firms with annual turnover below 750 million euros ($867 million) and keep tax incentives for research and development. The Commission also promised it will stick faithfully to the OECD agreement and not seek a higher rate among member states, Donohoe said. 'NO SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT' While Ireland wrestled with the prospective changes for months, it will not be the first change to its tax regime. A 10% tax rate convinced Apple to set up a manufacturing facility in the 1980s, with Microsoft The government increased this to 12.5% in 1997 to comply with EU state aid rules and multinational jobs mushroomed. The 12.5% rate was fiercely defended in the intervening years, most notably when Ireland came under pressure to raise it as part of a 2010 international bailout. Many analysts expect Ireland to remain competitive in the battle to attract foreign direct investment. Some 1,500 multinationals that will be hit by the higher rate currently employ around 400,000 people or one in six workers in Ireland, Donohoe said. ""We would be reasonably confident that this won't have a substantial impact,"" said Kieran McQuinn, research professor at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) think tank. ""As a country matures, other factors such as the flexibility of our workforce (and) membership of the EU tend to become very important as well,"" he added.

business,Brazil miner Vale sees no near-term spin-off of base metals unit," Oct 7 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Vale SA ""We are not talking about a spin off yet. The problem here is the size of the business,"" said Eduardo Bartolomeo, Vale's Chief Executive Officer as part of the Financial Times' Mining Summit. Vale had a longstanding plan to sell the unit, that was still being considered as recently as April of this year. The plan had first been developed in 2014, postponed to 2015, and then the idea was temporarily abandoned. Bartolomeo said part of the problem was the value of the business, saying it brings in $3.5 billion in revenue a year, which would put a sale value at ""more or less $25 billion."" To get to a spin-off, Vale said in a statement after the event, ""the business still needs to be adjusted, transformed, and go through an internal transformation."" Vale, one of the world's largest iron ore miners, is still dealing with the consequences of a dam burst in 2019, which killed 270 in the town of Brumadinho. Aside from the lives lost, the environmental damage, fines and complicated legal proceedings that targeted its top executives, the incident also depressed the company's value.

business,EXCLUSIVE US electronics firm struck deal to transport and hire Uyghur workers," QINZHOU, China, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. remote-control maker Universal Electronics Inc The Nasdaq-listed firm, which has sold its equipment and software to Sony, Samsung, LG, Microsoft and other tech and broadcast companies, has employed at least 400 Uyghur workers from the far-western region of Xinjiang as part of an ongoing worker-transfer agreement, according to the company and local officials in Qinzhou and Xinjiang, government notices and local state media. In at least one instance, Xinjiang authorities paid for a charter flight that delivered the Uyghur workers under police escort from Xinjiang's Hotan city - where the workers are from - to the UEI plant, according to officials in Qinzhou and Hotan interviewed by Reuters. The transfer is also described in a notice posted on an official Qinzhou police social media account in February 2020 at the time of the transfer. Responding to Reuters' questions about the transfer, a UEI spokeswoman said the company currently employs 365 Uyghur workers at the Qinzhou plant. It said it treated them the same as other workers in China and said it did not regard any of its employees as forced labor. Sony Group Corp Sony declined to comment on specific suppliers. In a statement to Reuters, it said if any supplier is confirmed to have committed a major violation of its code of conduct, which prohibits the use of forced labor, then ""Sony will take appropriate countermeasures including request for implementing corrective actions and termination of business with such supplier."" A Microsoft spokesperson said the company takes action against any supplier that violates its code of conduct, up to termination of its business relationship, but that UEI was no longer an active supplier. ""We have not used hardware from the supplier since 2016 and have had no association with the factory in question,"" the spokesperson said. A Samsung spokesman said the company prohibits its suppliers from using all forms of forced labor and requires that all employment be freely chosen. He declined to comment on UEI. LG did not reply to requests for comment. The UEI spokeswoman said the company covers the cost of the transfer of workers to its Qinzhou plant from a local airport or train station in Guangxi, the region in which Qinzhou is located. She said the company does not know how the workers are trained in Xinjiang or who pays for their transport to Guangxi. Reuters was unable to interview plant workers and therefore was not able to determine whether they are being compelled to work at UEI. The conditions they face, however, bear hallmarks of standard definitions of forced labor, such as working in isolation, under police guard and with restricted freedom of movement. UEI's Uyghur workers are under surveillance by police during their transportation and life at the factory, where they eat and sleep in segregated quarters, according to details in Qinzhou government notices and local state media. Programs like this have transferred thousands of Uyghur laborers to factories in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, citing leaked Chinese government documents and testimony from detainees who say they were forced into such jobs, say the programs are coercive and part of China's overall plan to control the majority-Uyghur population in the region. In response to Reuters' questions, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not address employment at UEI, but denied forced labor exists anywhere in the country. ""This so-called 'forced labor' is a completely fabricated lie,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Xinjiang migrant workers in other parts of China, like all workers, enjoy the right to employment in accordance with the law. The right to sign a labor contract, the right to labor remuneration, the right to rest and vacation, the right to labor safety and health protection, the right to obtain insurance and welfare rights and other legal rights."" Xinjiang authorities did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. Department of State, which has criticized China and several other governments for condoning forced labor, said the United States has found ""credible reports of state-sponsored forced labor practices employed by the (Chinese) government in Xinjiang, as well as situations of forced labor involving members of these groups outside Xinjiang."" A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on UEI, but said wittingly benefiting from forced labor in the United States was a crime under the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act. That law ""criminalizes the act of knowingly benefiting, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture, where the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the venture engaged in forced labor,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. The law imposes criminal liability on individuals or entities present in the United States, the statement added, even when the forced labor occurs in another country. The State Department referred Reuters to the Justice Department for further comment on UEI; Justice did not respond. The import of goods into the United States made wholly or in part by forced labor is also a crime under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. UEI told Reuters ""a very small quantity"" of products made at its Qinzhou factory are exported to the United States. It did not specify who purchases the goods. The law is enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which can seize imports and start a criminal investigation of the importer. Customs said it does not comment on whether specific entities are under investigation. Legal experts told Reuters there have been very few forced labor prosecutions in the United States over abuses overseas, given the difficulty of proving an offense. ""As the law currently stands, there's very little that the U.S. government can do to hold American companies accountable when they build, manage and profit from supply chains that engage in forced labor and other human rights abuses outside the United States,"" said David McKean, deputy director of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, a coalition of rights groups. Legislation before the U.S. Congress, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, was designed to toughen up restrictions by creating the legal presumption that any products made in Xinjiang are the result of forced labor, putting the burden on importers to prove they are not. The latest version of the legislation was passed by the Senate this year but has yet to pass the House of Representatives. The UEI spokeswoman told Reuters the company does not conduct independent due diligence on where and how its workers are trained in Xinjiang. She said the arrangement is vetted by a third-party agent working with the Xinjiang government, who brokered the deal. She declined to identify that agent. Reuters could not determine if the agent is independent or works for the Xinjiang government. 'VOCATIONAL' INTERNMENT CAMPS China has detained over 1 million Uyghurs in a system of camps since 2017 as part of what it calls an anti-extremism campaign, according to estimates by researchers and United Nations experts. China describes internment camps in the region as vocational education and training centers and denies accusations of rights abuses. Organized transfers of Uyghur laborers to other parts of China date back to the early 2000s, according to state media and government notices from the time. The program has expanded since about 2016, Xinjiang officials said in late July, around the time the mass internment program began. Xinjiang officials told reporters at a Beijing media conference in late July that transfers of workers outside of Xinjiang are common and voluntary. ""There are many labor-intensive industries that fit the skills of people in Xinjiang,"" said Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the provincial government. ""They go where the market needs them."" Suppliers for some U.S. companies have been accused of using forced laborers transported from Xinjiang. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think tank, last year released a report identifying 83 brands linked to Uyghur labor transfer programs, citing Chinese-language documents, satellite-imagery analysis and media reports. None of the U.S. companies were directly involved in the transfers, however. Aside from remote-control technology, UEI also makes home security products under the Ecolink brand. It has more than 3,800 employees in 30 countries and a market value of about $670 million. Its headquarters are in Scottsdale, Arizona, but the company has no plants in the United States. The company's two largest investors are funds run by BlackRock Inc and Eagle Asset Management, an affiliate of Carillon Tower Advisers. BlackRock declined to comment. A spokesman for Eagle Asset Management said: ""Since becoming aware of purported labor issues involving one of our investments, we immediately approached the company's senior leadership and they have provided assurances that labor is paid, treated humanely and employed at-will. Should we learn otherwise, we will take appropriate action."" GOVERNMENT FUNDING Six groups of workers were transported from Xinjiang to the UEI factory between May 2019 and February 2020, according to Qinzhou government notices, confirmed to Reuters by government officials in Xinjiang and Guangxi. In early 2020, as the new coronavirus began to spread in China and lockdowns crippled manufacturing, about 1,300 Uyghurs were transported from Xinjiang?�s southern Hotan region. They were sent to factories around the country to alleviate labor shortages and help get them running again, according to officials cited by Chinese state media outlet Economic Daily in February 2020. The police-escorted charter flights were funded by the Xinjiang government, according to Qinzhou government notices and an official in Hotan who spoke to Reuters in May. UEI?�s Qinzhou factory took more than 100 workers in the February 2020 transfer, according to notices on the Qinzhou government website, state media and Qinzhou officials. That was one of several transfers made under an agreement struck some nine months earlier between UEI and Xinjiang authorities. Reuters could not determine exactly where the workers came from. UEI?�s operation underscores the role played by agents in supplying companies with Uyghur workers. The UEI spokeswoman confirmed the company entered into an agreement with Xinjiang authorities in 2019 after being approached by the third-party agent. UEI said the same agent hires and pays the workers and that UEI does not sign individual contracts with the workers. The spokeswoman declined to disclose what the Uyghur workers are paid, beyond saying that they receive the same as others at the facility, which is ""higher than Qinzhou local minimum wage."" The Economic Daily reported that workers sent in UEI's February 2020 transfer are expected to make around 3,000 yuan ($465) a month. That compares with the average manufacturing wage in the province of Guangxi of 3,719 yuan, according to China?�s national bureau of statistics. UEI's Uyghur employees are part of a much bigger system. Two separate labor agents hired by Hotan and Kashgar authorities in Xinjiang told Reuters they had each been set targets of placing as many as 20,000 Uyghurs annually with companies outside the region. They, and one other agent, showed Reuters copies of three contracts for transfers already completed this year. These included a January contract to transport 1,000 workers to an auto parts factory in Xiaogan, Hubei province, who had to undergo ""political screening"" prior to transfer. The three agents told Reuters that separate dormitories, police escorts and payments overseen by third-party agents are routine elements in such transfers. ""Uyghur workers are the most convenient workers for companies,"" one of the agents told Reuters. ""Everything is managed by the government."" The Uyghurs of UEI are kept under tight watch all along this labor-supply chain. Photographs published online by the Economic Daily and an official social media account of Qinzhou police, dated Feb. 28, 2020, show the workers lining up before dawn outside the airport in the city of Hotan before taking the flight. ""Get to work quickly and get rich through hard work using both hands,"" one manager employed by Xinjiang authorities told the gathered workers, according to an account published online by the Qinzhou Daily. Accompanying photos show the workers dressed in blue and red uniforms. More than a dozen uniformed police officers escorted the same workers through the Nanning Wuxu airport and onto buses, according to posts on a social media account of a Qinzhou police unit and a post by the Qinzhou government. The buses were then escorted by police vehicles to the UEI factory in Qinzhou, some 75 miles (120 km) away. SEPARATE DORMS, POLICE ?�EDUCATION??The mostly young Uyghur laborers at UEI?�s plant sleep in separate dormitories and eat in a segregated canteen under the watch of managers assigned by Xinjiang authorities. Non-Uyghur laborers are not subject to such monitoring. The managers stay with the Uyghur workers throughout their employment, according to state media, local police notices and government officials who spoke to Reuters. UEI said the canteens were established to provide local Uyghur food, and says it allows Xinjiang workers to share dormitories ""as they wish."" The Uyghurs must participate in what are described as ""education activities"" run by Qinzhou police and judicial authorities within the UEI facility, as part of the agreement between the U.S. firm and local authorities, according to notices on the government website of the Qinzhou district where UEI's factory is located. Reuters could not determine what those activities involve. Beijing has said that legal education is a key aspect of the training programs in Xinjiang's camps. The education activities in UEI?�s factory only apply to the Uyghur workers, according to two Qinzhou government notices. The UEI spokeswoman said UEI is ""not aware of specific legal education activities"" that Uyghurs take part in at its plant. 'TERRORISTS, XINJIANG PEOPLE AND MENTAL PATIENTS' Two Reuters journalists visited the Qinzhou factory in April during a local public holiday when the plant was not running. Women in Uyghur ethnic dress were visible inside the compound. Half a dozen police arrived, followed by a delegation of officials from the Qinzhou Foreign Affairs Office. The officials confirmed that Uyghur laborers worked in the factory, which is run by UEI's wholly owned China subsidiary Gemstar Technology. The officials said Gemstar had taken the lead in setting up the May 2019 agreement to transfer workers. The officials told Reuters not to take photos of Uyghurs in the factory. The district of Qinzhou where UEI is located has surveillance measures targeting Uyghurs that predate the transfers. A June 2018 procurement document seen by Reuters shows police there purchased a 4.3 million yuan ($670,000) system that establishes blacklists of ""high-risk"" people. These include ""terrorists, Xinjiang people and mental patients."" The document also lists a specific need for ""automatic alarms"" - a computer system that sends alerts via an internal messaging system to police when Uyghurs from Xinjiang are detected in the area. According to a March 2020 post on the official Qinzhou police website, UEI agreed to provide daily reports on the workers to police.

business,Ukrainian airline ditches skirts and heels for loose suits and sneakers," KYIV, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Alexandrina Denysenko, a senior flight attendant with seven years of experience, says she sometimes does not get a spare minute to sit down during a flight and dreams of resting her swollen legs after spending hours wearing heels. SkyUp Airlines, the privately-owned Ukrainian carrier that  employs Denysenko, decided to put an end to heels and pencil skirts after collecting feedback from flight attendants about their uniform. The new SkyUp uniform for women now includes white Nike sneakers and a loose orange suit with trousers and a silk scarf, both made by Ukrainian brands. White T-shirts will replace blouses. ""Shoes on heels look beautiful, I do not argue with that, but feet suffer and swell by the end of the flight. Sneakers are absolutely cool,"" Denysenko told Reuters. ""God forbid, but if a crew has to do a landing in water and an evacuation, heels can damage the ladder and it won't be very comfortable to swim in a skirt,"" she said. The company said they researched the history of cabin crew uniforms and decided to ditch what they called ""conservative"" elements of a flight attendant's look. Braids will now replace a tight-bun or pony-tail hairstyle. ""We found out that despite the fact that the image of a female flight attendant is very romanticized, their job demands a lot of physical training,"" the head of the SkyUp Airlines marketing department, Marianna Grygorash, said. The new uniform will be officially launched on Oct. 22. Grygorash said the company also plans to launch a new uniform for male crew. A light suit instead of a vest, and a T-shirt instead of a shirt will be combined with black Nike sneakers. ""If the whole world and all fashionistas wear sneakers, why not to bring it to aviation?"" flight attendant Zoryana said.

business,Analysis: Fed ready to handle September jobs report with kid gloves," Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. hiring probably accelerated last month, a range of high-frequency indicators suggests, as the effects of the latest COVID-19 surge began to subside, but even a second straight weak employment report would be unlikely to derail the Federal Reserve's plans to begin reducing its support for the economy. Ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's release on Friday of the nonfarm payrolls report for September, data from firms tracking work patterns signals an outcome in line with the median estimate of a gain of 500,000 jobs in a Reuters poll of economists. And that may be more than enough. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month there was broad agreement among policymakers to begin reducing the U.S. central bank's $120 billion in monthly asset purchases as soon as November, as long as the September U.S. jobs report, in Powell's words, is ""decent."" Even the Fed's most dovish policymakers - Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans - have indicated their willingness to go along with that timeline for paring back the quantitative easing put in place last year to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. ""We think the bar for QE tapering will be met as long as the payroll print is above zero,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Boussour forecasts that 384,000 jobs were gained last month. The path to normalizing monetary policy cleared further on Thursday after U.S. lawmakers reached a temporary deal to raise the federal government's debt limit. The move averts a potential debt default later this month that would have forced the Fed back into crisis-fighting mode. The latest surge in U.S. coronavirus cases peaked in mid-September. Estimates are mixed on how much of a damper that had on job growth during the month. The lowest estimate in the Reuters poll is for an overall gain of 250,000 jobs in September; the highest is 700,000. The ADP National Employment Report, which has a poor track record of predicting the broader Labor Department's report but provides some clues, on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased 568,000 last month, beating economists' expectations, as restaurants and other in-person businesses resumed hiring. Payroll data from A report this week from payroll management firm UKG showed the number of shifts worked by U.S. employees stabilized in September after falling in August. That's broadly consistent with economists' current estimates of job growth last month, UKG Vice President Dave Gilbertson said. Shifts worked in the leisure and hospitality sectors fell during the month, likely due to workers opting out of in-person jobs when possible due to concerns about the virus. And work in manufacturing, Gilbertson noted, rose less than usual for September, likely reflecting supply chain bottlenecks and potentially auguring poorly for the retail sector during the upcoming holiday season. ""We know for sure it (job growth in September) didn't accelerate in the way people were hoping it would accelerate, but we can also be pretty confident in saying this was not a crash,"" he said. VIRUS ECONOMY Forecasts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest daily COVID-19 infections will continue to fall in coming weeks. Most economists expect that would allow job gains to accelerate further as the year progresses. Jefferies economist Aneta Markowska expects Friday's report to show an overall gain of 300,000 jobs and a decline in leisure and retail jobs, reflecting some people's reluctance to work in high-contact jobs during the recent upswing in COVID-19 cases. Markowska, however, expects that trend to likely reverse in the face of the drop in cases.

business,'Containergeddon': Supply crisis drives Walmart and rivals to hire their own ships," LOS ANGELES, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Flying Buttress once glided across the oceans carrying vital commodities like grain to all corners of the world. Now it bears a different treasure: Paw Patrol Movie Towers, Batmobile Transformers and Baby Alive Lulu Achoo dolls. The dry bulk cargo ship has been drafted into the service of retail giant Walmart ALSO READ: ""Chartering vessels is just one example of investments we've made to move products as quickly as possible,"" said Joe Metzger, U.S. executive vice president of supply-chain operations at Walmart, which has hired a number of vessels this year. The aim is to bypass log-jammed ports and secure scarce ship space at a time when COVID-19, as well as U.S.-China trade ructions, equipment shortages and extreme weather, have exposed the fragility of the globe-spanning supply lines we use for everything from food and fashion to drinks and diapers. ALSO READ: More than 60 container ships carrying clothing, furniture and electronics worth billions of dollars are stuck outside Los Angeles and Long Beach terminals, waiting to unload, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California. Pre-pandemic, it was unusual for more than one ship to be in the waiting lane at the No. 1 U.S. port complex, which handles more than half of all American imports. Other big retail players, such as Target Or, as Steve Ferreira of shipping consultancy Ocean Audit describes the escalating concern: ""Containergeddon."" ALSO READ: U.S. retailers' traditional lifeline from Asia is freezing up due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia plus a power-supply crunch in China. The supply snarls coincide with booming demand as consumers spend more on goods than going out, and the festive shopping frenzy nears. Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, said at least 20-25% of the goods stuck on ships were unlikely to make it onto shelves in time for the Nov. 26 Black Friday kickoff for the holiday shopping season, a period when retailers make more than a third of their profits. ROUTE FOR GREAT PROFIT The biggest chains are taking matters into their own hands. In a typical year, Walmart would have moved those toys from China to Los Angeles in hundreds of 40-foot (12-metre) cargo boxes stacked like colorful Lego bricks on gigantic container vessels that serve multiple customers. But 2021 is far from typical. Incoming cargo at the Port of Los Angeles is up 30% from last year's record levels. Trucks and trains can't remove it fast enough, leading to logjams, said the port's Executive Director Gene Seroka, reflecting the surge in consumer demand. ""It's like taking 10 lanes of freeway traffic and squeezing them into five,"" Seroka said. Chartered ships that offer valuable cargo space and can sidestep the container terminals play a critical role in this second pandemic holiday season, particularly for time-sensitive goods like Christmas sweaters that won't sell if they arrive too late. The Flying Buttress, for example, entered Los Angeles waters on Aug. 21. It got stuck in a queue outside the port before it bypassed clogged terminals and unloaded its goods at a separately operated bulk cargo dock nearby on Aug. 31, according to Refinitiv data and shipping records. During that voyage, Walmart circumvented the shortage of 40-foot containers typically used for global shipping by switching to bigger 53-foot containers that are almost exclusively used to move goods by truck and train within the United States. Other companies are also playing the shipping game including Home Depot which said it was ""creatively working to obtain additional capacity"". The home improvement retailer dodged the Los Angeles gridlock by sending its Great Profit charter ship nearly 125 miles south to the Port of San Diego. On Sept. 15, the ship's onboard cranes hoisted 7-foot Halloween ""Spellcasting witches"", Christmas lights and other holiday decor onto docks there, said Ocean Audit CEO Ferreira, who helps shipping customers claw back overpayments. ""This is the home stretch. They're doing whatever it takes"" to win in an overheated market, he said of retailers. WHY PORT SIZE MATTERS Yet there is a limit to such workarounds. Great Profit moored at a terminal that handles everything from sugar to windmill blades but can only accommodate a maximum of 500 containers from one to two ships per month between now and the end of the year, said Greg Borossay, the port's maritime business development principal. That's because San Diego, like many other U.S. seaports, doesn't have the towering gantry cranes needed to pluck boxes from massive ships. Rail service is equipped for autos and other specialty cargo. And, roads in surrounding commercial and residential areas aren't set up for the fleets of trucks needed to whisk thousands of containers to other parts of the country. ""We'd have a very unhappy community if we had 3,000 (boxes) coming off a ship,"" Borossay added. Not all retailers will hire ships to support sales, and other factors could be significant in picking out potential winners and losers. Clothing and accessory retailers have seen their inventories decline even as sales have accelerated, stoking worries about sell-outs, said Jason Miller, associate professor of logistics at Michigan State University's business college. General merchandise retailers like Walmart and Target, on the other hand have done a better job of keeping inventory on pace with sales, he added. PAYING $20,000 PER CONTAINER The global supply crunch is providing lucrative opportunities for bulk cargo ship operators, though; they are cashing in on a record spike in container shipping rates that has sent freight costs above $20,000 per box on the biggest liner vessels. Global container shipping players like AP Moller Maersk Several shipping sources said other firms were snapping up second-hand container vessels of all sizes. Hong Kong-based Taylor Maritime, which according to shipping databases manages the Flying Buttress, did not respond to a request for comment. Dry bulk transporters have a short window of time to prepare decks to safely secure and carry cargo boxes. They typically transport commodities in below-deck cargo holds. Genco Shipping & Trading Genco isn't going all-in on container shipping, said CEO John Wobensmith, who called the project ""opportunistic"". Separately, agribusiness giant Cargill [RIC:RIC:CARG.UL] said it is looking into using some of the dry bulk ships it charters to instead hold containers, if only as a temporary solution, to ""alleviate bottlenecks"".

business,"Conagra flags price increases to cushion inflation impact, raises sales forecast"," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Conagra Brands Inc Packaged food companies are grappling with inflation as the U.S. economy rebounds, while spending heavily on freight and logistics to ease the strain on their supply chains due to the pandemic. Conagra said it was facing rising costs of ingredients including edible oils, proteins and grains forcing it to increase prices on frozen goods by 3.5% and on staple meals by 3.3%. The company makes Marie Callender's pulled pork mac and cheese bowls and Healthy Choice meals. Higher prices did not dissuade shoppers and the impact on demand had so far been ""limited,"" Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said, pointing to the company's upbeat quarterly results.

The company raised its full-year outlook for organic net sales, citing a stronger-than-expected consumer demand and additional pricing actions, accounting for elevated inflation levels. It raised its full-year gross inflation estimates to around 11% from about 9% forecast earlier. The company expects full-year sales growth of about 1% compared with its previous forecast of about flat growth. Net sales fell 1% to $2.65 billion in the first quarter, edging past analysts' expectations of $2.54 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

business,Analysis: Will Washington truce stick? Wall St assesses U.S. debt ceiling risk," Oct 7 (Reuters) - An apparent truce in the U.S. The heads of major banks and financial institutions A plan floated by U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday would extend the borrowing limit into December -- providing respite but no long-term solution. ""There will be many proposals, trial balloons and negotiations going on to resolve this issue,"" said S&P Global Ratings' lead U.S. sovereign credit analyst Joydeep Mukherji in an email on Wednesday, adding that S&P's view on the U.S. underlying credit rating has not changed. Mukherji in a recent interview said the scenario of the AA-plus Markets reacted positively ""Two months seems like plenty of time and (we) think the debt ceiling would be raised through reconciliation by then and do not expect to experience the past week come December,"" NatWest analysts wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Republicans said Democrats could use the intervening weeks to pass a longer debt-ceiling extension through a complex process called reconciliation, which would allow Democrats to marshal their razor-thin majority in the Senate to approve the measure without any Republican support. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote on Wednesday that the ultimate outcome may be ""what had seemed like the most likely outcome all along, which is that Democrats use the reconciliation process to increase the debt limit just before the deadline"" after exhausting all other options. Even so, there are serious risks for President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats. Under the temporary extension plan, Democrats would have to address the debt ceiling issue again in December, just as another federal government shutdown looms. That could complicate their efforts to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of Biden's domestic agenda. Mike O?�Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, wrote in a note to clients that he expected McConnell to ""continue to grant limited debt limit extensions right through the (2022) mid-term elections if the lack of urgency continues to slow the Democrats' reconciliation spending bill."" STAKES HIGH The stakes are high if a solution is not reached. Financial risk firm Moody's Analytics, which is a separate entity from Moody's Investors Service, said a default would be a ""catastrophic blow"" to the U.S. economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and upend global financial markets. Moody's Analytics noted that an inadvertent missed Treasury bill payment in 1979 caused bill yields to spike 60 basis points and remain elevated for several months at the cost of tens of billions of dollars. The The major credit rating agencies do not expect the U.S. will default. Still, Mukherji and his counterpart at Fitch Ratings in recent research and interviews said a default, including a temporary or so-called technical one, on any Treasury bill, note or bond payment would push the country's respective ratings of AA-plus and AAA down to D. Moody's Investors Service, which rates the U.S. Aaa with a stable outlook, said it saw a ""limited"" impact on the country's rating in the case of a default and would likely Even without a default, if a solution is not in hand to avoid a cash crunch the United States risks losing another of its triple-A ratings. S&P famously cut the rating a notch to AA-plus on Aug. 5, 2011, in the wake of a round of political wrangling over the country's debt. Major financial institutions have considered the United States an AA-plus-rated credit since October 2020, down from AAA where it stood since 2017, according to David Carruthers, head of research at Credit Benchmark, a financial data and analytics company that collates the internal credit risk views of more than 40 institutions around the world, including 15 global systemically important banks. Mukherji in an interview last week said that a U.S. default on a debt payment would be highly unusual as it would be a result of politics and not economic woes. Still, at the end of the day it's the same thing. ""If you don't pay, it really doesn't matter what the reason was -- you are in default.""

business,Sparkling Champagne sales ease gloom over ravaged vineyard," PARIS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Champagne sales are set to reach a four-year high this year, driven by strong exports to the United States and Australia, champagne wine growers lobby SGV said on Thursday, adding that Brexit and a row with Russia had not hit volumes. The forecast should cheer wine producers that face their worst output in 40 years in 2021 after vineyards were ravaged by frosts and mildew fungus attacks. The industry also suffered from the closure of bars and restaurants during the pandemic. But in 2021, the progressive reopening of markets and an economic upturn will likely allow sales to rebound to 305 million bottles of 75 centilitres. That compares with 297 million in 2019, before COVID-19 and a year taken as a benchmark by SGV. ""In winemakers' memory we never had such a complicated year in terms of harvest but things are much better on the trade front,"" SGV Chairman Maxime Toubart told reporters. The recovery was led by exports with sales between January and August jumping 11.9% compared to the same period in 2019 while they fell 2.4% within France. Champagne is typically made from a combination of wines produced the previous year and earlier. The estimates are a total from wine growers and large champagne houses such as family-run Taittinger, LVMH's Britain's exit from the European Union in 2020 led to more paperwork but did not affect champagne sales, the SGV said. Neither did a Russian law forcing foreign champagne producers to add a ""sparkling wine"" reference to the back of their bottles.

business,Cemex sees double-digit U.S. price hikes as supply chain snags weigh," MEXICO CITY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Mexican concrete giant Cemex said on Thursday that supply chain snags and project delays will squeeze its full-year operating profit, even as it plans double-digit U.S. price hikes to offset higher costs. Together with inflation and foreign exchange effects, the snags and delays could hit earnings this year by around $100 million, its chief executive said in a presentation for investorsand analysts.

Cemex  will report third-quarter results at the end of the month with more detailed information on the impact to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Gonzalez said, adding that the company was also aiming to delay costs and some investments. ""There is a scarcity of certain goods,"" he said. ""We've needed to buy at spot prices... that's more expensive than we're prepared to spend."" Jaime Muguiro, president of Cemex's U.S. operations, said the company would hike U.S. prices by double-digits throughout the coming year, in part to offset higher energy and shipping costs.

Alberto challenged the will in a New York court in August, asking for medical records to prove his father, who was Brazil's richest man when he died in December 2020 aged 82, was in poor health when he last changed his will in 2019. He argued in court that he had been disinherited, a characterization disputed by his mother Vicky Safra, administrator of Joseph Safra's state, according to a document filed with the court. Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo first reported the ongoing negotiations between Alberto and his family. Alberto and his siblings declined to comment on this and other financial matters. Alberto resigned from Banco Safra's board of directors in November 2019, after a dispute with his younger brother David. Alberto said at the time he would launch his own bank, ASA Bank. But Alberto reviewed his plans and has instead opened an asset manager, ASA Investments. Before challenging his father's will in court, Alberto had disagreed with dividend policy at the family's holding company.

""The advantages associated with this more efficient and flexible organisation should contribute to securing jobs in the long-term,"" the spokesperson told Reuters. The news, reported first by German newspaper Handelsblatt, comes after unions expressed concern that the Eisenach plant could be shut down permanently after the company said it would be closed for three months due to the global chip shortage. Workers at the plant on Thursday accused Stellantis Union officials fear that Opel, which is bound by an agreement struck last year not to make any workers in Germany redundant until 2025, is placing workers at the Eisenach plant on furlough as a temporary fix that could evolve into a longer-term shutdown. Until the shutdown is lifted, the Grandland X model being produced in Eisenach will be made at the company's Sochaux plant in France - but Eisenach workers fear it will be moved there permanently. ""We won't let this be done to us,"" local workers' council head Uwe Loesche wrote in a statement published on union IG Metall's website on Thursday. Two unions in France last week issued a similar critique of Stellantis' use of the furlough scheme, alleging that the company was using the chip shortage as an excuse to furlough a disproportionate number of people. ""The global automotive industry is in an exceptional situation due to the ongoing pandemic and a global shortage of semiconductors,"" Stellantis said in an emailed statement to Reuters when asked about the union's concerns. ""Production in Eisenach is scheduled to start again at the beginning of 2022, provided the supply chain situation allows."" Stellantis' Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, alongside other heads of automakers and industry experts, predict the chip crisis will carry on well into 2022. Analysts have said that the company, which is the world's fourth largest carmaker, has an overcapacity problem that could lead to plant shutdowns, though CEO Tavares has promised that his endeavours to turn around Opel's profits would not involve factory closures.

business,World food prices hit 10-year peak -FAO," PARIS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - World food prices rose for a second consecutive month in September to reach a 10-year peak, driven by gains for cereals and vegetable oils, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday. The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also projected record global cereal production in 2021, but said this would be outpaced by forecast consumption. FAO's food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 130.0 points last month, the highest reading since September 2011, according to the agency's data. The figure compared with a revised 128.5 for August. The August figure was previously given as 127.4. On a year-on-year basis, prices were up 32.8% in September. Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, fuelled by harvest setbacks and Chinese demand. The ""Among major cereals, wheat will be the focus in the coming weeks as demand need to be tested against fast rising prices,??FAO Senior Economist Abdolreza Abbassian said in a statement. World vegetable oil prices were up 1.7% on the month and showing a year-on-year rise of about 60%, as palm oil prices climbed on robust import demand and concerns over labour shortages in Malaysia, FAO said. Palm oil futures have rallied further in early October to hit record highs as a surge in crude oil markets has lent further support to vegetable oils used in biodiesel. Global sugar prices rose 0.5% in September with concern over adverse crop weather in top exporter Brazil partly offset by slowing import demand and a favourable production outlook in India and Thailand, according to FAO. For cereal production, FAO projected a record world crop of 2.800 billion tonnes in 2021, up slightly from 2.788 billion  estimated a month ago. That would be below world cereal use of 2.811 billion tonnes, a forecast revised up by 2.7 million tonnes from a month earlier mainly to reflect increased wheat use inanimal feed, FAO said in a Global cereal stocks were expected to ease in 2021/22 but would still be at a comfortable level, FAO added.

business,Skoda Auto sees more pain from chip shortage in blow to Czech economy," PRAGUE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Skoda Auto, a Volkswagen unit and the Czech Republic's biggest exporter, will ""significantly reduce or even halt"" production from Oct. 18 until the end of the year due to the global shortage of chips hobbling the automotive sector. Carmakers around the world are struggling with a lack of semiconductor chips amid a post-pandemic rise in demand, and the disruption is hampering the Czech economy and others in central Europe reliant on the auto industry. ""Not even Skoda Auto is able to avoid this global crisis,"" Skoda Auto spokesman Tomas Kotera said. The expected production curbs are the biggest so far in central Europe, and economists said they would lead to a cut in Czech growth forecasts. Skoda, the backbone of the country's car sector that employs 180,000 workers and makes up quarter of industrial output, has already stocked up tens of thousands of cars finished but awaiting chips. Dealerships are reporting months-long waits for new cars. Kotera said the firm wanted to focus on getting the backlog of almost finished cars to customers as soon as possible. Due to Skoda's outage, overall car production should be similar this year to the 1.15 million cars made in the ""covid"" year 2020, the Czech Automotive Industry Association said. Previously, the association expected 1.3 million cars to be produced this year. Skoda, which employs 35,000 and said it remained committed to maintaining jobs, predicted a gradual calming of the situation for chips in the second half of 2022. The uncertainty in the car industry is becoming a major drag around central Europe, forcing economies to rely more on a rebound in services or household spending to drive growth. Data on Thursday showed Czech industrial output fell in August year-on-year for the first time since February amid a sharp drop in car production due to extended holidays. Hungary, where carmakers likes Mercedes and Suzuki have had to limit some production, also saw output growth shrink more than expected because of the car sector. Output in Germany, the region's key trade partner, slumped in August. The Czech Republic is home to three car manufacturers. Besides Skoda, which also halted production at the end of September, Toyota has faced outages, including last month. ""Automotive is not getting out of the trenches just yet, and that means bad news for the whole industrial sector, and that actually means bad news for GDP (gross domestic product),"" Raiffeisen analyst Vit Hradil said, adding he would look to revise his forecast for roughly 3% economic growth this year.

European bourses rallied off 2-1/2-month lows and Wall Street jumped as steady crude oil and natural gas prices offered relief after a shock 4% drop in German industrial production highlighted supply chain disruptions. German output of cars and auto parts slid 17.5% in August due to supply shortages of intermediate products, providing a telling sign of the constraints posed by the combination of rising inflation and moribund growth, or stagflation. But the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell the most in three months last week, suggesting the U.S. labor market recovery was regaining momentum after a recent slowdown as COVID-19 infections subside. Stagflation fears are overdone, and investors are overly focused on weaker economic growth and higher inflation though the long-term market trend is higher, said Bill Sterling, global strategist at GW&K Investment Management.

business,Evergrande backer Chinese Estates' stock soars on take-private offer," HONG KONG, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Chinese Estates Holdings The Hong Kong developer said on Wednesday the family of Chinese Estates' biggest shareholder, Joseph Lau, had proposed to take it private by offering minority shareholders a 38% premium to its last traded price. The offer represents the latest move by Lau and China Estates to emerge from the shadow of Evergrande, which is floundering due to a huge debt load and threatening the Hong Kong company's future. Formerly Evergrande's second-biggest shareholder, Chinese Estates has already slashed its holding over the past few months to 4.39% from 6.48%. It has flagged a goal to exit the holding completely and estimates a loss of HK$10.41 billion for the current year from the stake disposal. Eugene Law, business development director of China Galaxy International Financial, said as a listed company Chinese Estates would need to keep updating on its position in Evergrande and ""it does not want that trouble"". Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling. Chinese Estates' shares rose to HK$3.81 by noon. They resumed trading on Thursday after being suspended on Sept. 29. Shares of the Hong Kong developer were down 42% this year before the trading suspension, dragged down by unrealized losses in its investment in Evergrande whose stock took a hit due to liquidity crisis and default risks. In a statement late on Wednesday, Chinese Estates said its stock price may be further affected by Evergrande, as it is ""cautious and concerned"" about recent developments at the Chinese developer. A delisting would reduce the costs and management resources to maintain the listing status, Chinese Estates added, and it could provide more flexibility to implement long-term business strategies. Other than Evergrande, Chinese Estates said it also has significant investments in another Chinese developer, Kaisa Group Chinese Estates' former chairman Lau has been a major backer of Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan and is a member of the so-called ""poker club"" of Hong Kong tycoons that includes Hui. Lau, whose family owns about 75% of Chinese Estates' equity capital, resigned as its chairman and chief executive in 2014 after he was found guilty of bribery and money laundering charges in the gambling hub of Macau.

business,Marketmind: Politicians weigh in," Oct 7 - A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni. For once, it wasn't central bankers who moved markets but politicians. First, a hint by Vladimir Putin that Russia is ready to stabilise energy markets turned Wednesday's 31% gas price surge into a 35% reversal from the day's peaks - within two hours of the Russian president's remarks . Gas prices are still up six-fold this year and that's a big deal, especially for the euro zone; if gas stays at current levels, it would wipe out Europe's trade surplus, Deutsche Bank points out. Still, the gas price turnaround and an associated pullback in crude futures  calmed markets, easing immediate concerns over inflation spiralling out of control. Later in the day, another politician stepped in to soothe mounting concerns over a possible U.S. debt default - U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said his party would support an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December That helped Wall Street close firmer and took ten-year Treasury yields  off 3-1/2-month highs, though they remain above 1.5%. Finally, it emerged that U.S. President Joe Biden would virtually meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this year All that means that after tech-led gains in Asia, European  and U.S.  stock futures are both heading north. And on the crypto front, the recent rally has eased but Bitcoin  is still up 25% this month, helped by news George Soros' family office is trading the world's No.1 cryptocurrency. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: * Shares of Chinese Estates * British house prices rose by the most in almost 15 years in September * German real estate company Vonovia has reached 60.3% of voting rights to acquire Deutsche Wohnen * ECB speakers: Board Member Isabel Schnabel, Philip * U.S. weekly jobless claims * Fed speakers: Cleveland Fed's Loretta Mester Our Standards: Debt-saddled Chinese property firms took heavy fire in bond markets on Tuesday, after the poster child of the sector's woes, Evergrande Group , missed its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and others warned of defaults."

business,"Analysis: Fall in China's $1.3 trln land sales to test local finances, economy"," BEIJING, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Sagging demand at China's urban land auctions amid a crackdown on borrowing by private developers risks squeezing regional finances, pressuring local governments to scramble for other income sources to fund investments and support the economy. Land sales soared to a record 8.4 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) in 2020, the equivalent of Australia's annual gross domestic product, bolstering fiscal budgets in a pandemic year. But tighter regulations on borrowing by private developers since the summer of last year are increasingly eroding demand for land. The value of nationwide land sales abruptly fell 17.5% on year in August, according to Reuters calculations of finance ministry data, the biggest slide since February 2020. Further falls could force regional governments, who on average depend on land sales for a fifth of their revenue, to cut spending and investment. Many economists have already downgraded China's 2021 GDP growth forecast, due to a cooling property market and contagion risks from indebted property behemoth China Evergrande To boost incomes, some local governments may be driven to issue more bonds, increasing their debt obligations. They may even hasten plans for a controversial property tax, analysts say. ""In general, the proportion of land sales revenue for local governments in China is quite large, at over 20%, so if land sales decline, or their growth slows, local government spending will see a certain amount of pressure,"" said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong. FALLING DEMAND To better control land prices in the country's most valuable locations, and by extension, prices of finished homes, authorities said in February that China's 22 biggest cities can only conduct three rounds of land auctions this year. The authorities have also since put a cap on the highest bids to contain prices, as part of a vast crackdown across sectors as President Xi Jinping seeks to correct excesses and imbalances in China's economy and society. But since the first round of auctions in March-June, demand has fallen as cash-strapped developers stayed away. In an ongoing round of auctions in June-October, about 40% of the plots on offer were withdrawn or had no bidders as of Sept. 30, a Reuters analysis of over 1,000 public notices showed. That compared with 5% of untaken offers in the first round. Tianjin in northern China sold 40 out of 61 plots, while Shenyang, the provincial capital of Liaoning, offloaded 19 of 46 lots, the Reuters analysis showed. Moody's predicts land sales growth will be in the low single-digits in 2021 before declining in 2022. Sales grew 16% last year. To offset poorer sales, local governments could issue more bonds, but that would raise the prospect of a higher debt burden, Moody's warned in a report. Highly-indebted Tianjin and Liaoning may struggle to meet debt obligations if land sales worsen, according to Moody's. STATE SUPPORT State firms have dominated land auctions as private developers stuck to the sidelines, but it is uncertain whether this would be enough to safeguard local government revenues. The value of winning bids by state firms have been triple that of private developers in the June-October auctions so far, marking a departure from past trends. But, as of Sept. 30, their overall bids were down 45% to 277.2 billion yuan from the March-June auctions. In the southwestern megacity of Chengdu, state-controlled China Railway Construction Corp In contrast, private developers such as Fantasia Holdings When contacted by Reuters, Fantasia said it will control the pace of land acquisitions in line with its debt management, and that it currently has sufficient land reserves. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment. Seven out of China's 22 biggest cities have until the end of October to auction land, including Beijing and Shanghai. Longer term, local governments may seek other sources of fiscal revenue such as property taxes, ANZ's Wang said. China has mulled a nationwide property tax for over a decade but faced resistance from stakeholders including local governments themselves, who fear it would erode property values or trigger a market sell-off. ""Start with the pilots, and rules can be adjusted accordingly,"" she said.

business,Dollar takes a pause ahead of U.S. jobs data," NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies on Thursday, the day before U.S. labor market data that could provide clues to timing of the Federal Reserve's next move. Most major currency pairs clung to familiar ranges, with traders disinclined to place large wagers before the data's release. ""A rather typical pre-nonfarm payrolls lull has taken over the market today,"" said Michael Brown, senior analyst at payments firm Caxton in London. The U.S. Dollar Currency Index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was unchanged, trading at 94.199, not far from the one-year high of 94.504 touched last week. ""I think we?�ll probably range like this until the jobs report is out of the way, though even then any USD weakness should be faded given how a November taper looks near-certain,"" Brown said. The Federal Reserve has said it is likely to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and then follow up with interest rate increases, as the U.S. central bank's turn from pandemic crisis policies gains momentum. Friday's non-farm payrolls data is expected to show continued improvement in the labor market, with a forecast for 455,000 jobs added in September, a Reuters poll showed. ""A steadily improving U.S. labor market and solid U.S. economic growth should provide the Federal Reserve with the green light to start curbing its quantitative easing program,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note. In the week following the data the dollar tends to reverse most of the gain or loss that has occurred from the day of the NFP release, FX strategists said in a BofA Global Research report on Thursday. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but layoffs increased from a 24-year low in September in part as hospitals fired unvaccinated staff and lack of workers forced closures of facilities. Sterling rose 0.3% on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved a tad and analysts said the prospects of a Bank of England rate hike reduced some downside potential for the currency.

Elsewhere, South Korea's Kospi However, there were still reasons for caution around the region, especially with China on holiday, seemingly contributing to a delay in progress towards any resolution for beleaguered developer China Evergrande Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at UBP, said there were ongoing concerns about China's power crunch and its property market, given the government did not seem to in a hurry to step in even as debt problems at Evergrande threatened to spill over into the wider industry. ""There is contagion into the broader real estate sector, authorities are not doing more to intervene, and so investors are trying to assess what this new pain threshold means,"" he said. But he added that the improved mood in U.S.-China relations, especially the more constructive tone in the speech by trade chief Katherine Tai this week, had boosted risk sentiment. Also supporting equities, oil prices pulled away from multi-year highs hit a day earlier. An rally in oil prices had been a  major contributor to a sell-off in equities this week. U.S. crude  dipped 0.93% to $76.71 a barrel. Crude fell overnight after hitting a seven-year high of $79.78 on Wednesday on an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stocks. Brent crude  lost 0.5% to $80.69 per barrel, off its three-year high of $83.47 also hit on Wednesday. European and U.S. natural gas prices also both slipped over 10% overnight in volatile trade. European prices had hit all-time highs early on Wednesday amid an enduring supply crunch. The recent surge in global gas prices ??that have helped lift Asian LNG prices by 500% from a year ago ??have left the entire energy area prone to increased volatility, with power producers in Europe and Asia still expected to replenish tight stocks ahead of winter. The fall in energy prices and apparent temporary deal to avert a federal debt default contributed to a late rally on Wall Street. Global markets will next focus on payrolls data due on Friday, with investors anticipating that a reasonable figure will mean the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin tapering its massive stimulus programme at its November meeting.

But it said on Thursday the law did not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund in such unusual circumstances. Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said the CMA ""strongly believed"" the passengers should be offered a full refund. ""However, after considering the relevant law and gathering evidence in our investigation, we have concluded that the length of time that would be required to take this case through the courts, and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money,"" he said. He added the CMA hoped the law would be clarified. Ryanair said it welcomed the decision. ""We operated a limited schedule during UK lockdowns for customers who travelled for essential reasons,"" a spokesperson said. ""Passengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee, and many availed of this option.""

business,Britain's NatWest pleads guilty to money laundering failings," LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - NatWest The bank, which is 55% taxpayer owned after a 45 billion pound plus state bailout during the financial crisis, indicated in a London court guilty pleas to three criminal charges of not adequately monitoring customer accounts between 2012 and 2016. ""The facts of the case are complex, the likely sentence is a very large fine,"" Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which prosecuted the case against NatWest, told Westminster Magistrates' Court. NatWest could face a potential penalty of around 340 million pounds under sentencing guidelines, Montgomery told the court, although a judge will set the level of any fine later this year. Sara George, a white collar crime lawyer at Sidley, said the case sent a clear message to the banking industry to step up anti-money laundering systems and controls. NatWest, which is Britain's biggest business bank, said in a statement it will take a provision in its third quarter results next month in anticipation of a fine. The FCA alleged NatWest failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds in its accounts over five years, of which 264 million was in cash. But it said it would not take action against any current or former employees, while NatWest said it was not anticipating any other authority investigating this conduct. ""We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers,"" NatWest CEO Alison Rose said in a statement. NatWest said it had invested 700 million pounds over five years in money laundering prevention systems. 'COMPLY OR FACE COURT' A sentencing hearing will take place at a higher Crown Court, possibly around Dec. 7, the court was told. The criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, is the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law and represents a blow to Rose's drive to rehabilitate the bank's image, including rebranding it from the scandal-tainted Royal Bank of Scotland banner last year. Prosecuting a bank for criminal conduct is rare in Britain and, unlike in any civil action, can threaten a bank's ability to operate if it is convicted. However, the FCA confirmed it is not aiming to strip NatWest of any banking licences, limiting the potential fallout. ""Today's events should have compliance departments reviewing their own procedures to ensure adherence to the regulations,"" Neil Williams, deputy head of complex crime at Reeds Solicitor, said.

business,Emerging market 'cryptoization' threatens financial stability - IMF," LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The advent of digital currencies in emerging markets could spark ""cryptoization"" of local economies, potentially undermining exchange and capital controls and upsetting financial stability, the International Monetary Fund said on Friday. Bitcoin and its kin have in the last year soared in price and popularity, with emerging and developing market economies such as Vietnam, India and Pakistan seeing rapid growth in some measures of adoption, Cryptocurrencies offer, in theory, a cheaper and quicker way of sending money across borders. Backers say digital tokens such as stablecoins could also help protect savings from high inflation or fluctuations in local currencies. In September, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, with backers tipping the experiment to lower costs for billions of dollars of remittances sent to the Central American nation. The IMF said that unsound macroeconomic policies and inefficient payment systems are among the drivers of cryptocurrency adoption in emerging economies, along with the lure of quick gains that has also excited investors across the world. But the IMF said the exact level of adoption of crypto in emerging economies was hard to gauge accurately. Factors such as low credibility of central banks and weak domestic banking systems that can fuel ""dollarization"" can also contribute to growing crypto use, the Fund added. Dollarization is where a foreign currency - typically the U.S. currency - is used in addition to, or instead of, a domestic currency. High inflation or the instability of a domestic currency are among the drivers of the process. Wide adoption of stablecoins - digital tokens designed to hold a steady value and seen as useful for savings and commerce - could also pose significant challenges by reinforcing existing dollarization forces, the IMF said. ""Dollarization can impede central banks' effective implementation of monetary policy and lead to financial stability risks through currency mismatches on the balance sheets of banks, firms, and households,"" it said. ""Cryptoization"" could also become a threat to fiscal policy, with digital assets possibly facilitating tax evasion, the IMF added. The fund urged developing nations to strengthen macroeconomic policies and consider the possible benefits from issuing central bank digital currencies as a response to the rise of crypto.

business,French watchdog chief calls for ban on 'payment for order flow' in EU stock market," LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - ""Payment for order flow,"" a practice critics say has fuelled bouts of frenzied retail share trading on Wall Street, should be banned in the European Union, France's stock market regulator said on Thursday. In the United States, stockbrokers have touted for business among retail customers by offering zero commission services, with payment coming from sending the orders to a specific wholesale market maker for executing. Robert Ophele, chairman of France's AMF securities watchdog,  said the situation was even more complicated in the EU due to the lack of a single markets regulator. ""I am strongly inclined to favour the clarity of a ban for payment for order flow,"" Ophele told an event held by European markets industry body AFME. The EU is reviewing its securities market rules known as MiFID II with a view to making a series of tweaks in a bid to deepen its capital market now that Britain has left the bloc. France, president of the EU in the first half of 2022, will be responsible for marshalling reforms through the bloc. The EU's executive European Commission has said it wants to create a ""consolidated tape"" or record of transaction prices for shares traded across the bloc to make it easier for investors to spot the best deals. But there is debate over whether transaction prices should be published near to real-time or, Ophele said the closer to real-time the better for investors. ""If you just say let's have a delay, I am not sure it will make life simpler for the users of this consolidated tape,"" Ophele said. Pan-European funds industry body EFAMA said a real-time tape was essential to enhancing retail investor confidence in EU capital markets, and for asset managers to improve their trading strategies. Ophele said he hoped that EU changes to improve the quality of stock market data could come in by January 2023. Banks argue that once data quality has improved calls from bourses to curb off-exchange trading - or over-the-counter dealing often done via banks - will be seen as unjustified.

business,Subsiding COVID-19 infections boost U.S. private payrolls in September," WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in September as COVID-19 infections started subsiding, boosting hiring at restaurants and other high-contact businesses. The ADP National Employment Report released on Wednesday supported expectations that job growth picked up last month, though it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report. September's employment report due on Friday will garner more attention after the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November. Fed Chair Jerome Powell believes the economy is one ""decent"" monthly employment report short of meeting the U.S. central bank's threshold for tapering its bond buying program. ""It looks like the gain in employment will qualify as 'decent',"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the first estimate from the ADP is not a particularly good predictor of official payrolls."" Private payrolls increased by 568,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Data for August was revised lower to show 340,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 374,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 428,000 jobs. Employment gains averaged 410,000 jobs in the third quarter,  a slowdown compared to the second-quarter average of 748,000. Last month, the leisure and hospitality industry added 226,000 jobs after creating 155,000 positions in August. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 49,000 jobs, while hiring at construction sites also rose by 49,000. Job gains in other sectors were modest. Large firms accounted for the bulk of job creation, followed by medium-sized companies. Small business hiring climbed by 63,000 jobs after rising 61,000 in August. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics. It has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences. Stocks on Wall Street fell as the ADP report fanned fears that the Fed could tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher. MORTGAGE RATES RISING Expectations that the Fed will soon start to withdrew some of the monetary support to the economy have boosted mortgage rates, hurting refinancing activity and demand for home purchase loans. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed mortgage applications dropped 6.9% last week from the prior week. Refinance applications tumbled 9.6% from the previous week and were down 16% from a year ago. Applications for loans to buy a home dropped 1.7% from a week ago. The 30-year mortgage fixed rate rose four basis points to 3.14% last week, the highest since July. The pick-up in private payrolls suggests the economic expansion remains on track even as gross domestic product growth appears to have slowed sharply in the third quarter because of the resurgence in COVID-19 infections in summer and relentless shortages that have undercut motor vehicle sales. The Atlanta Fed is predicting that GDP growth braked to a  1.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. ""Stronger job growth in September could indicate that the drag on hiring from the recent increase in coronavirus cases is fading,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 473,000 jobs in September. The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5.1% from 5.2% in August. But labor market indicators were mixed in September. A survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. The number of people on state unemployment rolls fell in mid-September relative to mid-August. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in August. But the ISM's gauge of services industry employment slipped, with businesses reporting that ""labor shortages (were) experienced at all levels."" The economy is experiencing an acute shortage of labor as the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the virus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July. Economists are cautiously optimistic that the labor crunch will start easing in the fall and through winter after the expiration in September of federal government-funded unemployment benefits, which businesses and Republicans blamed for the worker shortage. Our Standards: The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives is expected on Tuesday to give final approval to a Senate-passed bill temporarily raising the government's borrowing limit to $28.9 trillion, putting off the risk of default until early December."
business,Dollar strength holds back Asian FX; rupee bears re-emerge," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Investors raised short bets on most Asian emerging currencies, a fortnightly Reuters poll found, as a slew of factors including U.S. rate-hike expectations, rising inflation and signs of slowing global economic growth boosted the dollar. Long positions on the Singapore dollar , Taiwan's dollar  and the Indian rupee  were reversed, while bearish views on the South Korean won  hit a two-year peak, the poll of 12 respondents showed. The Indonesian rupiah  was the only currency with a bullish trend, although long bets were almost halved. The safe-haven greenback has risen to a one-year high since the Federal Reserve's hawkish tilt two weeks ago led markets to price in a rate hike sometime in 2022, with sharp gains in benchmark Treasury yields adding to its appeal. The dollar is expected to dominate the currency markets for another year as inflation concerns come to the fore, with surging energy prices amid a supply crunch threatening global economic growth. Asia's economic prospects have already been marred by China's slowdown, supply chain bottlenecks and lingering effects of devastating COVID-19 waves in trade-reliant countries like Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. However, bets on the yuan  barely changed as the currency remained resilient despite a debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Crude prices testing $80 per barrel prompted investors to turn bearish on the rupee for the first time since mid-August, as India is the world's third-biggest oil consumer. The rupee has been the most heavily sold currency in Asia since the Fed meeting. Analysts at Barclays said a recent slowdown in foreign fund flows into Indian equities seemed to be compensated by a pick-up in bonds as the economy's growth trajectory was intact and would keep the rupee from breaching the 75.0 per dollar mark. Taiwan and South Korea's currencies have depreciated in tandem with a sell-off in local bourses dominated by tech stocks, which are sensitive to inflation. They have faced outflows of $2.13 billion and $762 million, respectively, so far this month. Meanwhile, investors preferred the rupiah more among Asian currencies as higher commodity prices and a large trade surplus were seen putting a floor under the risky currency, Barclays analysts said. The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht. The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). The survey findings  are provided below (positions in U.S. dollar versus each currency): Our Standards: Debt-saddled Chinese property firms took heavy fire in bond markets on Tuesday, after the poster child of the sector's woes, Evergrande Group , missed its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and others warned of defaults."
business,"Sweden, Norway currencies eye multi-year highs vs euro"," OSLO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Swedish and Norwegian currencies will gain ground versus the euro in the coming 12 months, likely hitting multi-year highs at a time of strong economic recovery in the Nordic region, a Reuters poll of analysts predicted. Sweden and Norway recently ended almost all remaining social restrictions amid a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and a corresponding drop in infections, allowing businesses to thrive. After plunging when the coronavirus hit last year, the currencies have recovered to trade slightly stronger against the euro than their pre-pandemic levels. They will continue to rise, but the likely scope of gains is more limited, the poll showed. Norway's crown has rallied about 6% since late August to trade at around 9.94 against the euro and could move to 9.83 in the coming year, the poll showed, which would be its strongest level since January 2020. Analysts attribute the crown's lift in recent weeks to hawkish monetary policy and a surge in the price of Norway's Norges Bank last month But the often-volatile Norwegian currency is also at risk of periods of decline and is forecast to be weaker than its current level at the end of 2021 before rising again next year. ""NOK is no safe haven in troubling times and could easily weaken if sentiment in markets sours,"" Nordea Markets cautioned. In Sweden, where the currency has weakened slightly against the euro this year, the crown is expected to make gains over the coming 12 months to hit its strongest level since early 2018, the poll showed. The Riksbank has held its benchmark repo rate at 0% and expects to keep it there for several more years despite strong economic recovery and above-target inflation. Nonetheless some economists see the rebound in the Swedish economy as an opportunity for the central bank to tweak its overall monetary policy approach in 2022. ""The stars are starting to align behind our view that policymakers will start to allow the balance sheet to contract next year,"" Capital Economics said in a recent note to clients. The Reuters poll predicted the Swedish currency would make gains of around 2.5% against the euro to trade at around 9.92 one year from now, the median forecast showed.

technology,Apple likely to cut iPhone 13 production due to chip crunch -Bloomberg News," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc The company was expected to produce 90 million units of the new iPhone models by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg. Shares of Apple fell 1.2% in after-hours trading, while  Texas Instruments and Broadcom were both down about 1%. Apple declined to comment. Broadcom and Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. In July, Apple forecast slowing revenue growth and said the chip shortage, which had started hitting its ability to sell Macs and iPads, would also crimp iPhone production. Texas Instruments also gave a soft revenue outlook that month, hinting on chip supply concerns for the rest of the year. The chip crunch has put immense pressure on industries from automobiles to electronics, leading many automakers to temporarily suspend production. With its massive purchasing power and long-term supply agreements with chip vendors, Apple has weathered the supply crunch better than many other companies, leading some analysts to forecast that iPhone 13 models released in September would have a strong sales year as consumers looked to upgrade devices for 5G networks. Jeff Fieldhack, research director for Counterpoint Research, said the reported Apple production cut could also be part of the iPhone maker's normal launch process of over-ordering devices to be prepared for an initial customer rush and then trimming orders as sales trends become clearer. Fieldhack said iPhone 13 sales appear to be healthy and higher than last year's iPhone 12, and Counterpoint is not changing its estimate of 85 million to 90 million iPhone 13 sales for the fourth quarter.

technology,"Twitter debuts new ad features, revamped algorithm ahead of ecommerce push"," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc The new features come as Twitter is pushing to grow its performance advertising business, a strategy that aims to quickly generate sales, and constituted just 15% of Twitter's business last year. The effort could help Twitter reach its goal of doubling annual revenue by 2023. The San Francisco-based company is positioning itself to eventually allow brands to sell products through the service by first improving on its ability to show users relevant ads and increasing the likelihood they will click the ad. ""Performance ads are a very large opportunity ... that's relatively untapped for us,"" said Kamara Benjamin, group product manager at Twitter, in an interview. ""Ultimately, this is going to lead to people installing apps, visiting websites and finding products that meet their needs."" Ads promoting downloads for mobile games and other apps, which are a major type of ad on social media sites, will now allow users to initiate the download without leaving the Twitter app, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. Previously, users had to leave Twitter to download other apps. Twitter added it is working on new tools to let companies run ads to find customers who are more likely to make in-app purchases. Slide-show ads that feature multiple products can now send users to different websites when they click the ad, whereas previously brands could only choose one destination. This increased the number of clicks by 25% on ad campaigns that set a goal of driving website visits, the company said. Twitter also improved the advertising algorithm, showing the ads to a larger pool of people at the beginning of the campaign so it can better gauge user interest, Benjamin said. Those algorithm improvements led to a 36% increase in ad campaigns that achieved at least five downloads during the time period that the ad ran on Twitter, the company said.

technology,Cryptocurrencies post eight straight weeks of inflows - CoinShares data," NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency products and funds attracted $226.2 million in investments last week, marking their eighth straight week of inflows, a report from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Tuesday. Over an eight-week run, total crypto product inflows hit $638 million, with a year-to-date total of $6.3 billion. Bitcoin, as expected, led the way, nabbing $225 million, for a fourth straight week of inflows, according to data in the week ended Oct. 8. ""We believe the turnaround in sentiment towards bitcoin is due to constructive statements from SEC chair Gary Gensler, potentially allowing a bitcoin ETF (exchange traded fund) in the U.S.,"" wrote James Butterfill, investment strategist at CoinShares, in the report. At a Financial Times conference a few weeks ago, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gensler repeated his support for bitcoin ETFs that would invest in futures contracts instead of the digital currency itself. Bitcoin soared to a five-month high of just under $58,000  on Monday, boosted by persistent institutional demand as it gains legitimacy among investors. On Tuesday, the world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value was last down 3.6% at $55,402. Since a low of $28,600 hit in June, bitcoin has gained about 88% of its value. Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in its latest research note, said bitcoin experienced a boost in network activity in the first week of October, suggesting new demand is beginning to enter in the fourth quarter. In addition, Glassnode said the positive sentiment and constructive price action has also started to creep back into the derivatives markets amid climbing open interest and rising swap funding rates. Ethereum, meanwhile, saw minor outflows totaling $14 million, data showed, as it continues to lose market share to bitcoin. Its market share has fallen 1% to 24% of assets under management in the last week alone. Other altcoins such as solana and cardano posted inflows of $12.5 million and $3 million, respectively, data showed. While other digital tokens, namely polkadot, ripple and litecoin posted outflows.

technology,Samsung leader Lee admits in court to unlawful sedative use," SEOUL, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Samsung conglomerate chief Jay Y. Lee admitted in court on Tuesday to unlawful use of a controlled substance, as the executive's legal troubles continued despite his release on parole in August after a bribery conviction. Lee appeared at the Seoul Central District Court where, in a short first hearing, he said he received propofol - a sedative used in anaesthesia - 41 times from 2015 through 2020. His release in August had raised expectations of major decisions being taken at Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Prosecutors, who are seeking a fine of 70 million won ($58,327) and an additional fee of 17 million won, said that Lee had been administered propofol under the guise of a skin treatment or unrelated to a legitimate treatment. ""This matter originated as for treatment, but I am deeply regretful,"" Lee said. ""I will ... make sure that this does not happen again,"" Lee told the small court, where about 15 people were present, adding he had not used the drug since his release. Lee's lawyer told the court that Lee had received treatment for medical purposes, originally due to psychological pressure after the hospitalisation of his father and then as a result of the graft scandal and trial leading to his January conviction. The court ruling is scheduled for Oct 26. Under South Korean law, the recipient of a controlled substance deemed to have been administered illegally is liable for prosecution, as well as those who administered the drug. Staff at a clinic where Lee received the sedative, who are being tried separately, have denied wrongdoing. Prosecutors were first made aware of the matter in 2020 but were advised to drop their investigation in March 2021 by an independent panel reviewing prosecution probes. They continued to seek a fine as recently as June before another police report of sedative use led the court to order a hearing. As propofol is less likely to be misused than many other controlled substances, many similar cases of unlawful use have resulted in fines rather than jail terms. Lee was convicted in January of bribery and embezzlement and sentenced to 30 months in jail - including a year served before his sentencing.

technology,Music streamers turn to telcos to make Africa pay," JOHANNESBURG/STOCKHOLM, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Africa, with its internationally recognised musical talent - and growing mobile phone use - is central to Swedish music streamer Spotify's As African artists such as Nigeria's Burna Boy and South Africa's Black Coffee are streamed across the world, the continent was seen as an obvious choice and is the home to more than a third of the company's 85 new markets. The problem is payment on a continent where many people are more likely to have a mobile phone than a bank account. That means Spotify's first task as it implements a plan announced in February to almost double its footprint is to win over the telecom companies that often equate to banks. Phiona Okumu, Spotify's head of music for Sub-Saharan Africa, told Reuters the company secured ""alternative payment methods"", namely M-Pesa, when it moved into Kenya in February. Owned by Kenya's biggest telecoms operator, Safaricom ""A lot of African countries are unbanked so that means they don't use credit cards and this is very true for a lot of east African (countries) and in Kenya you use M-Pesa for the most part,"" Okumu said. Elsewhere in Africa, Spotify is seeking other collaborators. ""We are having conversations with the right partners to ensure that we are providing solutions to payment problems that several African consumers face in different parts of the continent,"" Okumu said.

technology,Billionaire Alibaba founder Jack Ma reappears in Hong Kong - sources," HONG KONG, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group The Chinese billionaire has been keeping a low profile since delivering a speech in October last year in Shanghai criticising China's financial regulators. That triggered a chain of events that resulted in the shelving of his Ant Group's mega IPO. While Ma made a limited number of public appearances in mainland China after that, as speculation swirled about his whereabouts, one of the sources said the visit marked his first trip to the Asian financial hub since last October. Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of its regular business hours. Comments from Ma typically come via the company. The sources declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints. Ma, once China's most famous and outspoken entrepreneur, met at least ""a few"" business associates over meals last week, said the people. Ma, who is mostly based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, where his business empire is headquartered, owns at least one luxury house in the former British colony that also houses some of his companies' offshore business operations. Alibaba is also listed in Hong Kong, besides New York. The former English teacher disappeared from public view for three months before surfacing in January, speaking to a group of teachers by video. That eased concern about his unusual absence from the limelight and sent Alibaba shares surging. In May, Ma made a rare visit to Alibaba's Hangzhou campus during the firm's annual ""Ali Day"" staff and family event, company sources have said. On Sept. 1, photographs of Ma visiting several agricultural greenhouses in the eastern Zhejiang province, home to both Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant, went viral on Chinese social media. The next day, Alibaba said it would invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) by 2025 in support of ""common prosperity"", becoming the latest corporate giant to pledge support for the wealth sharing initiative driven by President Xi Jinping. Alibaba and its tech rivals have been the target of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on issues ranging from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights. The e-commerce behemoth was fined a record $2.75 billion in April over monopoly violations. Earlier this year, regulators also imposed a sweeping restructuring on Ant, whose botched $37 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market would have been the world's largest.

In a letter seen by Reuters, 107 Democrats urged Pelosi to retain the credit supported by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, the AFL-CIO and U.S. automakers. The $4,500 credit would provide a significant boost to Detroit's three automakers -- General Motors Co ""We strongly support leveling the playing field between non-union and unionized workforces by including the added $4,500 incentive to support union-made EVs,"" the letter said led by Representative Thomas Suozzi. Suozzi said the incentives ""help guarantee that working men and women are an integral part of that success story."" Pelosi's office declined to comment. Tesla Inc Last month, 12 major foreign automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp A House panel last month approved legislation to boost EV credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. The foreign automakers said the proposal ""would unfairly disadvantage American workers who have chosen not to join a union and produce more than half of all vehicles in the United States and the vast majority of American-made EVs."" The tax credits, which are part of proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years. The EV proposal also does away with phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible again, along with Tesla, although Tesla would not receive the $4,500 credit.

technology,U.S. agency submits initial recommendations on app data security to White House," WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it submitted an initial set of recommendations on data security under an executive order signed by President Joe Biden. In June, Biden withdrew a series of Trump-era executive orders that sought to ban new downloads of WeChat and TikTok, and ordered a Commerce Department review of security concerns posed by those apps. The order directed Commerce to make recommendations by last Thursday to protect U.S. data acquired or accessible by companies controlled by foreign adversaries. ""The department submitted an initial set of recommendations to the administration?�s key national security advisers,"" a  Commerce spokesperson said. The administration of former President Donald Trump had attempted to block new users from downloading the apps and ban other technical transactions that Chinese-owned short video-sharing app TikTok and WeChat both said would effectively block the apps' use in the United States. U.S. courts blocked those orders, which never took effect. The Trump administration contended that WeChat and TikTok posed national security concerns because sensitive personal data of U.S. users could be collected by China?�s government. Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked the Commerce Department for an update ""on recommendations the U.S. Department of Commerce is obligated to produce on how to protect Americans??data in the wake of President Biden?�s decision to rescind the ban on these harmful apps and their continued operation in the United States."" Last month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters the administration is ""very serious about protecting Americans' data"" and was working with allies. ""That's really hard work,"" Raimondo said. ""Doing some executive order that's meaningless on TikTok is not the way to do it."" TikTok has over 100 million users in the United States. Rubio asked what steps Commerce is ""taking to ensure such personal information does not end up in Beijing?�s possession."" A separate review of TikTok launched in late 2019 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States remains active, a White House official said in June, declining to offer any details. Biden's executive order revoked the WeChat and TikTok orders Trump issued in August 2020, along with another in January that targeted eight other communications and financial technology software applications.

technology,Crypto trading thrives in Nigeria despite official disapproval," LAGOS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nigerian art dealer Ebuka Joseph started using cryptocurrencies last year when business ground to a halt due to COVID-19. Now he is hooked even though the financial authorities disapprove. ""Crypto just allows me to transact freely and within minutes we are done with our transactions,"" the 28-year-old told Reuters from a friend's studio in Lagos where he displays his works. Nigeria's Central Bank barred local banks from working with cryptocurrencies in February, warning of ""severe regulatory sanctions"" and freezing accounts of firms it says are using them. But Joseph's appetite for crypto, like many in Nigeria, has only increased. For people like him, the clampdown has highlighted the benefits of using currencies outside the central bank's control, and Nigeria remains the largest market for cryptocurrency trading platforms like Paxful. Nigerians are turning to crypto for business, to protect their savings as the naira loses value, and to send payments abroad because it is often hard to obtain U.S. dollars, experts and users told Reuters. In March, just after the central bank ban, the dollar volume of cryptocurrencies sent from Nigeria rose to $132 million, up 17% from the previous month, research firm Chainalysis said. Transactions in June were 25% above the same month last year. Sly Megida, another artist using crypto to sell his works, said his buyers worldwide readily accept the use of digital currencies and they have also protected his finances. ""The naira is digressing and we are trying to keep the value of the art,"" he said, calling crypto ""the currency where people don't think that I am paying too much or too less"". DANGERS REMAIN The Paxful peer-to-peer platform that Joseph uses experienced a 57% rise in trading volume in Nigeria in the year to June, while user numbers surged 83%. Exchange Yellowcard, which has adopted the peer-to-peer model in Nigeria since February, told Reuters that use ""has continued to absolutely skyrocket"". Both Paxful, which has opened an office in Abuja to lobby the government to change its attitude to crypto, and Yellowcard said Nigerians generally turn to crypto for business rather than speculation. Chainalysis, in a report last month on African crypto, said the central bank ban locked most Nigerians out of traditional crypto exchanges, so many shifted to a peer-to-peer system. This goes via platforms such as Paxful or Local Bitcoins, which vet both parties. But other users just exchange crypto for Nigerian naira or other currencies with people they find on WhatsApp or Telegram. As a result, Chainalysis said Nigeria's crypto use is likely even higher than its figures suggest. Risks remain, however. In August, the central bank froze the accounts of some crypto users for allegedly sourcing funds from illegal foreign exchange dealers, leaving many companies that use cryptocurrencies reluctant to talk about it. Joseph, though, is undeterred. ""You can sell to people outside the country, and they can actually pay in different currencies, which you can always convert,"" Joseph said.

Median prices for Austin houses have risen some 40% over the last two years, with the median price for a house around $549,000 in September, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. Frequent reports of out-of-state buyers, particularly Californians, purchasing houses in cash at double the asking price have frustrated  many Austinites. Over the summer, nearly three in every four houses sold in the city went for above the  asking price, Redfin data showed. Even before Musk's relocation announcement, the electric vehicle maker planned to bring some 10,000 workers to an imposing new factory east of the city center. It is unclear how many corporate workers Tesla will relocate from California, or hire in Texas. ""All these Californians coming here is also changing the culture, and I'm worried it will become too much,"" said Reed Chorry, 26, who moved to Austin from Houston several years ago and works in sales. The city's unofficial motto - ""Keep Austin Weird"" - has given rise to a quirky, bohemian cultural scene that has turned local music festivals like Austin City Limits and South by Southwest into national attractions. ""It will be hard to keep that up when Austin becomes bigger and bigger,"" said Ryan Baker, 32, who works at a restaurant in East Austin. Austin Mayor Steve Adler welcomed Tesla's decision and said the company fits right in with Austin's strong innovative, entrepreneurial and environmentally focused culture. His office did not respond to questions about housing affordability. Austin's rapid growth is also expected to exacerbate the city's congestion problems, with three out of four residents driving to work alone in their car. While Austin is working to improve its public transit network, Tesla's factory is located in a transit desert. The city may evaluate transit options to the plant, but it expects most of Tesla's workers to drive to the plant, Austin Transportation Director Rob Spillar said. Austin hopes an increase in housing, stores and medical clinics will attract workers to live close to the plant, Spillar said. Roberts Communities, a developer for affordable manufactured housing, is hoping to benefit. The company has bought large plots of land just minutes from the Tesla factory and sells houses at around $80,000. Tesla factory workers will receive an average annual salary of $47,000, an income considered low by Travis County's health and human services division.

technology,Analysis: Tesla speeds the EV industry's South by Southwest drive," AUSTIN, Texas, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's Electric vehicle startups and established automakers have lined up $24 billion in investments in new factories in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kentucky. CEO Elon Musk's The competition among states for electric vehicle jobs is intense, and has a political dimension. Democratic-leaning Blue States such as California are home to many electric vehicle buyers and EV company investors, who have strong views on climate policy. Many of the states getting EV jobs are politically conservative Red states, whose Republican governors are both supportive of the fossil fuel industry and eager to welcome electric vehicle manufacturers and their jobs with subsidies and regulatory streamlining. ""The Lone Star State is the land of opportunity and innovation. Welcome,"" Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted on Thursday after Tesla announced its move. Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, now faces the challenge of taking advantage of the Texas business climate without alienating workers recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area's vibrant technology industry. It also has to consider the big base of Tesla vehicle customers in more politically liberal states such as California and New York. ""Tesla does not want to invite criticisms or attacks from public advocacy groups accusing them of looking for a large incentive package or abandoning California at a time when the state is in peril,"" said John Boyd, principal of Boyd Company, a site selection firm. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday praised Musk for having invested in California, including its SpaceX facility, and creating jobs. But Newsom said the state also offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax subsidies to Tesla. ""Our regulatory environment helped create a company and grow that company."" UNIONIZING Detroit automakers such as Ford Motor Co That complex and related new operations in Kentucky could create 11,000 jobs. The United Auto Workers union quickly called on Ford to assure those would be union jobs. But in Tennessee and Kentucky, union membership is optional, and workers at other auto manufacturers in those states have so far rejected UAW organizing efforts. Musk had a public falling-out with California when regulators forced Tesla to suspend production during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. At one point, Musk threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future programs out of the state. Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, said he moved to Texas last year, and he has taken to his new home, wearing Western-style bandannas and shirts. California has income tax rates up to 13.3%, while Texas has no tax on personal income. California, however, also accounted for about 15% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2020. On Thursday, Musk said the headquarters move is not a matter of Tesla leaving California entirely, and said production from Tesla's Fremont assembly plant and Reno, Nevada, battery factory will rise by 50%. Employees at Tesla's Palo Alto area offices expect engineers to stay in Silicon Valley, though some finance staffers could move, one source said. One awkward issue for Texas officials and Tesla to sort out is that Texas law currently forbids Tesla from selling vehicles directly to customers in the state. Austin is the fastest-growing U.S. metropolitan region, its population growing 30% between 2010 and 2020 to some 2.3 million. Like other large Texas cities, Austin and its surrounding Travis County, where the Tesla factory is located, are governed by Democrats, setting it apart from the majority of Texas' conservative, less densely populated counties. The Austin metro area is a technology hub, home to PC maker Dell Technologies Inc South Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics Austin's Democratic mayor, Steve Adler, welcomed the decision, saying Tesla will create ""the clean manufacturing, middle-skill jobs Austin needs."" Known for its quirky culture, Austin is also home to large music festivals such as Austin City Limits and South by Southwest, drawing large crowds each year. But the drastic growth and the influx of many well-paid Californians has faced resistance by some local residents, with reports of out-of-state buyers purchasing houses for cash at double the asking price, frustrating many Austinites. Our Standards: Tesla Inc has agreed to lease office space from HP Inc near the electric carmaker's current headquarters in Palo Alto, California, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters."
technology,From cars to 'ARMY bombs': Chip crunch creeps into K-pop world," Oct 8 (Reuters) - As top K-pop bands get ready to go back on stage or live stream new shows after being sidelined by the pandemic, their fans discover the global chip crisis has also caught up with the world of catchy tunes, glitzy outfits and elaborate dance routines. Light sticks, a must-have accessory for hard-core enthusiasts of South Korean pop, have become pricier and harder to get due to the shortage that has hit production of anything from smartphones to cars. The glowing wands fans wave during concerts and virtual events are fitted with so-called microcontrollers for power management and to pair with a phone to change colors, and highlight how far the squeeze has rippled through various industries and aspects of everyday life. The price of light sticks, used by ""ARMY"" or fans of mega-band BTS and referred to as ""ARMY bombs"", has increased by $2 to $59 from Oct. 1, Hybe ""I sure hope prices won't get too high since a lot of ARMY and other fans too cannot afford such prices,"" said Pervushina Elizaveta, an entertainment company employee and a BTS fan from Estepona, Spain. Fans of South Korean boy band SEVENTEEN will have to cough up $3 more for their light sticks, while supporters of acts such as EXO, SHINee, Girls' Generation and YG Entertainment's BlackPink are entirely out of luck. SM Entertainment's Hybe, SM Entertainment and other top Korean entertainment companies did not respond to requests for comment. While the Grammy-nominated BTS plans to perform live in Los Angeles in November and December for the first time since the pandemic, other South Korean acts are scheduling online shows. Still, fans are looking forward to make the most of those, with light sticks on and sharing messages in chatrooms. ""It's a fun way to feel connected to other fans all around the world so when you do get to enjoy a concert even from home you can somehow feel part of something amazing!"" said Starla Stafford, a fan from Chattanooga, Tennessee. LONG WAIT Compounding the pain, semiconductors in light sticks are manufactured using older technologies and such low-end chips face the biggest shortage right now, said Jim Handy, an analyst with semiconductor market research firm Objective Analysis. Wait times for semiconductor deliveries have now stretched to up to six months, compared with the usual about two months, manufacturers said. ""I bulk ordered microcontroller chips in advance, hoping live events will be back next year, because the delivery time is long,"" said Ashton Jungmin Choi, a co-founder of FANLIGHT, a Seoul-based company that makes light sticks for bands such as BTS, EXO and SuperM. He said shipping charges have gone up three times, and chips cost 30% more compared with a year ago. ""It is very difficult to get any light stick. They are always in demand and it has been impossible to get the BTS Army Bombs,"" said Mette Kidal, owner of All In Kpop, a Denmark-based K-pop merchandise retailer that opened a new store in the country this month to cater to surging demand.

technology,"New rules needed to cover risks from cloud computing, says Bank of England"," LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - New rules will be needed to deal with operational risks from banks relying on outsourced 'cloud' computing from Amazon ""Regulated firms will continue to have primary responsibility for managing risks stemming from their outsourcing and third-party dependencies,"" the BoE's Financial Policy Committee said in a statement. ""However, additional policy measures, some requiring legislative change, are likely to be needed to mitigate the financial stability risks stemming from concentration in the  provision of some third-party services."" Measures should include an ability to designate some third parties as 'critical', meaning they would be required to meet 'resilience' standards which would be regularly tested. The BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority are due to publish a discussion paper on the subject next year, it said. The measures are similar to those in a European Union law now making its way through the approval process. ""These tests and sector exercises of critical third parties could potentially be carried out in collaboration with overseas financial regulators and other relevant UK authorities,"" the BoE said. The This has already led to banks thinking harder about the business case for the cloud in some services, and whether it would get the green light from regulators. ""Trying to replicate this service on premises or a different cloud actually doubles your cost,"" said Mark Corns, a director for technology consulting at KPMG. Banks who moved early into the cloud are having to ""retrofit"" resilience requirements, Corns said. ""What we are seeing is a much more tentative approach to what goes into the cloud.

technology,The kids are alright: finance's old guard sees generational change," Oct 8 (Reuters) - When Wall Street veterans gathered this week for one of their first in-person conferences since the pandemic began, the focus, on emerging issues from ""meme stocks,"" to cryptocurrencies and free trading apps, signaled a new era for the world of finance. More than 460 finance executives, regulators and politicians met in Washington, with another 800 tuning in virtually, for the Security Traders Association (STA) annual conference, an event better known for rehashing dry decades-old issues from trading fees and market data to advances in algorithmic trading. But this year's gathering, which wrapped up on Friday, follows an extraordinary few months in which millions of young retail traders convening in online forums and trading through low-cost mobile apps have frequently piled into ""meme stocks"" - most notably video retailer GameStop The volatility of that episode was a common theme and for many participants the issues struck close to home: speaking in fireside chats and panels, several said their kids had been drawn into the market after retail brokers like Charles Schwab Corp Robinhood said at the end of last quarter it had 21.3 million active users, with an average age of 31, and that half of those were first-time investors. The company is also trying to recruit new users on college campuses, offering $15 to start investing and the chance to win $20,000 towards tuition. ""I'm thrilled that my kids are even talking about trying to invest and save and look towards the future,"" Republican lawmaker Bill Huizenga, who has five kids, aged 15 to 24. ""I would think we should be encouraging that,"" he added. Eric Pollackov, global head of ETF capital markets at Invesco, marveled that his son, a college sophomore, used a mobile app to buy an exchange-traded fund created by his firm that tracks U.S. long-term, investment-grade corporate bonds. ""What I love to watch in this industry ... is the adoption rate by all types of investors,"" he said. But while many participants cheered the emergence of a young new investing class, others sounded a note of caution. After what happened in the GameStop case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a consultation on game-like behavioral prompts some brokers use to drive transactions, amid worries young investors are being manipulated into risky trades. Allison Lee, a Democratic SEC commissioner, said her five children, all in their 20s and 30s, also use trading apps. Talking to them about market risks tends to ""bore them to death,"" she said, but she wants to ensure brokers give full disclosure around potential conflicts of interest and how they make their revenue, so everyone understands how they work. Cryptocurrencies are also drawing in young investors, including the children of ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo, known among crypto-evangelists as #CryptoDad for his support of the new industry. He recalled how a discussion during a family ski trip with twenty-somethings who had never shown interest in the markets before opened his eyes to ""a true generation gap."" ""They intuitively get digital money, they intuitively get tokenization, and they intuitively get bitcoin and crypto,"" he said. The head of the SEC has warned of widespread fraud in cryptocurrencies. STA head Jim Toes said protections were needed for this new generation of investors, noting that his 23-year-old was also engaging in the market for the first time. ""It also kind of renews this sense of responsibility that we all have of being guardians of the marketplace,"" he said, ""and making sure we leave something better for the next generation.""

technology,EXCLUSIVE Dutch watchdog finds Apple app store payment rules anti-competitive - sources," AMSTERDAM, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Dutch antitrust authority has found that Apple?�s rules requiring software developers to use its in-app payment system are anti-competitive and ordered it to make changes, four people familiar with the matter said, in the latest regulatory setback for the iPhone maker. Apple's app-store payment policies, in particular its requirement that app developers exclusively use its payment system where commissions range between 15% and 30%, have long drawn complaints from developers. The Dutch investigation into whether Apple's practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019 but later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps. They included a complaint from Match Group, owner of the popular dating service Tinder, which said Apple's rules were hindering it from direct communications with its customers about payments. The Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) last month informed the U.S. technology giant of its decision, making it the first antitrust regulator to make a finding the company has abused market power in the app store, though Apple is facing challenges in multiple countries. ACM has not levied a fine against Apple, but demanded changes to the in-app payment system, the people said. The decision has not been seen by Reuters. An ACM spokesperson declined to comment, saying that the matter is currently under legal review. The regulator has previously said it expects to publish its decision this year. Apple was not immediately available to comment. The company argues its app store rules ensure security and privacy for its users. Match declined to comment. A lawyer representing the company in the Dutch case said he could not comment. The people said Apple has asked the Rotterdam District Court for an injunction to block publication of the ruling during its appeal. A court spokesman confirmed the existence of the case to block publication, but could not say when a decision is expected. The proceedings are not open to the press or public. The European Commission launched an investigation in 2020 parallel to the Dutch probe, but focused on whether app store rules favour Apple apps when there are competing products, such as Apple Music versus Spotify. A U.S. judge last month ordered Apple to make it easier for apps to promote alternative payment systems. Plaintiff Epic Games, the maker of ""Fortnite"", is appealing, saying the decision does not go far enough. South Korea has enacted a law barring app store operators from forcing developers to use their official payment systems. Apple and Google are due to respond this month on how they will comply. In Japan, Apple settled an antitrust probe by agreeing to allow some music, video and e-book apps, notably Netflix, to promote purchase options outside their apps.

The Silenced No More Act had been co-sponsored by Ifeoma Ozoma, who quit Pinterest Inc Supporters say the law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will enable workers to speak out about experiences of harassment and discrimination without fear that companies could tear up severance packages. They say allowing more people to publicly address workplace treatment could help curb systemic racism and other problems ailing many companies. The new law says settlement agreements cannot prevent or restrict workers from disclosing facts related to harassment and discrimination claims they have filed against the company. It also bars settlements from including non-disparagement clauses that stop people from talking about unlawful acts in the workplace. As part of efforts to respond to #metoo stories, California lawmakers three years ago banned companies from imposing non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, in cases of sexual harassment, sexual assault or sex discrimination out of concern that secret deals were allowing companies to maintain problematic cultures. The new law covers confidentiality in a broader range of cases, including racial discrimination and harassment based on disability.

technology,"One month on, El Salvador's bitcoin use grows but headaches persist"," EL ZONTE, El Salvador, Oct 7 (Reuters) - A growing number of El Salvadorans have experimented with bitcoin since the country became the first to adopt it as legal tender last month, with a couple of million dollars sent daily by migrants using the cryptocurrency. But only a fraction of the Central American nation's businesses have taken a bitcoin payment and technical problems have plagued the government's cryptocurrency app, frustrating even committed users of the technology. Construction worker Adalberto Galvez, 32, said he had lost $220 when trying to withdraw cash from the Chivo digital wallet. Like Galvez, dozens of Salvadorans told Reuters they had at least one problem with Chivo, named after the local word for ""good"", and few had used it on a daily basis. ""It took my money but gave me nothing,"" said Galvez, who had already been using bitcoin successfully for months with another application at an experimental small-scale bitcoin economy project dubbed Bitcoin Beach in the coastal town of El Zonte. Galvez said the funds had been taken from his Bitcoin Beach wallet but he was never able to withdraw the cash via Chivo. He said he had not heard back after he filed complaints. Others have also reported irregularities with transactions and attempts of stolen identity. President Nayib Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues Galvez and others have faced. A spokesperson for the president's office and Chivo could not be reached for comment. By some measures adoption in the poor country, where one fifth of families depends on remittances, has been rapid. Bukele has said three million people have downloaded Chivo, some 500,000 more than initially targeted and roughly half the country's population. In September he said the wallet had 2.1 million active users. One month since launch, 12% of consumers have used the cryptocurrency, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development reported. ""Since yesterday, Salvadorans are inserting more cash (to buy #bitcoin) than what they are withdrawing from the @chivowallet ATMs,"" Bukele tweeted on Wednesday. ""This is very surprising so early in the game."" But the foundation, which polled 233 companies across different sectors, found that the overall use was still low, with 93% of companies reporting no bitcoin payments. ""We're still not sure what benefits the government expected,"" said Leonor Selva of the National Association of Private Enterprises, one of several business groups that remains skeptical about the rollout. MIGRANT MONEY The Bukele government hopes that 2.5 million Salvadorans living in the United States will eventually send remittances through Chivo. So far, 30 bitcoin ATMs to send remittances have been installed in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles and Bukele says around $2 million is being sent via Chivo daily. Juan Moz, a construction worker who has lived in the United States since 2005, recently chose Chivo to send remittances home to his family - a decision he said saves him up to $18 when compared to traditional money transfer services. ""I'm definitely going to keep using it,"" he said in a phone interview from San Francisco. However, most of El Salvador's $6 billion dollars annual remittances - about a quarter of the nation's gross domestic product - still comes via money transfers, with many wary of the cryptocurrency's volatility. Last month, El Salvador bought 700 bitcoins. Prices initially dropped sharply after the Sept. 7 adoption but surged in late September to reach about $54,000 per coin this week. Several people told Reuters they had downloaded the wallet and received a $30 bonus that the government offered at the outset of the program. The handout was big enough that it benefited some small business owners like Alexander Diaz, whose restaurant serving chicken wings saw a spike in business. ""Most of the people who had that bonus wanted to test how it could be spent, so several clients made payments to us with bitcoin,"" Diaz said, adding that some 20% of his customers now use the cryptocurrency. ""Chivo has benefited small entrepreneurs because it makes the payment method easier for customers,"" Diaz said.

Video Games Chronicle had earlier reported that an anonymous hacker had claimed to have leaked Twitch's data, including the source code and information on its clients and unreleased games. Earlier this week, Facebook Inc The social media giant later confirmed that the error was not due to any malicious activity. ""Facebook basically just removed themselves from the Internet but they did not lose any sensitive information.

technology,Automakers funding new tech aimed at making greener lithium for EVs," CALIPATRIA, Calif., Oct 7 (Reuters) - Automakers, investors and even oilfield giant Schlumberger NV Stellantis , Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and others have invested millions of dollars or signed supply agreements with so-called direct lithium extraction (DLE) start-ups in recent months in an attempt to propel the technology to commercial production, expected within the next year or two. DLE technologies use less land and groundwater than hard rock mining and brine evaporation ponds - the traditional ways to process the white metal. Industry analysts see it as a new way to help ensure lithium supply for the EV industry - if the technology can work on a large scale. ""More green lithium is the promise of this new technology,"" said Kasper Sage of BMW i Ventures, BMW's DLE technologies are comparable to common household water softeners, which remove metals from drinking water. The process can take as little as a few hours to filter the metal inside an average-sized warehouse. By contrast, traditional evaporation ponds can be hundreds of acres in size, permanently drain nearby aquifers and take several years to produce lithium. However, most DLE technologies are more expensive to operate than evaporation ponds, which use sunlight, and some require large volumes of freshwater and electricity. Albemarle Corp ""Access to clean water is one of the key hindrances to DLE,"" said John Peichel of Suez PA's Schlumberger, known for its hydraulic fracturing work, is building a DLE project in Nevada and says its ""ultimate goal"" is to produce lithium without any freshwater. It is a goal the U.S. Department of Energy is supporting with a $4 million contest for the best geothermal lithium technological developments. WALL STREET The potential hurdles have not hindered Wall Street's interest in so-called green lithium. Standard Lithium Ltd.'s  shares have risen six-fold since they started trading in New York in July, even though the company's DLE technology is still being piloted in Arkansas. Australia's Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd Chris Berry, an independent industry analyst with House Mountain Partners, says that based on existing announcements, DLE could produce a quarter of global lithium supply by the end of the decade, though he noted not all technologies should be treated as equal. Other industry consultants put that figure even higher. Global demand for lithium last year was about 320,000 tonnes, and is expected to hit 1 million tonnes by 2025 and 3 million tonnes by the end of the decade. ""Investors need to weigh the benefits of DLE technology against a host of challenges in tailoring the technology to each lithium deposit,"" Berry said. One area drawing attention from DLE developers is California's Salton Sea, roughly 160 miles (258 km) southeast of Los Angeles. Superhot brines teeming with lithium swirl under the area, which sits atop the San Andreas Fault. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc Nearby, privately held Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd is developing a geothermal lithium brine project That project, as well as The DLE attention comes as prices for lithium are near all-time highs, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, fueling the race for new technologies. ""Lithium supply is the main bottleneck to electrification and DLE can help boost that supply,"" said Teague Egan, chief executive of Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, a privately held company working with Argentina lithium producer Orocobre Ltd Our Standards: British lender Natwest said on Wednesday it planned to increase lending linked to sustainable and climate-related finance to 100 billion pounds ($136 billion) by 2025."
technology,Google rivals want EU lawmakers to act via new tech rules," BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - DuckDuckGo and three other search engine rivals to Google on Thursday urged EU lawmakers to take action against the Alphabet The European Commission in 2018 levied a record 4.24- billion-euro ($5 billion) fine on Google for unfairly using Android to cement the dominance of its search engine and ordered it to ensure a level playing field for rivals. Google subsequently made changes and four months ago said it would let rivals compete for free to be the default search engines on Android devices in Europe. U.S. search engine DuckDuckGo, Germany's Ecosia and French peers Qwant and Lilo said lawmakers should use tech rules drafted by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to ensure competition. ""Despite recent changes, we do not believe it will move market share significantly due to its persisting limitations,"" they said in a joint letter to European Parliament lawmakers. They said a preference menu that let users choose their search default when setting up an Android device is not available on Chrome desktop or on other operating systems, and that it is only shown once to users. ""The DMA should enshrine in law a requirement for a search engine preference menu that would effectively ban Google from acquiring default search access points of the operating systems and the browsers of gatekeepers,"" they said. The DMA may come into force in 2023 once it gets the green light from EU lawmakers and EU countries.

While the United States has recently enjoyed a bull run in its capital markets, defaults at Chinese property developers tied to the fate of cash-strapped Evergrande, record-high energy costs and inflation have stoked investor worries and market swings. IFIT is the first major company to shelve its IPO in the United States due to this heightened stock market volatility and follows several European companies, including France's Icade Sante, that have put their IPO plans on ice. Allvue Systems Holdings, an alternative investment technology solutions provider, last week said it would postpone its New York IPO, citing adverse market conditions.

Seattle-based Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The proposed class includes more than 10,000 people at five Colorado warehouses. ""Amazon appears fine making efforts to keep its workers safe, so long as the workers are the ones footing the bill,"" David Seligman of nonprofit Towards Justice, which brought the suit, said in a statement. The complaint says that beginning in March 2020 Amazon required employees at Colorado warehouses to arrive early, wait in lines outside the facilities, and then answer questions and check their temperature once they were inside. The process generally took 20 to 60 minutes, according to the lawsuit. That time is compensable under Colorado law, which says workers must be paid when they are required to be on their employer's premises or on duty, according to the suit. Amazon has argued in a similar lawsuit in California federal court that because the screenings primarily benefit workers, they do not amount to compensable time under federal wage law.

technology,EU lawmakers mull changes that could bring European companies under EU tech rules," STRASBOURG, Oct 6 (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers may lower a threshold that determines which companies will be subject to new tech rules, a top EU lawmaker said on Wednesday.

Andreas Schwab, who is steering the DMA through the European Parliament and had proposed a higher market value of 100 billion euros, said EU lawmakers were looking at changing the threshold to a lower figure. ""We have not yet found the final compromise but my draft compromise foresees 80 billion euros,"" Schwab told Reuters in an interview. ""We hope that there will also soon be European companies with the same amount of money and turnover to be in the scope of the DMA as well,"" he said but did not name any company. He said the new figure was based on the methodology used by the European Commission in calculating its proposed threshold. Netherlands-based online travel agency Booking.com's market cap is around $100 billion, based on Refinitiv data. Schwab also said there should be room for national authorities to act following a call by German and French antitrust watchdogs to have more say in enforcing the DMA but critics have said this may lead to fragmentation. ""I believe it is important that we have the right under the DMA for national authorities to go for information requests to the gatekeepers,"" he said. ""But it's obvious that the gatekeeper designation remains with the European Commission and the larger part of the procedures to be done with the Commission.""

technology,Analysis: Tesla would face tough road in any bid to slash $137 mln racial bias verdict in U.S.," Oct 6 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc A federal jury in San Francisco on Monday The jury found that Tesla failed to take steps to prevent race-based harassment of factory workers, including the use of racial slurs and racist graffiti in bathrooms. Tesla also was ordered to pay Diaz $6.9 million in compensatory damages. Punitive damages are designed to punish and to deter future unlawful conduct, while compensatory damages are intended to pay victims for their actual losses. The U.S. Supreme Court If Tesla challenges Monday's verdict, the company will likely point to the fact that the amount of punitive damages is nearly 19 times the compensatory damages, legal experts not involved in the case said. Tesla could also claim the verdict was not supported by evidence, and attempt to settle with Diaz to stave off further litigation over the size of the jury award, the experts said. The Supreme Court guidelines can go out the window if misconduct has a widespread impact on workers and is found to be highly offensive or reprehensible, according to Catherine Sharkey, a professor at New York University School of Law. Since the jury found that Tesla had created a hostile work environment based on race, it follows that allegations that the company tolerated racist speech and graffiti affected other workers and could justify the massive award, she said. ""The idea is that making an employer pay for that widespread harm could lead them to put in place measures to avoid future harm,"" she said. In a memo to employees on Monday, Tesla Vice President Valerie Workman said the company believed the facts of the case did not warrant the large award, and that Tesla took immediate action each of the three times that Diaz complained about racist conduct. Tesla did not responded to requests for comment on a potential appeal. Lawrence Organ, a lawyer for Diaz, said the case was unusual because of evidence of widespread use of the ""N word"" at the Fremont plant and Tesla's failure to address it. ""We would argue that ... the jury got it right, particularly in light of Tesla's financial condition as one of the wealthiest corporations in the world,"" Organ said. Several legal experts said the award for Diaz was among the largest in a U.S. discrimination case involving a single plaintiff. A federal jury in 2014 awarded $186 million to a former AutoZone Stores Inc manager in a pregnancy bias case, which at the time was widely reported in the media to be the largest verdict of its kind. AutoZone moved for a new trial but settled with the plaintiff on undisclosed terms before the motion was decided. The nine-figure award for Diaz is ""pretty unheard of,"" and sends a message to employers that tolerating discrimination can be costly, said David Lopez, a professor at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey who was general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama administration. Tesla has been accused of tolerating race-based harassment at the Fremont plant in several lawsuits aside from Diaz's, including a pending class action in California state court. The company has denied the claims and says it has adopted policies to better address complaints about racially-charged incidents. Lopez said the jurors in Tesla's case likely took into account the pervasiveness of the conduct alleged by Diaz and the company's value and high profile, which could also come into play if the company seeks to lower the jury award. Tesla's market value ""The jury was asking itself, 'what would sting Tesla and make sure they don't treat this as just another cost of doing business?'"" Lopez said.

technology,Stablecoins to face same safeguards as traditional payments," LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Stablecoins would have to comply with the same safeguards as their more traditional competitors in payments under proposals from regulators on Wednesday as authorities get to grips with a rapidly evolving sector. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value relative to traditional currencies, or to a commodity such as gold, to avoid the volatility that makes bitcoin and other digital tokens impractical for most commerce. Facebook Inc's Since then, Diem has radically scaled back its ambitions and plans to launch a U.S. dollar stablecoin. The IOSCO group of securities regulators and the Bank for International Settlements, a global forum for central banks, set out on Wednesday how current rules for major clearing, settlement and payments services should also be applied to 'systemic' or heavily used stablecoins. The proposals, put out to public consultation before being finalised early next year, put into practice what regulators have long called for: the same rules for the same type of business and accompanying risks. The rules mean a stablecoin operator must set up a legal entity which spells out how it is governed and manages operational risks like cyber attacks. Though still little-used for commerce, the use of stablecoins in crypto trading has grown rapidly as retail and larger investors warmed to the emerging asset class during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tether, the largest stablecoin, has a market capitalisation of around $68 billion versus just $15 billion a year ago. The value of circulating USD Coin, another major stablecoin, has also jumped dramatically to over $30 billion from just $2.7 billion a year ago, according to CoinMarketCap. Countries that allow stablecoins to operate would be required to apply the principles as part of their affiliation to IOSCO and the BIS. ""This report marks significant progress in understanding the implications of stablecoin arrangements for the financial system and providing clear and practical guidance on the standards they need to meet to maintain its integrity,"" IOSCO Chair Ashley Alder said in a statement. The proposals do not cover issues specific to stablecoins pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, which are being considered separately.

technology,NSO ended Pegasus contract with UAE over Dubai leader's hacking," LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The Israeli-based NSO Group ended its contract with the United Arab Emirates to use its powerful ""Pegasus"" state spyware tool because Dubai's ruler was using it to hack the phones of his ex-wife and some close to her, her lawyers told England's High Court. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE, instructed the The hacking took place last year during the couple's ongoing multi-million dollar custody battle in London over their two children. During the hearings, the court heard that NSO had cancelled its contract with the UAE for breaching its rules on ""Whenever a suspicion of a misuse arises, NSO investigates, NSO alerts, NSO terminates,"" NSO, which only licenses its software to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies, said in a statement after the rulings were published. It said it had shut down six systems of past customers, contracts worth more than $300 million. NSO did not go into specifics. The sheikh rejected the court's conclusions, saying they were based on an incomplete picture. ""I have always denied the allegations made against me and I continue to do so,"" he said in a statement. The hacking of Haya and those connected to her, including her lawyer Fiona Shackleton, a lawmaker in Britain's House of Lords, came to light at the start of August last year. A cyber expert studying the possible use of Pegasus against a UAE activist realised the phones were being hacked and passed on the information, according to documents and evidence given to the court. At the same time, NSO were alerted by a whistleblower that the software was being misused to target Haya and her legal team, a source familiar with the company told Reuters. It immediately informed Cherie Blair, a high-profile British lawyer hired by NSO to work as an external adviser on human rights, to get a warning to the princess. Within two hours, the company shut down the customer's system and then prevented any other client from being able to use Pegasus to target British numbers, a measure still in place today, the source said. PROBLEM Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, said in a statement to the court: ""During a conversation with the NSO senior manager, I recall asking him whether their client was the big state or the little state, the manager clarified it was the little state which I took to be the state of Dubai."" She told Shackleton that NSO had immediately stopped the country involved using Pegasus, and had demanded answers. ""Cherie Blair said if they weren't using the software to find genuine terrorists, they had a problem,"" Haya's lawyer Charles Geekie told the court. ""Her client did not want to be connected to this type of behaviour and wanted to help."" In a letter to the court on Dec. 14 last year, NSO said it had cancelled its contract with its client, who the company declined to identify. ""As the NSO letter of December 2020 makes plain, after its investigation NSO has adopted the extreme remedy of terminating its customer's use of the Pegasus software,"" Judge Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division in England and Wales, said in his ruling. ""In commercial terms, this step is to be understood as having great significance."" In recent months, NSO's Pegasus has become the focus of international attention following several reports that the spyware was being used by governments to illicitly target human rights campaigners, journalists and politicians. In October 2019, WhatsApp sued NSO, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across four continents with targets including diplomats, political dissidents and senior government officials. The firm had about 45 countries as customers, but had refused to do business with 90 others because they couldn't trust them over human rights issues, the source said.

technology,'A coward's palace': Australian PM slams social media amid defamation law controversy," SYDNEY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister lambasted social media on Thursday as ""a coward's palace"", saying platforms should be treated as publishers when defamatory comments by unidentified people are posted, pouring fuel on a raging debate over the country's libel laws. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's comments suggest he would favour making companies like Facebook Inc The country's highest court ruled last month that publishers can be held liable for public comments on online forums, a judgement that has pitted Facebook and news organisations against each other and spread alarm among all sectors that engage with the public via social media. That in turn has lent new urgency to an ongoing review of Australia's defamation laws, with the federal attorney general this week writing to state counterparts stressing the importance of tackling the issue. ""Social media has become a coward's palace where people can go on there, not say who they are, destroy people's lives, and say the most foul and offensive things to people, and do so with impunity,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""They should have to identify who they are, and the companies, if they're not going to say who they are, well, they're not a platform anymore, they're a publisher. You can expect us to be leaning further into this,"" he added. A Facebook spokesperson did not directly respond to a Reuters question about Morrison's remarks, but said the company was actively engaging with the review. ""We support modernisation of Australia's uniform defamation laws and hope for greater clarity and certainty in this area,"" the spokesperson said. ""Recent court decisions have reaffirmed the need for such law reform."" A representative for Twitter Inc's Since the court ruling, CNN, which is owned by AT&T Inc Australia has butted heads with Facebook previously, enacting a new law this year that forces it and Google REVIEW IN FOCUS Federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash said in an Oct. 6 letter to state counterparts that she had ""received considerable feedback from stakeholders regarding the potential implications of the High Court's decision"". ""While I refrain from commenting on the merits of the Court's decision, it is clear ... that our work to ensure that defamation law is fit-for-purpose in the digital age remains critical,"" said the letter which was seen by Reuters. No timeline has been given for how long the review might last. New South Wales state Attorney General Mark Speakman, who is leading it, said media, social media and law firms attended three consultations in the past month. The review, which has been running through 2021, has published 36 submissions on its website, including one from Facebook which says it should not be held liable for defamatory comments since it has relatively little ability to monitor and remove content posted under publishers' pages. While news outlets were among the first to criticise the ruling, lawyers have warned all Australian sectors which rely on social media to interact with the public are potentially liable. ""The decision has significant implications for those who operate online forums ... which allow third-parties to make comments,"" a Law Council of Australia spokesperson said. ""It is not limited to news organisations."" The leaders of the state of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, home to Canberra, are among those who have disabled comments from Facebook pages, citing the High Court ruling.

The upcoming changes will make it mandatory for ""higher-risk"" rail transit companies and ""critical"" U.S. airport and aircraft operators to do three things: name a chief cyber official, disclose hacks to the government and draft recovery plans for if an attack were to occur. The planned regulations come after ""Whether by air, land, or sea, our transportation systems are of utmost strategic importance to our national and economic security,"" Mayorkas said.

Rafail Portnoy, Chief Technology Officer with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it is ""constantly vigilant against this global threat, and will ensure compliance with any TSA regulations.""

The unit of U.S. tech company Alphabet Inc Nitin Gajria, managing director for Google in Africa told Reuters in a virtual interview that the company would among others, target startups focusing on fintech, e-commerce and local language content. ""We are looking at areas that may have some strategic overlap with Google and where Google could potentially add value in partnering with some of these startups,"" Gajria said. In collaboration with not-for-profit organisation Kiva, Google will also provide $10 million in low interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa so they can get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19. Small businesses in Africa often struggle to get capital because they lack the necessary collateral required by banks in case they default. When credit is available, interest rates are usually too high.

The group will include a mix of anti-money laundering and cybersecurity experts. ""Cryptocurrency exchanges want to be the banks of the future, well we need to make sure that folks can have confidence when they're using these systems and we need to be poised to root out abuse,"" Monaco said. ""The point is to protect consumers."" Cybercriminals that attack U.S. companies with ransomware, a type of malware that encrypts systems and demands payment, are typically paid in cryptocurrency. The hackers often use a mix of different cryptocurrency services to accept and transfer these payments, helping hide them from law enforcement. Monaco also announced the creation of a civil cyber fraud initiative, which will ""use civil enforcement tools to pursue companies, those who are government contractors, who receive federal funds, when they fail to follow recommended cybersecurity standards."" ""For too long, companies have chosen silence under the mistaken belief that its less risky to hide a breach than to bring it forward and report it. That changes today,"" Monaco said. The announcements come after several high profile cyberattacks earlier this year against U.S. companies and government agencies.

Facebook, the world's largest social network, has been blasted by over a lack of transparency into how its platforms work, its handling of user data and the impact of its sites on users. Haugen, a former product manager at the company who leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal, said the profit motive was strong enough that Facebook, which owns Instagram, would not change without pressure. ""Until incentives change at Facebook, we should not expect Facebook to change. We need action from Congress,"" she said. Haugen also said that if she were made CEO of Facebook, she would immediately establish a policy that would allow it to share internal research with Congress and other oversight bodies, calling for transparency and public scrutiny of Facebook's systems and decisions. Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford Law School professor who resigned last year from an effort aiming to get Facebook to share more data with researchers, has argued for legislation to compel social media companies to share their data with external researchers. ""The platforms thrive in secrecy and if you subject them to outside review, it will change their behavior,"" he said. Persily said that as action is needed within the next year, he favored the Federal Trade Commission managing the process. ""You go to war with the army you have, not the army you may want,"" he said, though he said a new cabinet department could later be created. Former Facebook executive Brian Boland, who was in charge of the company's partnership data before resigning this year, said improving transparency was ""step one in any kind of regulatory regime."" Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he envisaged a new, separate agency with the bandwidth and specialism to establish and enforce standards for Big Tech, including on privacy. On Tuesday, Facebook spokeswoman Lina Pietsch said the company had itself long asked for government oversight. ""We have been calling for updated regulations ourselves for two and a half years,"" she said. Facebook has previously Some commentators raised caveats around the idea: Kyle Taylor, program director for a group of critics called the Real Facebook Oversight Board, said a regulator was essential but cautioned against creating a ""revolving door"" of ex-employees from social media companies joining the body. Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St. John's University Law School who studies social media governance, tweeted that such an agency should not be in charge of misinformation as an issue. REGULATION AND REFORM During Tuesday's hearing, Haugen also encouraged lawmakers to reform Section 230. She urged the law be changed to hold companies accountable for their algorithms, which often decide what social media users see when they sign in. ""They (companies) have 100% control over their algorithms and Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth and virality and reactiveness over public safety. They shouldn't get a free pass on that because they're paying for their profits right now with our safety,"" she said. Facebook has said it is in favor of a reform of Section 230 to give the companies immunity from liability only if they follow best practices. At the hearing, lawmakers did not push back at Haugen's suggestions for various reforms but, in many cases, pointed to legislation aimed along similar lines. A bipartisan group of senators, including Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, introduced a bill in June that would require big internet platforms to allow users to view content that has not been decided by an algorithm. Haugen also encouraged raising age limits for users of Facebook's platforms from 13 to 16 or 18, given addiction issues on the sites and children's issues with self-regulation. Under current law, children 12 and under have more protection online than teenagers. There is a bill before Congress to raise the age to 15, among other changes.

technology,ServiceNow announces partnership with Germany's Celonis," BERLIN, Oct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. technology platform ServiceNow The partnership includes ServiceNow making an unspecified investment in Celonis and will combine ServiceNow's workflow platform with the execution management system of Celonis that crunches data to tackle problems and automate decision making. Celonis, a competitor to German business software company SAP Co-Chief Executive Alexander Rinke, who co-founded Celonis with fellow students from the Technical University of Munich in 2011, told Reuters the partners would be launching joint products as early as the first half of 2022. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott, who led SAP for a decade until 2019, said he was looking forward to working with Rinke: ""We have known each other for ages and have been good friends for a long time."" McDermott compared the work of Celonis to an x-ray that shows what is broken and what needs to be changed: ""ServiceNow will build on this with new processes."" Celonis initially developed and marketed process-mining software that enabled clients to analyse swathes of data thrown off by modern company operations and find ways to improve their business processes. It rebranded as an Execution Management platform after acquiring Czech peer Integromat last year, and will invest proceeds of the recent fundraising in enabling its software to give better recommendations and take smarter decisions.

technology,Gaming apps block access in India's Silicon Valley state as ban takes effect," BENGALURU, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Sequoia Capital-funded Mobile Premier League (MPL) was among the first few gaming startups that began blocking access to users in the Indian state of Karnataka on Wednesday following a ban on online gaming. The law, which came into effect late on Tuesday, bans online games involving betting and wagering, and ""any act or risking money, or otherwise on the unknown result of an event including on a game of skill"". The latest ban has intensified concerns that growing state regulations could hit the nascent but booming gaming sector in India, where foreign investors have pumped in millions of dollars in recent months. On Wednesday morning, MPL's gaming app showed messages to users in Karnataka that said: ""Sorry! The law in your state does not permit you to play Fantasy sports"", ""Fantasy games are locked"" and ""cash games are locked"". The gaming app offers fantasy cricket and football games and allows real-money wagering on them. Dream11, one of India's most popular gaming apps backed by Tiger Global, was still operational, but Paytm First Games was not. Dream11 declined to comment, while MPL and Paytm did not immediately respond. Karnataka, home to some of the world's biggest tech companies and India's tech capital Bengaluru, is the latest Indian state that has banned such online games after Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu had also imposed such bans, but its bill was struck down by its high court.

technology,YouTube drops R&B singer R. Kelly's official channels," Oct 5 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's R.

technology,Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber valued at $1.9 bln after fund raise," BENGALURU, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Indian cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch Kuber said on Wednesday it had raised over $260 million at a valuation of $1.9 billion, underscoring the rise in popularity of crypto trading in the country even as government policy remains unclear. The new funding round included new investors such as venture capital firms Coinbase Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, and existing investors Paradigm, Ribbit Capital, Sequoia Capital India and Tiger Global, CoinSwitch said. India's digital currency market has grown from $923 million in April 2020 to $6.6 billion in May 2021, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. CoinSwitch, which competes with cryptocurrency platforms including WazirX and CoinDCX in India, has over 10 million users in the country with a monthly active user base of over seven million. The company added it was now the country's largest crypto asset platform. Reuters could not independently verify the claim. CoinSwitch said it would use the funds to onboard 50 million Indians on its platform and roll out new products. Bengaluru-based CoinSwitch, founded in 2017, was launched as a global aggregator of crypto exchanges. It started its India operations in June last year.

technology,Special Report: How AT&T helped build far-right One America News," SAN DIEGO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - One America News, the far-right network whose fortunes and viewership rose amid the triumph and tumult of the Trump administration, has flourished with support from a surprising source: AT&T Inc, the world's largest communications company. A Reuters review of court records shows the role AT&T played in creating and funding OAN, a network that continues to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic. OAN founder and chief executive Robert Herring Sr has testified that the inspiration to launch OAN in 2013 came from AT&T executives. ?�They told us they wanted a conservative network,??Herring said during a 2019 deposition seen by Reuters. ?�They only had one, which was Fox News, and they had seven others on the other [leftwing] side. When they said that, I jumped to it and built one.??Since then, AT&T has been a crucial source of funds flowing into OAN, providing tens of millions of dollars in revenue, court records show. Ninety percent of OAN?�s revenue came from a contract with AT&T-owned television platforms, including satellite broadcaster DirecTV, according to 2020 sworn testimony by an OAN accountant. Herring has testified he was offered $250 million for OAN in 2019. Without the DirecTV deal, the accountant said under oath, the network?�s value ?�would be zero.??Dallas-based AT&T, a mobile-phone and Internet provider, also owns entertainment giant Warner Media, which includes CNN and HBO. AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 and in August spun off the satellite service, retaining a 70% share in the new, independently managed company. AT&T?�s total U.S. television subscriber base, including satellite and streaming services, fell from 26 million in 2015 to 15.4 million as of August. AT&T spokesman Jim Greer declined to comment on the testimony about OAN?�s revenue streams, citing confidentiality agreements. He said that DirecTV broadcasts ?�many news channels that offer viewpoints across the political spectrum.???�We have always sought to provide a wide variety of content and programming that would be of interest to customers, and do not dictate or control programming on channels we carry,??Greer said. ?�Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.??After this story was published, AT&T issued a statement saying it has ?�never had a financial interest in OAN's success and does not 'fund' OAN.??Although the contracts are confidential, in court filings Herring cited monthly fees included in one five-year deal with AT&T. According to an AT&T filing citing Herring?�s numbers, those fees would total about $57 million. Greer said that figure is inaccurate, but declined to say how much AT&T has paid to air OAN, citing a non-disclosure agreement. Herring and his adult sons own and operate OAN, a subsidiary of their closely held San Diego-based Herring Networks. Their AT&T deal includes Herring?�s other network, a little-watched lifestyle channel, AWE. The Herrings declined interview requests. Herring, who just turned 80, is a self-made businessman who amassed a fortune in the circuit board industry, then turned to television and boxing promotion. OAN?�s influence rose in late 2015, when it began covering Trump rallies live, at a time when some of the media still saw the New York celebrity businessman as a longshot presidential contender. The network continues to shower Trump with attention and often provides a friendly platform for his Republican allies. As president, Trump frequently urged supporters to watch OAN. In his final two years in office, Trump touted the network, known as @OANN online, to his 88 million Twitter followers at least 120 times. ?�Hope everybody is watching @OANN right now,??Trump tweeted on December 1, citing a dubious report about a truck carrying more than 100,000 fake ballots. ?�Other media afraid to show.??The state and federal court documents reviewed by Reuters detail a lucrative relationship for OAN with AT&T, even as the two occasionally tangled in court. The records include a reported offer by AT&T to acquire a 5% equity stake in OAN and AWE, though the two sides ultimately signed a different deal. The court filings also cite a promise by OAN to ?�cast a positive light??on AT&T during newscasts. The confidential OAN financial records are drawn in part from testimony, including by Herring and the accountant, generated during a labor lawsuit brought against OAN by a former employee and unrelated to AT&T. When that case went to trial last year, the network?�s lawyer told the jury that AT&T was keeping OAN afloat. ?�If Herring Networks, for instance, was to lose or not be renewed on DirecTV, the company would go out of business tomorrow,??OAN lawyer Patrick Nellies told the court, a transcript shows. Researchers who tracked the rise of conservative media pillars Rush Limbaugh and Fox News see similarities between those pioneers to One America News and other new rightwing networks, particularly during their formative years. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the births of Fox News and OAN share common threads: money and opportunity. She noted that the late Republican operative Roger Ailes had the foresight in the 1990s to recommend that Fox create a conservative news network. ?�If somebody recognizes there?�s a market for something and there?�s a lot of money attached to that market, you get a news outlet,??Jamieson said. ?�So this is AT&T playing the Roger Ailes role.??Greer, the AT&T spokesman, called that comparison ?�a ridiculous claim,??noting that other distributors also carry OAN. A BOOST FROM THE INSURRECTION America?�s post-election turmoil, punctuated by the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, continues to roil the country. Dozens of election administrators in battleground states Trump lost have received a barrage of death threats, Reuters has reported. A Reuters poll in May showed that a quarter of Americans ??and 53% of Republicans ??wrongly believe Trump won the 2020 election. OAN caters to this audience. Trump?�s loss was OAN?�s gain, social media data show. The network?�s online audience soared in November, after conservative mainstay and OAN competitor Fox News affirmed Joe Biden?�s victory. Trump and his camp blasted Fox. A record 767,000 people installed the OAN app that month, nine times as many as in October, according to data firm Sensor Tower. In January, Trump supporters, including at least one carrying an OAN flag, stormed the U.S. Capitol. That month, app installs spiked again to 517,000. The OAN website averages 8 million visits a month from desktop and mobile users, having peaked at 15 million from November through January, data firm Similarweb found in an analysis for Reuters. Two in three people on desktop computers return to the website after an initial visit, about the same loyalty rate as Fox News and Newsmax, another rival conservative news channel. One America?�s television ratings are harder to measure, partly because it is available in only about a quarter of the estimated 121 million TV households in the United States. Ratings services Nielsen and Comscore, which both show that Fox News continues to be the leading cable network, do not release OAN figures. In an internal email, an OAN news director told staff that the week of the Capitol assault produced the network?�s ?�best ever??ratings, but gave no statistics. OAN says it is the fourth-rated news network, behind Fox, CNN and MSNBC, and ahead of CNBC, the BBC and Newsmax, but has not provided figures to back this up. (Each of these networks, including One America News, pays Reuters fees to publish the news service?�s stories, videos and/or pictures.) Even so, the number of viewers OAN reaches may be less important than the kind of observers it attracts and galvanizes, said John Watson, an American University journalism professor specializing in ethics and media law. ?�If you have 12 Americans being fed a diet of untruth, that?�s 12 too many ??and here, it?�s literally millions,??Watson said of the OAN audience. ?�When you have that sort of poisonous influence on mass media, it?�s a problem; because elections in the United States tend to be so close, a few percentage points here or there can really make a difference.??At least one self-described regular OAN viewer recently sent a threatening note to an election official. In August, Sheila Garcia of Riverside County, California, sent Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold a scathing message. Biden beat Trump in Colorado, and Garcia accused Griswold, the state?�s top election official, of treason ??warning her that punishments for that crime are hanging and legal injection. ?�Within several months you will have to decide between the two,??Garcia wrote. In an interview, Griswold said she considered threats like Garcia's message a credible threat on her life. That threat and dozens of others caused her to seek extra security measures, she said. Garcia, 55, told Reuters she?�s convinced Biden stole the election and said she gets most of her news from OAN. She compared U.S. mainstream media to state propaganda outlets in China and Cuba. Her message to Griswold, she said, was legal. ?�If you're afraid of a little old lady in a trailer park in California, I feel sorry for you,??she said in an interview. Neil W. McCabe, OAN?�s former Washington bureau chief and now national political correspondent for The Tennessee Star, rejects the idea that the network is a toxic influence. He said OAN serves an important public role and has earned loyalty from viewers who share a similar world view. ?�When you give a voice to the voiceless, you?�re going to bond with them,??McCabe told Reuters. ?�Who else is doing these stories???In several instances, records show, the network broadcast statements and theories that were proven false. YouTube suspended OAN from making money off its YouTube channel last year for, among other things, repeatedly violating its COVID-19 policy, which prohibits content claiming there?�s a guaranteed cure. OAN touts hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug promoted by Trump, without scientific evidence, as a cure for COVID. During last summer?�s Black Lives Matter protests, OAN aired an unconfirmed report that an elderly demonstrator in Buffalo, New York, who was knocked down and seriously injured by police was trying to jam the cops??radios. Trump, citing the OAN story, tweeted that the man ?�could be an ANTIFA provocateur.??The false accusation went viral. In the two days after the OAN broadcast, one-third of all online references cited the network, an analysis compiled by Zignal Labs for Reuters found. On January 6, after Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol, an OAN news director cautioned staff via email, ?�Please DO NOT say ?�Trump Supporters Storm Capitol ?��?Simply call them demonstrators or protestors ??DO NOT CALL IT A RIOT!!!??A day later, Herring suggested the riot might be a false-flag operation by the leftwing Antifa movement. ?�We want to report all the things Antifa did yesterday. I don?�t think it was Trump people but lets investigate,??he emailed OAN producers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says there is no evidence of Antifa involvement in the riot. All but a handful of the some 600 suspects charged so far have been rightwing Trump backers. The next day, Herring tweeted: ?�If anyone thinks we will throw the best President America has had, in my 79 years, under the bus, you are wrong. We will continue to give him honest coverage.??His network went on to support Trump in an unusual way: OAN allowed two reporters to raise $605,000 to help fund a ?�private??audit of the presidential vote in Arizona, despite Republican officials??assurances that Biden won the state. According to an OAN executive, they did so with the network?�s blessing but in a private capacity. One of the OAN reporters, Christina Bobb, also worked part-time for the Trump recount legal team, according to a recent deposition by Trump?�s then-lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. An OAN executive confirmed the arrangement. Bobb, a lawyer and former Trump administration official, did not reply to a request for comment. Five former OAN producers said in interviews that they found the practice of reporters raising funds for events they cover unethical, but said OAN?�s move did not surprise them. ?�If there was any story involving Trump, we had to only focus on either the positive information or basically create positive information,??said Marissa Gonzales, an OAN producer from 2019 until she resigned in 2020. ?�It was never, never the full truth.??Since March, OAN has sold hours of infomercial time to MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a leading purveyor of false claims the election was stolen. Lindell has used that time on OAN to repeatedly broadcast his election conspiracy ?�docu-movies.??A primary Lindell target is Dominion Voting Systems Inc, whose machines count votes in 28 states and use paper ballots and records for auditing. In August, Dominion sued OAN for defamation. ?�OAN saw a business opportunity??and fueled bogus conspiracies about alleged vote tampering, Dominion contended. ?�OAN helped create and cultivate an alternate reality where up is down, pigs have wings,??the lawsuit said. The network?�s lawyers have said in letters to Dominion that the election coverage is protected free speech and that the Lindell programs include a disclaimer that they are ?�opinions only and are not intended to be taken or interpreted by the viewer as established facts.??Other Trump supporters, including Lindell and lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell, offered a similar free speech defense in related lawsuits brought by Dominion. In August, a federal judge said the Lindell, Giuliani and Powell cases should proceed toward trial, noting that the Constitution does not necessarily offer ?�blanket immunity for statements that are political in nature.??Generally, the network runs few commercials compared to its competitors, and former bureau chief McCabe said the paucity of advertising is a kind of superpower. The network?�s reliance on fees from cable, satellite and streaming providers, instead of commercials, inoculates it from advertiser boycotts faced by counterparts such as Fox News and rightwing online news site Breitbart, in McCabe?�s view. ?�Because they basically live off the cable and satellite fees, nobody can organize a protest against One America News,??McCabe said. AT&T & OAN: ORIGIN STORY From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, Robert Herring Sr, with sons Charles and Robert Jr, created highly successful and profitable circuit board companies. They sold one such business in 1988 for about $52 million and another two in 2000 for $122 million. In 2004, they created a television network called WealthTV, a channel dedicated to affluent lifestyles ??yachts, mega-mansions and private jets. It proved to be a tough sell. Most cable and satellite providers declined to carry it, even when the Herrings offered WealthTV at a discount, or even for free, just to get it on air. ?�We went to every place you could think of, begging to get on,??Herring said last year on his network. In 2007 and 2008, Herring petitioned the Federal Communications Commission and courts for help, alleging that the large cable providers favored networks they owned or co-owned, discriminating against independent broadcasters like him. The providers countered that they had the right to broadcast channels they believed provided the best content. The FCC concluded that the providers had exercised appropriate business discretion and a federal court affirmed that decision. The Herring litigation irritated some providers, lawyers for two carriers told Reuters, making it even harder to get WealthTV on cable or satellite. Still, the Herrings say they developed a good relationship with AT&T, which began carrying WealthTV in 2006 through U-verse, an Internet set-top box service that can access live TV and video on demand. By 2012, WealthTV had evolved, carrying news updates and live boxing. The Herrings were keen to leverage their existing production facilities in San Diego to launch a second network, either a boxing channel or news outlet. In a pivotal moment for the company, the Herrings say in court filings, depositions and sworn statements, unidentified AT&T executives told them there was an audience for another conservative news network. Herring seized the opportunity. In his 2019 deposition in the labor suit unrelated to AT&T, the elder Herring said he created OAN for two reasons. ?�To make money, number one,??Robert Herring said. ?�But number two, is that AT&T told us ??they wanted a conservative network.??The lawyer questioning Herring, Rodney Diggs, followed up. ?�So,??the lawyer said, ?�AT&T kind of dictated the kind of network that they wanted. Because there was an opportunity, you jumped at it????�Yes, sir,??Herring replied. EQUITY, CELEBRATION, SURPRISE A few months after launching OAN in July 2013, AT&T proposed acquiring a 5% stake in Herring Networks. In a sworn statement, OAN president Charles Herring said he accepted the oral offer in October 2013. Emails show that the two sides executed a non-disclosure agreement that December and that AT&T due-diligence executives visited the Herrings in San Diego in January 2014. But the equity proposal did not materialize into a signed contract. Instead, in April 2014 the two sides signed a more conventional deal: AT&T agreed to pay the Herrings 18 cents per subscriber on U-verse each month for five years. AT&T had 5.7 million U-verse subscribers. Suddenly, after years of rejection, the Herrings were players. The joy lasted less than a month. In May 2014, AT&T announced that it planned to acquire the satellite service DirecTV, which had 20 million TV subscribers at the time. This alarmed the Herrings because their deal with AT&T was limited to U-verse. If AT&T moved all its U-verse customers to DirecTV, the Herrings feared they might receive nothing, court filings show. OAN would lose millions of potential viewers. To prevent that, Charles Herring hustled to Los Angeles to see a key AT&T executive. LOBBYING FOR AT&T That executive, according to Charles Herring?�s sworn account in a lawsuit the Herrings would later file against AT&T, was Aaron Slator, then AT&T?�s president of content and advertising. Slator told him AT&T needed help to allay FCC and other officials??concern that the DirecTV deal ??a consolidation of providers ??might make it harder for independent networks to get on the air, Charles Herring said. So, he said in the affidavit, Slator proposed a new deal: If the Herrings lobbied on AT&T?�s behalf, AT&T would air OAN and WealthTV on both U-verse and DirecTV. The Herrings would be paid one-third less per subscriber, but because DirecTV had so many more subscribers, the deal could be worth $100 million over five years. The Herrings got to work. Charles Herring hired a Washington lobbyist and met with FCC officials, FCC records show. He says he signed a filing of support ?�ghostwritten by AT&T??and sent it to the FCC. He says he attended a $50,000-per-person Republican fundraiser as part of the campaign. The Herrings even offered to air positive news about AT&T on OAN, the network said in its lawsuit against AT&T, which said it could not comment on the litigation. ?�Herring?�s support of AT&T ran deep,??the Herrings??lawyers wrote. ?�Herring invited AT&T to utilize OAN?�s news programs to cast a positive light on the acquisition and advocated for other issues affecting AT&T?�s business.??In court records, AT&T denied it made such a deal to carry OAN on DirecTV if the Herrings lobbied for the merger. ?�Support for the merger was never a condition of or part of any content agreement,??an AT&T spokesperson recently told Reuters. Slator, no longer with AT&T, could not be reached for comment. Another former senior AT&T executive told Reuters the company never made quid-pro-quo offers linking network deals to political support. ?�You just don?�t mix the two,??he said. In any event, the former executive said, such lobbying by a conservative news channel would be implausible or ineffective because it would have come during the presidency of Barack Obama, a Democrat. ?�The Herrings were not going to have influence with Obama?�s people,??said the former AT&T official. The FCC approved the AT&T-DirecTV deal in July 2015. The Herrings say AT&T still refused to put OAN and WealthTV on DirecTV, leaving them only on the shrinking U-verse platform. In March 2016, the Herrings sued AT&T, alleging it had broken an oral promise. AT&T denied any wrongdoing, issuing a statement at the time that said, ?�This lawsuit is simply a ploy by Herring to negotiate a slanted deal.??The Herrings won a key pretrial ruling from a federal judge, however, and in March 2017, the case was settled on undisclosed terms. A month later, OAN and WealthTV (since renamed AWE) began appearing on DirecTV. KEEPING HIS NETWORK On February 5, 2020, the U.S. Senate, sitting as a jury during Trump?�s first impeachment trial in Washington, acquitted him of abusing his power for asking Ukraine?�s president to launch an investigation into then-candidate Biden. On the same afternoon, in a San Diego courtroom, Robert Herring sat before a different jury, the one that heard evidence from the OAN accountant in the employment case. The jury had already found that OAN had wrongly fired the former producer for filing a racial complaint. Now, the jury was considering punitive damages. To help determine an appropriate penalty, the law allowed the jury to hear testimony about OAN's financial condition. In addition to testifying that AT&T provided 90% of Herring Networks??income, the accountant said the company?�s book value ??the net value of its assets ??was a modest $16.6 million. When Herring took the witness stand, he said OAN?�s market value was far higher. He confirmed a 2020 Wall Street Journal report that pro-Trump private equity investors sought to buy OAN for $250 million. Herring told the court he had given the group a few exclusive months to come up with the money but that it had only raised $35 million. ?�No way I would sell for $35 million,??Herring testified. For nearly four decades, Herring had worked closely with his sons to build several successful businesses, including OAN. The network, he said, carried sentimental value. ?�I am not sure I want to sell for anything,??he said.

technology,Investors eye Big Tech as stock market wobbles," NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Technology stocks are bearing the brunt of a recent market selloff, putting a spotlight on how an extended downturn in the sector could weigh on broader equity indexes. After Monday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 technology sector The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite The tumble comes amid a cluster of worries that hit markets in recent weeks, including a looming unwind of the Federal Reserve's easy money policies, a jump in Treasury yields and a nasty battle among lawmakers over the U.S. debt ceiling. Many investors are hesitant to cut their exposure to technology-focused stocks, which have led markets for most of the last decade and are expected to deliver strong earnings growth even if the economic climate worsens. Previous dips over the years have often been met by furious buying. Still, a heavy weighting in broader indexes, comparatively elevated valuations and wide ownership have led some investors to worry over the repercussions of a prolonged period of underperformance for tech and tech-related names. Here are a few of the metrics investors are studying as they weigh whether to stay the course in tech or pare back their holdings: A CROWDED TRADE Years of solid performance have made tech stocks a mainstay in portfolios across Wall Street, periodically spurring concerns that they may be susceptible to violent market swings if investors try to sell all at once. Facebook At the same time, 40% of fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research in September said buying U.S. technology stocks was the market's most crowded trade, a designation tech stocks have received for three straight months. WEIGHTING IN THE S&P 500 The tech sector by itself holds a 27.7% weighting in the S&P 500, more than twice that of the number two sector, healthcare VALUATIONS The technology sector trades at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with 20.7 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datastream. While growth and technology stocks have typically commanded greater valuations in recent years, some market participants worry that the category's reputation for delivering gains year after year has helped stretch their prices beyond levels that may be justified by fundamentals. EARNINGS The tech sector's earnings held up much better than those of the broader market last year as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked widespread economic havoc. As the world emerges from lockdowns this year, tech's profit growth has not been quite as strong as S&P 500 companies overall.

""We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don't want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed."" During a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing, whistleblower Frances Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them. ""As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable,"" said Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team. She left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents. ""The company?�s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won?�t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,"" Haugen said. (Also Read: In an era when bipartisanship is rare in Washington, lawmakers from both parties excoriated the company, illustrating the rising anger in Congress with Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said he was concerned how Facebook and subsidiaries like Instagram affected the mental health of children.

""Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror,"" Blumenthal said. Blumenthal said after the hearing that he would want to ask Zuckerberg why he rejected recommendations to make products safer for users. Zuckerberg, in his post, said Facebook would not stop researching its societal impact.

""We don't agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about,"" Facebook spokeswoman Lena Pietsch said. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, accused Facebook of turning a blind eye to children below age 13 on its services. ""It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users,"" she said. Last week, Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, defended the company in front of Congress and said that it was seeking to release Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Commerce Committee, said she would write Facebook to insist that it not delete documents related to Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority Rohingya. An aide said she would ask for broader retention of documents.

technology,UK regulator demands video platforms do more to protect users," LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Online video sharing platforms (VSPs), such as TikTok, Snapchat and OnlyFans, need to provide clear rules on content, allow users to flag harmful videos, and restrict access to pornographic material, Britain's media regulator Ofcom said. Under laws that came into effect in Britain last year, VSPs must take appropriate steps to protect all of their users from illegal material, with a particular focus on under 18s. Ofcom, which is responsible for enforcing the rules, published guidance for VSPs on Wednesday, saying it wanted to see noticeable improvements over time in safety processes and complaint procedures. Chief Executive Melanie Dawes said online video played a huge role in people's lives, particularly for children, but many users saw hateful, violent or inappropriate material while using them. ""The platforms where these videos are shared now have a legal duty to take steps to protect their users,"" she said. ""So we're stepping up our oversight of these tech companies, while also gearing up for the task of tackling a much wider range of online harms in the future."" Ofcom said its research showed that a third of users said they had witnessed or experienced hateful content; a quarter claimed they'd been exposed to violent or disturbing content; while one in five had seen content that encouraged racism. The regulator's remit covers platforms established in Britain, numbering 18 initially. Platforms established in other countries, such as YouTube and Facebook, are excluded. If it finds a VSP had failed to take appropriate measures to protect users, it will be able to investigate and take action, including fines or - in the most serious cases - suspending or restricting the service.

technology,WhatsApp outage hits trading in assets from crypto to Russian oil," LONDON/MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - WhatsApp's nearly six-hour long outage on Monday hit trading of assets from cryptocurrencies to Russian oil, market players said, although a quick shift to alternative platforms such as Telegram limited severe disruption. Despite many financial institutions discouraging employees from using messaging services such as WhatsApp and other Facebook platforms that went down on Monday, their convenience has made them popular among traders communicating with clients in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Facebook Inc Among those affected was BCB Group, a London-based crypto firm that offers OTC trading as well as other services. Facebook's services went dark at around noon Eastern time (1600 GMT), a key window for BCB's traders. ""The WhatsApp outage hit us in our busiest trading period where we face U.S. counterparties,"" said Chief Executive Oliver von-Landsberg Sadie. ""Day-on-day volume was down 15% on the average daily, which we're internally attributing to the connectivity issues. Telegram and Slack-based trading was on par with daily averages."" WhatsApp usage among financial traders tracked by communications surveillance firm VoxSmart has boomed as banks accept that clients want to use the platform, even if bosses prefer their staff to use official messaging channels, VoxSmart CEO Oliver Blower said. The app has become the ""default messaging service"" in many markets, especially in continental Europe and Asia-Pacific, Blower added. From some 2,000 interdealer users sending 10,000 messages a day in the energy market in 2016, VoxSmart today tracks between three and five million messages weekly across asset classes, including between banks and buy-side clients. ""What's interesting is both the volume and the content of the messages. It's not just, what time are you headed to 'The Dog and Duck', it's, what's your price on a 5-year?,"" said Blower, using slang for a British pub. WHATSAPP TO TELEGRAM Still, the prevalence of messenger services beyond WhatsApp meant Monday's outage was a nuisance rather than a major disruption. In India, for example, market chatter on WhatsApp has moved to Telegram where there are fewer restrictions on the size of group chats. The outage also came after markets had closed in much of Asia, limiting any impact. In the Middle East, ""crypto OTC trading is predominately on Telegram or WhatsApp, where you ask your OTC brokers for bid and offer, and then you hit it and they'll confirm the transaction,"" said Zachary Cefaratti, CEO of Dubai investment platform Dalma Capital, adding that Telegram was becoming more widely used. OTC traders in oil markets were also hit, though again the blow was softened by the use of other platforms. In Russia, oil traders said WhatsApp was commonly used to communicate details on orders across Europe and Asia. Monday's outage was an ""unpleasant surprise"", one Europe-based trader said. ""It was not nice. Everybody uses it. But we use alternative messengers too, so switched,"" said another.

technology,Brokerage Robinhood introduces 24/7 phone support after communications criticisms," NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc The fast-growing broker shot to prominence earlier this year during the ""meme"" stock trading frenzy with its easy-to-use interface that made it a hit among young investors, but users have long complained about a lack of response to inquiries. Robinhood said expanding its customer support would help its  users feel confident, informed and secure about investing, especially when getting started in trading assets like cryptocurrencies. ""We need to help everyone feel like they are ready to become investors, that they belong, and that they will get the support they need in the moments they need it most,"" Christine Brown, chief operating officer of Robinhood Crypto, said in an interview. Robinhood came under intense criticism in June 2020 after a 20-year-old investor named Kearns' family sued Robinhood over the brokerage's ""misleading communications"" that caused their son to panic over what he wrongly believed were huge market losses. The case was settled earlier this year, Robinhood said in a Prior to the launch of 24/7 phone support, which has been rolled out in recent weeks and is a first for a major cryptocurrency trading platform, Robinhood's 21.3 million active users mainly had to correspond with the company through email, Brown said.

For instance, Twitch and Alphabet Inc's ""The vehicle we've built is a production studio on your phone,"" Falon Fatemi, Fireside co-founder, said in an interview. Content creators will be able to start interactive shows from their phone using the Fireside app, which will record and transcribe the show automatically. Fireside also lets users stream their show automatically to other platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitch, which helps streamline an otherwise complicated process if creators want to distribute their content in several places, Fatemi said. Creators can also earn money from their shows by selling tickets for virtual entry or inserting ad breaks. Being able to hear how listeners are responding to the show in real-time can help creators improve their content, Fatemi said. ""Quality content is king. ...

technology,"Ouster will buy Sense Photonics, drive for more automotive deals"," DETROIT, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Lidar developer Ouster Inc Ouster said it will buy privately held Sense for 9.5 million Ouster shares, which had a value of about $68 million as of Monday's close. The acquisition comes as investors have reined in their enthusiasm for lidar startups. Automakers and autonomous driving companies have delayed high-volume deployment of the sensors to the middle of this decade, and Tesla Inc Ouster's share price is down 47% for the year to date. Rival Luminar Technologies Lidar sensors build a detailed picture of a vehicle's surroundings using laser light. Tesla aside, most automakers and autonomous vehicle developers are using lidar as part of the sensor arrays in their automated driving systems. Ouster CEO Angus Pacala told Reuters acquiring Sense Photonics will accelerate by a year Ouster's effort to land high-volume contracts with auto manufacturers. Sense brings solid-state lidar technology, engineers and prospects for contracts to supply sensors to five automakers by 2025-26, Pacala said. ""We can provide a five-lidar system for $1,000 that goes around the vehicle, vs a single forward-looking lidar that may cost $1,000 to $2,000,"" Pacala said. Ouster will set up an automotive division, augmenting its efforts to land contracts to supply lidars for off-road vehicles and industrial equipment. About 80 Sense employees are expected to join Ouster, and certain Sense executives have agreed to five-year retention deals, Ouster said. Current lidar sensors are too costly for all but the most expensive consumer vehicles. Ouster and rivals are racing to develop lower-cost digital and solid-state lidars, and are targeting models to be launched within about four years.

technology,Russia to seek hefty Facebook fine even after content was deleted," MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday that Facebook Communications regulator Roskomnadzor said Facebook had only partially heeded its calls to take down banned content and had also been slow to do so.

Russia has ramped up pressure on foreign tech companies as it seeks to assert greater control over the internet in the country. Legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin in December 2020 gave Russia the power to fine internet providers based on their turnover if they repeatedly fail to delete content when asked. This is the first time the law has been used for this offence. Facebook and Instagram removed some content after Russia threatened to impose a fine based on Facebook's turnover, Roskomnadzor said, but they should have done so within 24 hours of being notified originally to avoid the penalty. The regulator also said Facebook had not taken down all the content that Moscow wanted removed, with 1,043 items still on Facebook and 973 on Instagram. A court will determine the size of the Facebook fine and a date for the hearing will be set in due course, Roskomnadzor said. Experts cited by the Vedomosti newspaper estimate Facebook's annual Russian turnover at between 12 and 39 billion roubles ($165-$538 million). Reuters could not independently verify those figures. Facebook's violations included failing to remove posts promoting drug abuse and dangerous pastimes, information about homemade weapons and explosives, as well as ones by extremist or terrorist organisations, Roskomnadzor said. Earlier this year, the regulator told Facebook and other social media companies to remove posts containing what it said were calls for minors to participate in anti-government protests after the arrest of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. The Russian authorities have since labelled Navalny's political movement as extremist. Roskomnadzor has already filed 20 cases against Facebook this year and imposed smaller fines totalling around 70 million roubles.

technology,"IMF chief says Europe can avoid debt crisis, hard to think of Bitcoin as money"," WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Medium-term fiscal consolidation and growth will put Europe on a sound footing to avoid another sovereign debt crisis despite rising debt levels caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, speaking remotely to an event hosted by Bocconi University in Italy, said she regards digital currencies backed by central banks to be the most reliable form of digital money and that it is difficult to think of Bitcoin and other crypto assets as money. Georgieva said that Europe was more fit to avoid another debt crisis such as the one faced by Greece in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007??8. But she said countries would have to plan carefully how to shift course to medium-term fiscal consolidation to erase the increased pandemic-related debt burden. Georgieva said that 110 countries among the IMF membership are at some stage of looking into central bank digital currencies, and a key challenge was how to guarantee interoperability of digital currencies. ""De-facto assets"" like Bitcoin are not backed by assets that hold their value stable and can rise and fall sharply, Georgieva said, adding: ""In the history of money, it is difficult to think of them as money."" She said the top consideration for policymakers exploring  digital currencies is whether they can be a means of exchange that the public can trust. Other considerations are whether the digital currencies contribute to domestic economic stability and how they fit into international regulatory frameworks, such as those being developed by the Bank for International Settlements. It is ""very impressive how much the international community, the central banks, institutions like ours are now actively engaged to make sure that in this fast moving world of digitalization, money is a source of confidence and helps the economy function rather than (being) a risk.""

technology,Tesla ordered to pay over $130 mln to Black former worker over racism -WSJ," Oct 4 (Reuters) - A federal jury on Monday has ordered Tesla Inc The jury determined that the company failed to take reasonable steps to prevent Owen Diaz, a contract worker who was employed as an elevator operator at Tesla's Fremont factory in 2015 and 2016, from being racially harassed, the newspaper said. In a message to employees that Tesla posted on its website, the automaker noted the trial concerned racial slurs heard on the factory floor and racist graffiti in the bathrooms. It also said the three times that Diaz complained about harassment, Tesla stepped in and made sure action was taken by staffing agencies. The jury awarded Diaz $6.9 million in compensatory damages and $130 million in punitive damages, according to the newspaper. ""While we strongly believe that these facts don't justify the verdict reached by the jury in San Francisco, we do recognize that in 2015 and 2016 we were not perfect,"" Tesla said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters query asking if it would be appealing the verdict. Diaz's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the trial began, presiding judge William Orrick rejected efforts by Tesla to exclude one juror from the jury, saying he believed the attempt was based on race and ""purposefully discriminatory."" Tesla said in its blog post that since Diaz worked at the Fremont factory it had made changes including the establishment of teams dedicated to investigating employee complaints and to ensuring employees had equal opportunities at the company.

technology,Russia says Facebook outage shows why it needs internet sovereignty," MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Russian social networks reported a spike in activity during Monday's global Facebook Russia has sought for years to assert greater sovereignty over its internet segment, putting pressure on foreign tech firms to delete content and store data in Russia. It has also improved its ability to block platforms that break its rules. Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said during the near six-hour outage of Facebook services on Monday evening that this ""answers the question of whether we need our own social networks and internet platforms"". Facebook blamed its outage, which kept its 3.5 billion users from accessing services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, on a faulty configuration change. Russia's largest home-grown social network, Vkontakte, has far more daily users in the country than Facebook and reported a spike in messages and users after Facebook's services dropped.

technology,Chipmaker Infineon plans 50% investment boost," BERLIN, Oct 5 (Reuters) - German chipmaker Infineon Technologies Infineon said it would invest around 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in 2022, up from about 1.6 billion euros this year. ""We are initially investing in existing plants,"" finance chief Sven Schneider told Reuters. He said Infineon was considering whether it needed to add more capacity, but added it was too early to decide on that yet. The leading supplier of chips to the auto industry forecast revenue would grow by a mid-teens percentage next year, with a segment result margin - a measure of operational profitability - of around 20%, up from a 2021 target for 18%. ""The main part of the sales growth will come from capacity building, but also a decent part from higher prices, some of which we will pass on to customers,"" Schneider said. Infineon shares were up 3% at 1317 GMT. The company has blamed a lack of investment in new capacity by its manufacturing partners for tightness in semiconductor markets as demand rebounded after coronavirus lockdowns, disrupting chip supplies especially in the car industry. Contract chipmakers have invested chiefly in production of higher-margin processors used in devices like smartphones, leaving existing plants unable to meet demand for the older chips used in cars. Infineon opened a 1.6 billion euro plant in Austria last month, boosting its ability to supply power chips for cars, data centres and renewable power. The Munich-based firm could decide to build another factory soon, assuming the rapid adoption of electric vehicles continues to take up capacity in its existing plants, Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner predicted. Schneider said he expected the shortage of chips to drag on well in to 2022, welcoming European efforts to increase semiconductor production capacity. Infineon confirmed guidance for 2021 revenues of 11 billion euros. The company has itself faced problems meeting delivery commitments after a winter storm knocked out a plant in the United States and lockdowns disrupted operations in Malaysia.

technology,NFT sales surge to $10.7 bln in Q3 as crypto asset frenzy hits new highs," LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sales volumes of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) surged to $10.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up more than eightfold from the previous quarter, according to data from market tracker DappRadar, as the frenzy for crypto assets reached new highs. NFTs use blockchain to record the ownership of digital items such as images, videos, collectibles and even land in virtual worlds. Surging sales and hefty prices on NFTs - items which do not physically exist - have baffled many but the explosive growth shows no sign of abating. The third-quarter figure was up from $1.3 billion in Q2 and $1.2 billion in Q1, DappRadar said. On the biggest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, sales volumes hit $3.4 billion in August. Activity remained strong even in September when global stock markets faltered. Cryptocurrency price gains during the COVID-19 pandemic are often cited as a driver behind the NFT market's growth -- because people use cryptocurrencies to buy NFTs -- but enthusiasts say that the crypto assets have value independently of market conditions. To be sure, estimates for the size of the NFT market vary depending on what is included. Transactions which take place ""off-chain"", such as NFT art sales at auction houses, are often not captured by the data. DappRadar's numbers, which include multiple blockchains and ""off-chain"" transactions, put total 2021 sales volume at $13.2 billion. Another market tracker, CryptoSlam, which excludes ""off-chain"" sales, says the figure is $9.6 billion. Meanwhile, NonFungible.com, which tracks NFTs on the ethereum blockchain only, puts the 2021 total volume at $7 billion. The most expensive known NFT sale was a digital collage sold at Christie's for $69.3 million in March. Since then, no known NFT has come close to this price, but auction houses still hold NFT sales, often fetching millions. However, despite growing sales and celebrities and other investors jumping on the trend, the number of NFT buyers remains relatively small: there were just 265,927 active wallets trading NFTs on the ethereum blockchain in Q3, NonFungible.com said. More than half of NFTs sold in Q3 were $101-$1,000, while those in the $1,001-$10,000 bracket accounted for 20% of sales, and 17% fetched less than $100, NonFungible.com said. One NFT brand to see particularly high growth in Q3 was Art Blocks, a U.S.-based project which sells NFTs of algorithmically-generated digital artworks. On Saturday, an Art Blocks NFT sold for 2,100 ether (around $6.9 million at the time). Average Art Blocks prices have risen to roughly $15,100 per NFT in September, up from $3,300 in July, according to CryptoSlam. Gaming-related NFTs also surged, with the blockchain-based game Axie Infinity leading the ""play-to-earn"" sector with $776 million in Q3 revenues, DappRadar said.

technology,Robots give Greece's postal service speed boost," ATHENS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - There's a new addition to Greece's postal service: a fleet of yellow robots sorting through the mail. Fifty-five small, four-wheeled autonomous mobile robots -- or AMR's -- powered by artificial intelligence, glide around Hellenic Post's sorting centre in Athens, speeding up an often arduous process. They scan the postal code, weigh the package and, directed by sensors, empty it into the corresponding mail sacks set up around a platform. The robots are part of the state-owned company's digital restructuring programme, which aims to tackle growing numbers of parcels from online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Until recently, sorting has been carried out by manual labour with a high demand in time, often with errors occurring, causing delivery delays for our customers and increased costs for the company,"" Hellenic Post Chief Executive George Constantopoulos told Reuters. Up to 80% of parcel sorting has been handed over to the robots and Constantopoulos said the process was up to three times faster, ensuring next-day delivery. The robots can handle as many as 168,000 parcels weighing up to 15 kg a day and only need to be recharged every four hours for 5 minutes.

""The current U.S. battery capacity is far short of meeting demand. Building a factory to meet demand requires a lead time of 30 months, and I see a battery shortage continuing at least until 2025,"" Kim said, referring to the time needed to supply battery cells domestically, including factory site selection, construction and product testing. In contrast, China is expected to have a battery oversupply, and Europe's supply will be in line with demand, he said. Ford and SK On plan to invest $4.45 billion each to build three new factories in the United States, with production slated to begin in 2025. With the deal for the plants, which will be the biggest in the United States, SK said it has an industry-leading order backlog of 1,600 gigawatt hours, enough for 27 million vehicles. SK Innovation spun off its battery business into its wholly-owned unit, SK On, as of Oct. 1. Kim said Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley told him that Ford's electrification destiny is ""in your hands.""

""It is crucial to recruit external talents as well as nurturing our own talent."" This was echoed by its two big domestic rivals, with SK On describing the sector's expansion as ""exponential"". Indeed the global battery sector has doubled in size over the past five years and South Korea is short of almost 3,000 graduate degree-level positions in areas such as research and design, according to the most recent data from the Korea Battery Industry Association, from late 2020. LGES, SK On and Samsung SDI currently have a total of about 19,000 employees. The Korean crunch reflects a growing talent shortage across a wider global battery market that, according to IHS Markit forecasters, will triple in size to almost $90 billion by 2025. The EU's European Battery Alliance planning group, for example, says ""re-/up-skilling"" is needed in the bloc because its battery industry needs 800,000 new workers by 2025. If the global skills gap is not plugged, some industry experts say it could slow the pace of advances in batteries, which are being counted on to clean up road transport, one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Talent demand in the battery industry outweighs supply, and battery makers are anxious to ensure that they have got this small group of people who can work on this technology, and won't be left behind in the fast-growing market,"" said Samsung Securities analyst Cho Hyun-ryul. 'COMPETITIVE PACKAGES' In a sign of the skills pressure, LGES - South Korea's No.1 battery maker by volume - plans to launch a new ""battery-smart factory department"" at the prestigious Korea University next spring with guaranteed jobs for graduates. More immediately, executives have been flying to the United States to lead recruiting events at schools there. The LGES CEO and his managers went to Los Angeles last month while the SK Innovation CEO and staff hosted an event in San Francisco on Saturday. These companies are not only competing with other established Asian players, including market leader CATL The talent shortage in South Korea is being compounded by some existing employees moving to foreign competitors that had offered better pay, according to two industry sources with knowledge of the matter. They declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Northvolt, which counts Volkswagen as a client, has previously said that some of its employees were recruited from top battery makers, including LGES and Panasonic. ""We do have few people working for Northvolt that are from South Korea, which is obviously a very impressive country when it comes to battery manufacturing and development with several well-respected companies active in this space,"" a spokesperson for the company told Reuters last week. ""We try to offer competitive packages to our employees ??everyone working here is a shareholder in the company for instance,"" he added, though did not specify pay details. Battery specialists in South Korea newly graduated with doctorate degrees can earn as much as 100 million won ($85,000) a year, and those without that level of qualification average about 80 million won after gaining a few years of experience, according to two sources at major South Korean battery firms.

""We need a strong, diversified and resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain,"" he added. Even in the face of the growing skills gap, the worldwide demand for their products has supercharged the battery makers' expansion plans. LGES expects its production capacity to reach 155 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of batteries by the end of this year and plans to raise that to 430 GWh in 2025 that could power about 7.2 million EVs. SK Innovation aims to boost its annual production capacity more than five-fold to 220 GWh by 2025 and last week announced the plan to invest 10.2 trillion won with Ford to Richard Kim, principal analyst at IHS Markit, said the skills gap was likely to be a problem for years to come.

The U.S. Defense Department awarded the sole-source cloud computing procurement contract to Microsoft Corp Oracle wanted the justices to hear the appeal despite the fact that the JEDI contract had been canceled because it said the flaws in that contract could recur as the government screens bidders for a new one. The now-canceled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract was part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon aimed at making it more technologically agile. Oracle sued in 2018 to protest the structure of the procurement and certain Pentagon employees' conflicts of interest involving Amazon, which ultimately lost the JEDI award to Microsoft. The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals involving government contracts, ruled against Oracle last year, saying that the company would not have had a substantial chance of securing the contract.

Qualcomm's bid came after it signed a collaboration deal with Veoneer to develop a software and chip platform for driver-assistance systems called Arriver in January 2021. Qualcomm and SWW Partners, a newly-founded investment firm based in New York, will buy Veoneer for $37 per share in cash, Veoneer's statement said. The unusual deal structure allows SSW Partners to buy all outstanding shares of Veoneer, after which it will lead a process to look for a strategic buyer for Veoneer's Tier-1 supplier businesses, including the restraint control systems (RCS) and active safety businesses, while selling the Arriver business to Qualcomm.

Inflows to the sector were $90.2 million last week, led by bitcoin which snagged $69 million, according to CoinShares data as of Oct. 1. Over the past seven weeks, crypto inflows reached $390 million. For 2021, inflows totaled $6.1 billion. Bitcoin recorded its third straight week of inflows. ""We believe this decisive turnaround in sentiment is due to growing confidence in the asset class amongst investors and more accommodative statements from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve,"" wrote James Butterfill, investment strategist, at CoinShares. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler last week at a Financial Times conference reiterated his support for bitcoin exchange traded funds that would invest in futures contracts instead of the digital currency itself. A day later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in remarks before Congress, said the Fed had no intention of banning cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin on Monday hit a four-week high of just under $50,000  and was last up 2.3% at $49,333.

technology,Analysis: Zoom's abandoned Five9 deal shows hurdles to expansion," Oct 4 (Reuters) - Zoom Video Communications Inc's Zoom's unwillingness to add cash to its bid and rely solely on its stock as currency to pay for the Five9 deal backfired after its shares slipped by as much as 29% in the weeks after the deal was announced in July, on concerns that the return to physical meetings as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes will erode its business. Five9 shareholders voted down the deal last week. Investment bankers and analysts said Zoom's stock would likely remain volatile until investors establish what the prospects of its business will be once the pandemic is over. This decreases the chances of another acquisition target accepting Zoom's shares as currency in the near term, they said. Zoom carries almost no debt but it had only $2 billion in cash as of the end of July, which it needs to fund growth initiatives. ""Zoom has to figure out how to keep some of the customers that signed up as individual subscribers that may not need Zoom when they return to more physical lives,"" said Alex Zukin, an analyst at Wolfe Research. Zoom declined to comment. Another hurdle that could give the next company that will attract Zoom's acquisition interest pause is its ties to China. U.S. prosecutors charged a former China-based Zoom executive last year with disrupting video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown at the request of the Chinese government. A U.S. Justice Department-led committee said last month it was reviewing Zoom's proposed acquisition of Five9 to see if it ""poses a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests."" While Five9 shareholders voted down the Zoom deal before that review concluded, analysts said the regulatory intervention exposed a risk that will continue to weigh on the minds of other acquisition targets. ""The U.S. government is likely to give increased scrutiny to transactions involving companies with engineering talent or other operations in China,"" said Sujit Raman, a former U.S. Associate Deputy Attorney General who is now partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP specializing in government investigations. ACTIVIST HEDGE FUNDS Zoom sought to acquire Five9, whose call center software is used by more than 2,000 companies across the globe to interact with their clients, offering more products beyond its flagship teleconferencing. Without any transformative acquisition, Zoom shareholders are likely to grow anxious over the company's reliance on virtual meetings, whose popularity has peaked, some investors said. Dianne McKeever, chief investment officer of investment firm Ides Capital Management said it was possible that an activist hedge fund would seek to take advantage of the situation by amassing a stake in Zoom and push for changes. ""When a deal falls apart, forced selling by often short-term focused, event driven funds can create an outsized valuation opportunity for a long-term investor,"" McKeever said. Examples of companies that attracted the wrath of investors after botching an acquisition attempt abound. Hedge fund TCI Fund Management, one of the biggest investors in Canadian National Railway Co Activist hedge funds Starboard Value LP and Elliott Management Corp have amassed stakes in Willis Towers Watson Plc To be sure, Zoom's stock may be expensive for some activist hedge funds, analysts said. It is also not obvious whether there would be an acquirer for Zoom, which is something some activist hedge funds might push for. Still, a failed deal can be interpreted by some investors as a signal by a company's board that it cannot unlock more value, said Lawrence Elbaum, co-head of law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP's shareholder activism practice. ""This immediately makes their board seats vulnerable in an activism campaign,"" Elbaum said.

technology,Factbox: Electric-vehicle batteries: major players and their expansion plans," SEOUL, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The global auto industry's shift to electric vehicles (EVs) has spurred an expansion race among battery makers, and caused a growing a skills shortage. See main story: Global sales of EVs, estimated at 2.5 million vehicles in 2020, is forecast to grow more than 12-fold to 31.1 million by 2030 and account for nearly a third of new vehicle sales, according to consulting firm Deloitte. Here are major players' expansion plans in key EV markets of China, the United States and Europe. CATL As of end-June, the Chinese company has annual battery production capacity of 65.45 Gigawatt hours (GWh), and has an additional 92.5 GWh of capacity under construction. The global industry leader by The company announced a plan in August to set up a production base in Shanghai, a move that will put it close to Tesla Inc's LG ENERGY SOLUTION (LGES) The South Korean leader expects its production capacity to reach 155 GWh by the end of this year and plans to raise that to 430 GWh by 2025 - which could power about 7.2 million EVs. It plans to invest more than $4.5 billion in its U.S. battery production business through 2025. The plans include two new plants, jointly built with GM in Ohio and Tennessee, which would allow LGES to manufacture a total of 70 GWh of batteries in the United States by 2024. LGES already has a factory in Michigan with annual production capacity of 5 GWh. In China, where the company makes cylindrical battery cells for Tesla It has invested about 6.8 trillion won in Poland since 2016 to secure an annual production capacity of 70 GWh and plans to make another 2.5 trillion won investment. In July, LGES and Hyundai Motor Group said they would invest $1.1 billion to jointly set up a EV battery cell plant in Indonesia. PANASONIC The Japanese company manufacturers cylindrical NMA (Nickel-Manganese-Aluminum) batteries in the United States at a plant in Nevada and in facilities in Japan. Nearly all goes to Tesla. It does not disclose its manufacturing capacity, but in May said it was aiming to expand the 35 GWh Nevada facility because of increased demand from Tesla. The Nevada plant, built at a cost of $1.6 billion, was opened in 2014. Panasonic plans to begin a test line in Japan this year to make a new cylindrical battery designed by Tesla to halve battery costs. It also has a joint venture with Toyota Motor The company has said it is considering building an auto battery plant in Norway to expand into Europe, but has yet to give details. SK ON SK On has a combined global annual production capacity of 40 GWh -  27 GWh in China, 7.5 GWh in Hungary and the rest from South Korea. It plans to boost that more than five-fold to 220 GWh by 2025, with the expansion primarily focused on the U.S. market. SK On is building two EV battery plants in Georgia with a combined annual production capacity of 21.5 GWh that will begin production from early 2022.

The company added it appears the FTC ""had no basis for its naked allegation that Facebook has or had a monopoly."" The social media giant asked that the lawsuit be dismissed with prejudice, which would make it harder for the agency to amend the lawsuit. The FTC declined to comment. Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in June that the FTC's original complaint filed in December failed to provide evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in the social-networking market. The FTC's amended complaint, filed in August, added more detail on its accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and again asked Boasberg to order the sale of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC argued at length in its revised complaint that Facebook dominates the U.S. personal social networking market with more than 65% of monthly active users since 2012. Facebook filing said the FTC's complaint was ""at odds with the commercial reality of intense competition with surging rivals like TikTok and scores of other attractive options for consumers."" The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines in August to file the amended lawsuit and denied Facebook's request that agency chair Lina Khan be recused. In its motion, Facebook argued that the FTC vote to file the amended complaint was not valid because Khan participated. It included a long series of statements from Khan, made before she became chair of the FTC, which were critical of the social media giant. In a series of tweets from December 2020, she praises lawsuits brought by the FTC and state attorneys general saying ""hopeful that it marks yet another step forward in the growing efforts to rehabilitate antitrust laws."" Facebook also notes that the FTC is suing to undo mergers that it had approved: Instagram, which it bought in 2012 for $1 billion, and WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014 for $19 billion. ""The FTC challenges acquisitions that the agency cleared after its own contemporaneous review...,"" the motion said. ""The case is entirely without legal or factual support. This is as true now as it was before."" Facebook also included a dissent from FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, who had voted to oppose filing the amended lawsuit because the FTC had raised no objections to the Instagram and WhatsApp deals. ""The FTC's fictional market ignores the competitive reality: Facebook competes vigorously with TikTok, iMessage, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, YouTube, and countless others to help people share, connect, communicate or simply be entertained,"" a Facebook spokesperson said.

technology,Exxon exodus turns floating 'cube' into Internet meme," HOUSTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's trophy U.S. campus is becoming an Internet meme. The visually stunning complex, sometimes compared to Apple's ring and Alphabet's Googleplex campuses, opened in 2014 as Exxon stood atop of the global oil market. Its centerpiece is a giant cube that appears to float above the office and research facility. The cube has become the emblem for a wrenching staff exodus and Exxon's financial fall. Hundreds of departing employees this year have posted images on social media of them standing in front of it on their last day of work, and versions have spread among Exxon facilities worldwide. A historic, $22.4 billion loss last year fueled the departures of thousands of employees. Cost-cutting will pare 14,000 jobs by year-end, and this year's job review has led to voluntary and forced departures - accompanied by the social media postings of the cube. ""You should scan social media and find all the people who are excited to be joining ExxonMobil,"" Exxon spokeperson Casey Norton told Reuters. Restructuring cuts finished last December and any positions opened this year due to performance-related dismissals may be refilled, he said. Auld Lang Syne ""That picture will always remind me of the positive experiences I had,"" said former Exxon finance supervisor Jason Crawford, who posted his own three weeks ago. He resigned after concluding that top management was ill-prepared for challenges ahead and Exxon's ""days of being a global leader are long behind them."" The cube was designed to showcase Exxon's engineering and technology prowess. A feat of engineering, it looms over the 385-acre campus, floating over an open courtyard and reflecting pools. Officially called Exxon Energy Center, it opened in 2014 at a time the firm was atop the global oil and gas market. Oil was selling for $100 a barrel and Exxon's market value, now about $258 billion, approached half a trillion dollars. The building initially provided a symbol of Exxon's high-tech ambitions for itself and a lure for talented engineers then flocking to high-tech companies. The campus has walking paths that wend through the area, restaurants, a gym with trainers, and physical science laboratories. HIGH-TECH LURE Avery Smith, who posted his photo in front of the cube earlier this year, was one of those drawn to the complex. The 26-year-old data scientist worked at Exxon Mobil Research & Engineering and left last January to start Snow Data Science. Exxon's ""rigid culture"" limited the projects he wanted to pursue and its pandemic work-from-home restrictions grated on him. ""I was a little trapped in my position and wanted to do bigger projects,"" Smith said, choosing to launch his own  enterprise. The cube represents the company at its best, said Smith and others who posted their cube portraits. ""I was challenged to work with people all over the world,"" wrote engineer Margaret Webb, with assignments ""tackling some of the largest problems in the world today."" Although she left Exxon in February ""before this trend became popular,"" Webb recently felt compelled to add hers after seeing hundreds materialize from colleagues. ""The biggest thing I take away is this - something needs to be done about how engineers consider the ethical, social and environmental impacts of their daily work,"" she wrote. A LEGO REPLICA Cube references now appear in goodbyes far from Texas. An Exxon scientist in Calgary, Alberta, built a Cube replica from Legos for his goodbye image. A Buenos Aires, Argentina, finance supervisor drew on a photo from a prior visit for his. ""I don't have the customary energy cube picture,"" lamented Krishnan Kumaran, 55, who last month took early retirement after 18 years at the company. His goodbye included ""a picture of the (Exxon) building located in pastoral Clinton, New Jersey,"" where he worked as a computational scientist.

technology,Binance trading volumes soar despite regulatory crackdown," LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Trading volumes at major cryptocurrency exchange Binance soared between July and September, suggesting a recent crackdown by regulators across the globe has had little impact on the platform's business. Worried about consumer protection as well as the standard of anti-money laundering checks at crypto exchanges, regulators from Britain and Germany to Hong Kong and Japan have in recent months ratcheted up pressure on Binance. Some have banned the platform from certain activities, while others have warned consumers it was not licensed to operate in their jurisdiction. Binance has in response tightened anti-money laundering checks and cut its product line-up. Yet Binance's spot cryptocurrency trading volumes totalled $789 billion in September versus $454 billion in July, data from UK researcher CryptoCompare compiled for Reuters showed, with Binance cementing its status as the world's biggest digital asset platform. Derivatives volumes jumped almost 25% to $1.7 trillion, the data showed. A Binance spokesperson declined to comment. The growth in volumes mirrored that across other major crypto platforms including San Francisco-based Coinbase Global Inc Singapore's regulator last month became the latest from a major financial centre to target Binance, warning it could be in breach of local laws and should stop providing payment services to the city-state's residents. The move prompted Binance to stop users in Singapore from buying and trading cryptocurrencies on its main platform, the latest in a string of moves by the platform to dial back its range of crypto products that could be overseen by regulators. Binance in July started to wind down its derivatives business across Europe, and also restricted derivatives trading by Hong Kong users. It also ditched its offerings of digital tokens linked to stocks. Binance in August said it would demand stricter background checks on customers to bolster efforts against money laundering.

technology,"Made-from-CO2 concrete, lululemons and diamonds spark investor excitement"," Oct 4 (Reuters) - What do diamonds, sunglasses, high-end lululemon sportswear and concrete have to do with climate change? They can all be made using carbon dioxide (CO2), locking up the planet warming gas. And tech startups behind these transformations are grabbing investor attention. Some use bacteria. Some use proteins. Some use chemical processes to speed natural reactions. Most pull apart the carbon and the oxygen in CO2 to create another chemical that is used to make consumers goods. Companies in the area raised over $800 million so far this year, more than tripling from 2020, according to a Reuters review of data from PitchBook, Circular Carbon Network, Cleantech Group and Climate Tech VC. ""I don't want to call it a green tax, but our consumers who really do care ??have demonstrated that they're willing to pay a bit of a premium,"" said Ryan Shearman, chief executiveof Aether Diamonds, which grows diamonds in the lab using captured CO2.
On the opposite end of the glamour spectrum, the concrete industry, green also is good for marketing, said Robert Niven, CEO of CarbonCure Technologies, which makes technology that injects CO2 into fresh concrete, and strengthens it by locking in the carbon. ""About 90% of our uptake has been from independent concrete producers large and small that are just looking for that competitive edge."" The world needs to capture and store 10 billion tonnes of CO2 annually by midcentury to slow climate change, according to United Nations estimates, a scale the companies can only dream of, when current carbon capture pilots often are at scales of hundreds and thousands of tonnes. Humans produce greenhouse gases that are the equivalent of around 50 billion tonnes of CO2 each year, and governments will gather in Scotland in late October and November for a U.N. climate conference on cutting emissions. All fossil-based products that could use recycled CO2 instead account for some 6.8 billion tonnes of emissions, according to a Nicholas Flanders, co-founder of Twelve, which uses chemical processes to reuse CO2, says recycling is better than storing captured CO2 underground. ""We're developing a technology that can go toe to toe with fossil fuels"" without additional financial incentives to remove carbon. That is because many consumers are attracted by ""green"" labels. lululemon athletica inc CEO Jennifer Holmgren said LanzaTech's ethanol is more expensive than corn based ethanol, but customers looking to source greener products are buying. The biggest investment in the space this year, more than $350 million, was into Houston-based Solugen, which feeds CO2 and other ingredients to enzymes that make chemicals for stronger cement, water pipe coating and other products. Its products are already cheaper than those made from fossil fuels, said CEO Gaurab Chakrabarti. Still, it is not sourcing CO2 captured from factory emissions or from the air, which Chakrabarti described as ?�an option.??Capturing CO2 is a less enticing prospect for many investors, who think the government should fund such expensive, high risk projects. However, Nicholas Moore Eisenberger, managing partner at Pure Energy Partners, has invested in direct air capture firm Global Thermostat and sees opportunity in necessity and believes once the projects scale up, they will be cheaper. ""The science tells us that we have under a decade to start to bend the curve on climate, and that is now within the investment time frame of most venture and private equity investors,"" said Eisenberger.

technology,'Consumers aren't stupid': Google lawyer rejects EU market abuse ruling," LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Billions of people use Google because it's the best, not because of deals the company made to stay competitive, Google's lawyer said on Friday, wrapping up a week of testimony as the U.S. tech giant fights a record $5 billion antitrust fine. The European Commission hit Alphabet's At issue are deals requiring phone makers to pre-install the Google Search app and the Chrome browser app together with Google Play, as well deals blocking some variants of Android. ""The reason why billions of people choose Google as their search tool every day is not because of an abuse of dominance. It's because it's the best,"" lawyer Meredith Pickford told the EU's General Court, the bloc's second highest. Pickford said the deals were far from being anti-competitive tools, rather they were to ensure Google stayed competitive. ""You can still compete hard and compete on the merits. Consumers aren't stupid. If Bing or another search engine were better than Google, people would turn to it,"" he said, referring to a rival Microsoft Corp ""Successful companies don't stay successful by resting on their laurels and failing to compete,"" Pickford told the court. The European Commission's lawyer, Nicholas Khan, said the deals showed that Google had stacked the odds in its favour and urged judges to uphold the Commission's decision and fine. ""Google gives itself the laurel wreath even before the race has started,"" Khan said. ""The scale of the practices entirely justify the fine that was imposed.""

When we figured out cars were safer with seatbelts, the government took action,"" said Haugen's written testimony to be delivered to a Senate Commerce subcommittee. ""I implore you to do the same here."" Haugen will tell the panel that Facebook executives regularly chose profits over user safety. ""The company's leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer and won't make the necessary changes because they have put their immense profits before people. Congressional action is needed,"" she will say. ""As long as Facebook is operating in the dark, it is accountable to no one. And it will continue to make choices that go against the common good."" Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is on the subcommittee, said that she would ask Haugen about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. ""I am also particularly interested in hearing from her about whether she thinks Facebook did enough to warn law enforcement and the public about January 6th and whether Facebook removed election misinformation safeguards because it was costing the company financially,"" Klobuchar said in an emailed comment. The senator also said that she wanted to discuss Facebook's algorithms, and whether they ""promote harmful and divisive content."" Haugen, who worked as a product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, was the whistleblower who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls. Facebook owns Instagram as well as WhatsApp. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Haugen added that ""Facebook's closed design means it has no oversight ??even from its own Oversight Board, which is as blind as the public."" That makes it impossible for regulators to serve as a check, she added. ""This inability to see into the actual systems of Facebook and confirm that Facebook?�s systems work like they say is like the Department of Transportation regulating cars by watching them drive down the highway,"" her testimony says. ""Imagine if no regulator could ride in a car, pump up its wheels, crash test a car, or even know that seat belts could exist."" The Journal's stories, based on Facebook internal presentations and emails, showed the company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm; failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy; and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls. Haugen said Facebook had done too little to prevent its platform from being used by people planning violence. ""The result has been a system that amplifies division, extremism, and polarization ??and undermining societies around the world. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people,"" she said.

Three sources with knowledge of the deal told Reuters that Grab had purchased the stakes of Indonesian conglomerate Lippo, which launched OVO, and e-commerce platform Tokopedia. Sinagpore-based Grab's stake will expand from 39% currently, according to a regulatory filing submitted to Indonesian authorities, in what is the first phase of its restructuring. ""We welcome a greater commitment from Grab in OVO. We're working in close consultation with the regulators to complete the ownership restructuring process,"" OVO said in a statement.

Regulators globally have voiced concerns that the rise in privately operated currencies could undermine their control of their financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks and hurt investors.

technology,HelbizCoin cryptocurrency lawsuit is revived," NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday revived a lawsuit by investors who claimed they were defrauded into buying the HelbizCoin cryptocurrency as part of a ""pump and dump"" scheme. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court judge erred in finding he lacked jurisdiction to review Helbiz Inc's $38.6 million initial coin offering because its coins were not listed on a U.S. exchange or bought domestically. While not addressing the lawsuit's merits, the 3-0 decision could be a setback for cryptocurrency firms seeking to avoid liability in U.S. courts by claiming they operated and raised money in foreign countries. Investors said Helbiz promised to use proceeds from its 2018 offering to develop a smartphone-based transportation rental platform allowing users to rent bikes, cars, scooters and flying drone taxis. The investors said Helbiz instead kept most of the money for itself, and for almost every rental accepted U.S. dollars, euros and other payment methods, dooming HelbizCoin. U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit in January, citing a 2010 Supreme Court precedent that limited the extraterritorial reach of federal securities laws. But the Manhattan-based appeals court said Stanton should have used a more ""tailored"" approach, and consider the investors' claims under New York state law and that state's rules for applying its laws extraterritorially. It also said investors could amend their complaint to show that one plaintiff was a Texas citizen who bought HelbizCoin domestically, supporting their federal securities law claims. Robert Heim, a lawyer for Helbiz, said the company believes the lawsuit ""is without any merit whatsoever, and we look forward to a speedy resolution."" Michael Kanovitz, a lawyer for the investors, said his clients plan also to show that title to their coins were transferred in the United States. ""The fraud is there to be proved,"" he said.

While some analysts expected Zoom to raise its offer to address Five9 shareholder worries about the price, others said an almost 30% drop in Zoom shares since July on the back of slowing growth only dampened the prospects. Under the deal terms, Five9 shareholders would have received 0.5533 Zoom share for each share held. The terms then implied a 12.8% premium over Five9's market price. ""The deal was negatively perceived from the beginning given the small premium and all-stock structure,"" Jefferies analyst Samad Samana said in a note to clients. ""ZM's stock declining 28% since the announcement only compounded the issues and likely made revising the terms difficult as well."" The deal - which would have been Zoom's biggest-ever purchase if completed - was also opposed by shareholder proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis. The firms had recommended that Five9 shareholders vote against the deal, citing growth concerns and dual-class shares. ""While we think the deal made strategic sense for both companies over the long term, the variable deal tied to volatile (Zoom) shares was not an economically attractive deal for (Five9) shareholders at this time,"" Piper Sandler analysts said. Analysts at Barclays blamed the fall in Zoom's share price and possible regulatory scrutiny for the deal falling through.

The research, titled ""Social comparison on Instagram,"" surveyed 100,000 people in March and April 2020 in nine countries, including the United States, Australia and Brazil. Facebook spokesperson Kevin McAlister said the survey respondents were not asked to name specific accounts, but researchers found the celebrity accounts were ""some of the most frequently seen accounts for people who told us they experienced either higher or lower levels of negative social comparison on Instagram,"" based on the company's internal data. He noted the findings made sense because the celebrities listed have more than 30 million followers each. Facebook researchers did not study whether users' exposure to those celebrity accounts led to negative feelings about themselves. Singer Ariana Grande and model Kendall Jenner were among the celebrities who followers felt more negative social comparison, Facebook researchers found. Facebook researchers noted in the slide decks that the company could partner with the stars on campaigns to reduce negative comparison. On the other hand, Instagram accounts belonging to ""The Ellen Show,"" which is hosted by comedian Ellen DeGeneres, American actor Will Smith and Brazilian soccer player Neymar had followers who felt ""less negative comparison,"" according to the research slide deck. The findings are notable given that Instagram helped pioneer the rise of social media influencers and made efforts to recruit celebrities to the app in its early days. Actor Ashton Kutcher was one star who helped Instagram gain credibility with other celebrities and helped introduce the company to Grande, according to an anecdote reported in the book ""No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram."" The company's partnerships team also works with celebrities, musicians and other public figures to improve their presence on Instagram, according to the LinkedIn bios of some employees.

technology,"Malaysia's help needed to ease global chip shortage, Taiwan says"," TAIPEI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Malaysia's help is needed to resolve the global shortage of auto semiconductors, especially when it comes to packaging, a sector affected by the country's COVID-19 curbs, Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said. Taiwan, as a major chip producer, has been front and centre of efforts to resolve the shortage, which has idled auto plants around the world. Speaking in an interview late on Thursday at her ministry, Wang told Reuters that Taiwan alone could not sort out the problem because the supply chain is so complex. ""The bottleneck in fact is in Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, because for a while the factories were all shut down,"" she said. The problem was especially acute with auto chip packaging, with companies in Malaysia providing services not offered by Taiwanese firms, Wang added. ""Now the focus is on Malaysia resuming production as soon as possible. I know that Malaysia started to restore production capacity in early September, and now the production capacity has returned to about 80%, so if their capacity can slowly come back, this problem can be slowly dealt with."" Malaysia is home to suppliers and factories serving semiconductor makers such as Europe's STMicroelectronics Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association President Wong Siew Hai said that the major Malaysian semiconductor manufacturers are already running at full capacity to supply the auto industry. ""For the automotive chips, they are doing their best to ship as much as possible, but the current capacity cannot meet demand because it's too huge, the build-up is a lot,"" he said. ""Everything is at 100% to satisfy the demand for automotive parts. Where they can increase productivity, they're already doing so."" Adding capacity will take time, with most available only next year, Wong said. Malaysia accounts for 13% of global chip packaging and testing, and 7% of the world's semiconductor trade passes through the country, with some value added at local factories and chips getting combined with other parts before final shipment. The White House pressed automakers, chip companies and others last month to provide information on the semiconductor crisis.

technology,S.Korea broadband firm sues Netflix after traffic surge from 'Squid Game'," SEOUL, Oct 1 (Reuters) - South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued Netflix The move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should ""reasonably"" give something in return to the internet service provider for network usage, and multiple South Korean lawmakers have spoken out against content providers who do not pay for network usage despite generating explosive traffic. Netflix said it will review SK Broadband's claim, and seek dialogue and explore ways in the meantime to work with SK Broadband to ensure customers are not affected. The popularity of the hit series ""Squid Game"" and other offerings have underscored Netflix's status as the country's second-largest data traffic generator after Google's YouTube, but the two are the only ones to not pay network usage fees, which other content providers such as Amazon, Apple and Facebook are paying, SK said. Netflix's data traffic handled by SK jumped 24 times from May 2018 to 1.2 trillion bits of data processed per second as of September, SK said, riding on the success of several Netflix productions from Korea including ""Squid Game"" and ""D.P."" SK Broadband said it lodged a lawsuit against Netflix for it to pay for using SK's networks since Netflix began using SK's dedicated line starting 2018 to deliver increasingly larger amounts of data-heavy, high-definition video content to viewers in Korea from servers in Japan and Hong Kong. Last year, Netflix had brought its own lawsuit on whether it had any obligation to pay SK for network usage, arguing Netflix's duty ends with creating content and leaving it accessible. It said SK's expenses were incurred while fulfilling its contractual obligations to Internet users, and delivery in the Internet world is ""free of charge as a principle"", according to court documents. But the Seoul Central District Court ruled against Netflix in June, saying that SK is seen as providing ""a service provided at a cost"" and it is ""reasonable"" for Netflix to be ""obligated to provide something in return for the service"". SK estimated the network usage fee Netflix needed to pay was about 27.2 billion won ($22.9 million) in 2020 alone, the court document said. Netflix has appealed against the ruling, court records showed, with fresh proceedings to start in late December. Netflix said in a statement on Wednesday that it contributed to the creation of about 16,000 jobs in South Korea stemming from about 770 billion won in investments, as well as an economic effect of about 5.6 trillion won. Ruling party lawmaker Kim Sang-hee said on Wednesday that out of South Korea's top 10 data traffic generators, 78.5% of the traffic came from foreign content providers, up from 73.1% a year earlier, with ""Google-YouTube and Netflix that account for the majority turning a blind eye to network usage fees"".

technology,Myanmar currency trade turns to online groups on Facebook amid crisis," Oct 1 (Reuters) - As Myanmar's economic slump deepens after February's military coup and parts of its financial system freeze up, many in the strife-torn country are turning to online groups to bypass official channels to trade currencies. The fragility of the financial system was further exposed this week when the The online groups, which run mainly on Facebook, have become a way for buyers and sellers of currencies to connect, often relying on trust when arranging physical exchanges of notes. ""I posted to sell some old notes yesterday in the group,"" said May Lay, a Yangon resident, referring to what she said was the sale of about $190 into kyat on a Facebook group. ""I lost my job and have had no income recently. Life is difficult with a one-year-old child,"" she said, noting how her household spending on food had doubled. In the immediate months after the Feb. 1 coup, long lines of people queued up to withdraw cash from banks, though recently kyat savings have taken an ever bigger hit with the currency losing 60% of its value against the dollar in September. Speaking after the One of the biggest of the groups set up on Facebook called ""Dollar Buyer Seller Direct"" had about 170,000 members, with the group's administrator warning users to be careful before making a deal. ""The seller, the buyer, both take responsibility,"" it warned. The group appears to have been taken down in recent days, though at least one other site has emerged to fill its place. In Myanmar, money traders are supposed to get a licence to operate. Central bank officials did not respond to requests for comment. Asked about such sites using its platform, Rafael Frankel, director of public policy emerging countries, Facebook Asia Pacific, said: ""Our dedicated team, including regional experts, continues to monitor the situation in Myanmar in real time and we will take action on anything that violates our policies as soon as we become aware of it."" ""Our thoughts are with the people of Myanmar at this difficult time,"" Frankel said. Social media users posted images of long queues for fuel in some areas this week, though a source with knowledge of Myanmar's fuel market said this was due to authorities subsidising gasoline at some stations. SMUGGLING DOLLARS With some money changers halting operations and official exchange rates now well out of line with market rates, more people have been drawn to the online sites to do their own deals, which are concluded in person. ""It's like a black market. Both parties have to worry until the deal is done,"" said Ye Yint Tun, 33, who turned to becoming an unofficial currency broker after losing his job as a real estate agent for expatriates. While initially asking for a 20% fee, he has now slashed that to 2% to make it more attractive and reckons he earns about 10,000 to 20,000 kyat per day, or about $4 to just over $8, based on recent rates. ""There are risks that you will be robbed while you doing exchange. So, we have to be very careful."" The online groups also tap into the flows of money remitted by overseas workers in neighbouring countries like Thailand. ""Millions of dollars are being smuggled into Myanmar from Thailand daily,"" an unlicensed money trader based in Thailand said, noting how the roughly four million Myanmar workers in Thailand needed to send money back to family members. ""We use Facebook as our platform for selling money,"" said the trader, who declined to be named. Workers from Myanmar in Thailand pay traders with their Thai baht earnings, who in turn give kyat to family members in Myanmar and use the baht to buy U.S. dollars. Another Thai-based trader described how U.S. dollars were smuggled into Myanmar overland, sometimes hidden in clothes or household items.

technology,"Facebook research shows company knew of Instagram harm to teens, senators say"," Sept 30 (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Thursday grilled Facebook Inc The hearing in front of the Senate consumer protection subcommittee was called after the Wall Street Journal published several stories earlier this month about how Facebook knew Instagram caused some teen girls in particular to feel badly about their self-image. After growing opposition to the project, Facebook put plans for Instagram Kids, aimed at pre-teens, on hold this week. Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, disputed the committee and WSJ's conclusions of the research documents throughout the hearing, and said the company was working to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings. ""This research is a bombshell,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, during the hearing. ""It is powerful, gripping, riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children, and that it has concealed those facts and findings."" ""IG stands for Instagram, but it also stands for Insta-greed,"" said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts. The senators pressed Davis on several major themes, including what identifiable data Facebook collects on users under the age of 13, to what extent the company views young users as a growth area and to confirm whether it knew that Instagram led some children to consider suicide. Davis reiterated that kids under 13 were not allowed on Facebook, adding 0.5% of teens in the company's research connected their ""suicidal ideation"" to Instagram, lower than the figures the Journal had reported. ""You've cherry-picked part of the research that you think helps your spin right now,"" said Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, demanding Facebook commit to releasing its full research on the links between Instagram and youth suicide.

Under the deal terms announced in July, Five9 shareholders would have received 0.5533 Zoom share for every Five9 share. The terms implied a 12.8% premium over Five9's market price and valued the company at $14.7 billion. Since then, Zoom's stock has dropped over 25% as the virtual conferencing giant reported slower growth on its second-quarter earnings call.

The company said it would launch Zoom Video Engagement Center, its cloud-based contact center solution, in early 2022.

technology,Singapore plans central data platform to fight money laundering," SINGAPORE, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank said on Friday it would create a digital platform enabling banks to share information on customers and transactions, part of efforts to prevent money laundering and financing of criminal activity. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement that it plans to launch the platform in the first half of 2023 and make it available to the city-state's six biggest commercial banks in the initial phase. Financial and trade hubs like Singapore are particularly vulnerable to money laundering due to large cross-border flows. ""The information-sharing framework is designed to target serious criminal behaviours and allow financial institutions to more quickly detect the bad actors to purge and deter them,"" Loo Siew Yee, MAS's assistant managing director for policy payments and financial crime, said in a statement. Described by the MAS as the first centralised platform of its kind, the initiative was the result of cooperation between the MAS and DBS The MAS said a common challenge faced by financial institutions was not being able to warn each other about unusual activity in customers' accounts. In 2015, Singapore discovered that funds linked to the scandal-ridden Malaysian state fund 1MDB were laundered through its banking system. The MAS shut down the local units of two Swiss private banks in 2016, froze millions of dollars in bank accounts, charged private bankers and imposed fines on banks. ""Bad actors in financial crimes typically use bank accounts from different banks over a period of time to hide and spend the illicit funds,"" said Loretta Yuen, head of group legal and regulatory compliance at OCBC Bank.

""The fine that was imposed, a staggering 4.34 billion euros, was not appropriate,"" Google's lawyer Genevra Forwood told the five-judge panel of the General Court on the fourth day of a week-long hearing, which is taking place three years after the European Commission sanctioned the company. ""The problem is not the headline-grabbing fine per se. The problem is how the Commission reached that figure,"" she said. Forwood said there was no anti-competitive intent in Google's actions nor could it have known that its conduct was an abuse based on EU case law and there was no precedent for it. ""So it was wrong for the Commission to impose any fine at all, let alone turn up the dials to reach its biggest fine ever,"" Forwood said. She also took issue with the EU competition enforcer adding a 11% gravity factor to Google's fine compared with 5% for Intel ""Even if this Court considers that a fine is appropriate, it would only be proper to turn the dials right down,"" she said. However, the European Commission's lawyer Anthony Dawes said Google ""simply could not be unaware of the anti-competitive behaviour of its practices"". ""Infringements committed negligently are no less serious than those committed intentionally,"" Dawes said, adding that the fine was just 4.5% of Google's revenue in 2017 versus a 10% cap allowed under EU rules.

technology,Self-driving startup Aurora maps out commercial strategy," PALMER, Texas, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Self-driving startup Aurora says it has discovered a path to turn costly self-driving vehicles into a profitable business, showcasing its technology to investors this week ahead of a public listing it hopes will provide some $2 billion in additional funding. The move comes as several autonomous trucking companies prepare to launch driverless routes in the coming years and begin signing up industry partners and customers in an effort to turn long-elusive self-driving into a profitable reality. Unlike some of its competitors, Aurora wants to provide both autonomous freight trucking and robotaxi services, saying the combination will lower costs, provide greater revenue streams and allow technology transfer. ""Trucking allows us to build a profitable, scalable business that funds the further development of ride-hailing and brings down the cost of hardware,"" Sterling Anderson, Aurora's co-founder and chief product officer, said in an interview. He spoke at the company's South Dallas truck terminal, where investors, analysts and journalists rode in one of its autonomous highway trucks with two safety drivers in place. Autonomous vehicle (AV) companies have yet to generate significant revenue although investors have poured billions into their development. Trucking has emerged as the most immediate opportunity to commercialize AVs, fueled by growth in e-commerce and a shortage of drivers. Drivers currently account for more than 40% of per-mile costs and can drive no more than 11 hours per day - restrictions that do not apply to automated trucks. Graphic on trucking costs: Aurora, which plans to go public this year through a merger with blank-check firm Reinvent Technology Partners Y It plans to launch fully driverless trucks at the end of 2023, with robotaxis to follow a year later. Anderson said its ride-hail business would initially focus on high-margin airport and business-district trips that do not require robotaxis to navigate complex urban environments. But the four-year-old Bay Area firm faces fierce competition from well-funded startups including Alphabet Inc's The ability to strike partnerships is key, said Anderson.

technology,"Facebook could face hefty fine in Russia over banned content, says regulator"," MOSCOW, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Russian authorities on Thursday warned social media giant Facebook Upping the ante in its standoff with U.S. Big Tech, state communications regulator Roskomnadzor told Reuters it was planning to send Facebook's representatives in Russia an official notification saying it had repeatedly failed to remove banned information. That, it said, could lead to a fine of 5% or 10% of Facebook's annual Russian turnover unless the situation is remedied. Facebook's violations include failing to remove posts containing child pornography, drug abuse and extremist content, the Vedomosti daily reported separately. Facebook had no immediate comment. Moscow has increased pressure on foreign tech companies over the last year as part of a long-running push to assert greater sovereignty over its segment of the internet, including efforts to make companies store Russians' personal data on its territory. On Wednesday, Russia threatened to block YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc. Earlier this year, Roskomnadzor wrote to Facebook and other social media firms demanding they remove posts containing calls for minors to participate in anti-government protests after the arrest of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Vedomosti cited experts who estimated Facebook's annual Russian turnover at around 12 billion roubles ($165 million). Reuters could not immediately verify that estimate. Roskomnadzor has opened 17 different administrative cases against Facebook this year for failing to delete banned content, court documents showed, with 64 million roubles owed in fines or pending. A turnover fine would dwarf those levied so far. ""Facebook's administration has not paid the fines,"" Vedomosti cited Roskomnadzor as saying.

technology,New money: Central banks lay out operating manual for digital cash," LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A group of central banks sketched out a potential operating manual for digital cash on Thursday as they aim to strike a balance between keeping up with cryptocurrencies and concerns that the new technology could upend commercial lenders. Worried that the explosion of bitcoin and its ilk could weaken their control of money, policymakers from Beijing to Washington are exploring central bank digital currencies, known as CBDCs. And while a widely-used digital dollar or euro may still be years away, work by central banks is gathering pace as consumers increasingly ditch coins and notes in favour of digital payments on debit or credit cards and mobile phones. The seven central banks - including those in the United States, Britain and the ECB in the euro zone, but not China - said publicly-used ""retail"" CBDC must harness both public and private players to mesh with existing payment systems. The tech should be useable with existing domestic payments systems, with strategies for adoption tailored to on-the-ground economic conditions, said the central banks, working alongside the Bank for International Settlements. The existing financial system must be given time to adjust to the introduction of CBDC, they said, flagging risks of what could amount to slow-motion bank runs if commercial bank customers suddenly shifted savings to the new tech. ""Regardless of the design, developing and running a CBDC system would be a major undertaking for a central bank,"" they said, stressing the involvement of private operators must be closely monitored to ensure public trust in the tech. STABILITY RISKS Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that are usually run by private actors, CBDCs would be equivalent to cash, issued and backed by central banks. They differ from the electronic money used in billions of transactions daily that is mostly funnelled via commercial banks. The People's Bank of China is the most advanced among major economies on CBDCs, and is planning its biggest digital yuan trial at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will ""soon"" release research examining the costs and benefits of a CBDC, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week. Commercial banks, fretting that a retail-focused CBDC could cannibalise their deposit bases, are trying to exert influence on their design. The central banks sought to downplay the threat of retail-focused CBDC to lenders' business models. ""Our analysis suggests the impacts on bank disintermediation and lending could be manageable for the banking sector,"" they said, with any impact likely limited in ""plausible"" levels of adoption.

technology,"China drafts new data measures, defines ""core data"""," BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China published new draft measures on Thursday aimed at bolstering its new data security law, including definitions of what it considered ""core"" and ""important"" data. China implemented the Data Security Law on Sept. 1. which  requires all companies in China to classify the data they handle into several categories and governs how such data is stored and transferred to other parties. But lawyers have Thursday's draft measures describe in detail three categories of data - ordinary data, important data, and core data. The authorities describe ordinary data as data with a minimal ability to impact society at large, or that will affect a small number of individuals or enterprises. Important data is defined as data that poses a threat to China's national and economic interests or impact the rights of individuals and organizations, and has an ""obvious cascading effect"" across a range of industries and enterprises. Core data, meanwhile, is defined as data that poses a ""serious threat"" to China's national and economic interests. Disruption of important data could cause ""major damage,"" leading to ""large-scale shutdowns,"" or ""large-scale network and service paralysis."" The regulator adds that organizations may ""self-assess"" the security of ordinary data, but must conduct annual assessments at least once each year. Organizations must also receive approval for cross-border transfer of core data and important data via a special mechanism, the rules state. Data policy has become one of several areas regulators have targeted amid an ongoing crackdown on industry that has unfolded throughout the past year.

technology,ABB launches world's fastest charger to plug into surging e-car market," ZURICH, Sept 30 (Reuters) - ABB The company is launching the new Terra 360 modular charger as it presses ahead with plans to float its electric vehicle (EV) charging business, which could be valued around $3 billion. The device can charge up to four vehicles at once, and can fully charge any electric car within 15 minutes, ABB said, making it attractive to customers worried about charging times which can run to several hours. ""With governments around the world writing public policy that favours electric vehicles and charging networks to combat climate change, the demand for EV charging infrastructure, especially charging stations that are fast, convenient and easy to operate, is higher than ever,"" said Frank Muehlon, president of ABB's E-mobility Division. Globally the number of electric vehicles registered increased by 41% during 2020 to 3 million cars, despite the pandemic-related downturn in the total number of new cars sold last year, according to the International Energy Agency. The growth trend has accelerated in 2021, with electric car sales rising by 140% in the first three months of the year, the IEA said. ABB's Terra 360, which can deliver a charge giving 100 kms (62 miles) of range in less than three minutes, will be available in Europe by the end of the year. The United States, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions are due to follow in 2022. ABB declined to give a price range for the product, which is aimed more at business clients like fuelling stations, stores and companies rather than the private garages of motorists. ABB Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren said in July that investor materials for the IPO of its electric vehicle charging business will be ready in the fourth quarter of this year, with a potential flotation targeted for early 2022.

technology,China's electric carmakers make their move on Europe," MUNICH/BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China's electric carmakers are darting into Europe, hoping to catch traditional auto giants cold and seize a slice of a market supercharged by the continent's drive towards zero emissions. Nio Inc Other brands unfamiliar to many Europeans that have started selling or plan to sell cars on the continent include Aiways, BYD's Yet Europe, a crowded, competitive car market dominated by famous brands, has proved elusive for Chinese carmakers in the past. They made strategic slips and also contended with a perception that China, long associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. Indeed, Nio Chief Executive William Li told Reuters he foresees a long road to success in a mature market where it is ""very difficult to be successful"". Chinese carmakers may need up to a decade to ""gain a firm foothold"" in Europe, the billionaire entrepreneur said - a forecast echoed by He Xiaopeng, CEO of electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng These new players, many of which have only ever made electric vehicles, believe they have a window of opportunity to finally crack the lucrative market. While electric car sales in the European Union more than doubled last year and jumped 130% in the first half of this year, traditional manufacturers are still gradually shifting their large vehicle ranges over to electric and have yet to flood the thirsty market with models. ""The market is not that busy yet, if you compare it with combustion-engine models where each of the major carmakers has a whole range of vehicles,"" said Alexander Klose, who heads the foreign operations of Chinese electric vehicle maker Aiways. ""That is where we think we have an opportunity,"" he added on a drive around Munich in a U5, a crossover SUV on sale in Germany, the Netherlands Belgium and France. The U5 starts at 30,000 euros ($35,000) in Germany - below the average new car price and most local EV prices - before factoring in 9,000 euros in EV subsidies  - and comes in just four colours and two trim levels to minimize costs. 'GERMAN PEOPLE BUY GERMAN CARS' As Chinese carmakers gear up to enter Europe, they are trying out different business models, from relying on importers,  low-cost retail options or building up more traditional dealerships. The new reality that top Western carmakers like BMW Antje Levers, a teacher who lives in western Germany near the Dutch border, and her husband owned a diesel Chevrolet Orlando but wanted a greener option. They bought an Aiways U5 last year after plenty of research to fend off criticism for not buying local, and loves its handling and low running costs. She said people had told her: ""You can't buy a Chinese car, they're plastic and cheap and do not support German jobs."" But she feels that is no longer true in a global car industry where you find German auto parts in Chinese cars and vice versa. ""German people buy German cars, so to buy a Chinese car you need to have a little courage,"" the 47-year-old added. ""Sometimes you just have to be open for new things."" NIO LANDS IN NORWAY WITH NOMI Nio launches its ES8 electric SUV alongside a NIO House - part-showroom, part-cafe and workspace for customers in the capital of Norway, a country that's also the initial base for  Xpeng. Norwegian state support for EVs has put the country at the forefront of the shift to electric. It makes sense as a European entry point because customers are used to electric vehicles so only have to be sold on an unknown Chinese brand, said Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association. ""If you go to another European country you may struggle to sell both,"" said Bu, adding that her organisation has talked extensively with a number of Chinese EV makers keen to learn market specifics and consumer culture before launching there. She is uncertain, though, how consumers will react to Nio's approach of swapping out batteries for customers rather than stopping to charge them, or the carmaker's ""But where the Chinese are really at the forefront is the technology,"" she added, referring in particular to Nomi, the digital assistant in the dashboard of Nio's cars. NEWCOMERS' STRATEGIES DIVERGE One size does not fit all. While Nio and Xpeng have been hiring staff building up their organizations in Norway, SAIC's MG works through a car importer to sell cars in a handful of European markets. Aiways is trying an lower-cost approach to selling cars in Europe, though Klose says it varies by market. In Germany, for instance, the company sells its cars through Euronics, an association of independent electronics retailers, rather than building traditional dealerships. It aims to sell across the EU by next year and to enter the U.S. market by 2023, said Klose, a former Volvo and Ford executive. Past failed attempts by Chinese carmakers to conquer Europe are unlikely to hurt Chinese EV makers today, as consumers have grown accustomed to electronics coming from China, he added. Such failures included Brilliance in 2007, whose vehicle received one out of five stars in a German car crash test, damaging the brand. ""The fact there are more Chinese carmakers entering the market will also help us, as it will make Chinese brands more accepted by consumers,"" Klose said. Selling cars to Europeans is a ""tough business, especially if your product isn't well known,"" said Arnie Richters, chairman of Brussels-based industry group Platform for Electromobility.

technology,"U.S., EU agree to work on chip supplies, tech rules, China trade"," PITTSBURGH/WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The United States and European Union agreed on Wednesday to deepen transatlantic cooperation to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, curb China's non-market trade practices and take a more unified approach to regulating big, global technology firms. Launching a new forum, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC), senior cabinet officials from both continents also pledged to cooperate on the screening of investments on export controls for sensitive dual-use technologies and on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The statement did not mention China but said: ""We stand together in continuing to protect our businesses, consumers, and workers from unfair trade practices, in particular those posed by non-market economies, that are undermining the world trading system."" The Biden administration has kept in place tariffs imposed by former U.S. president Donald Trump but has sought to differentiate itself by collaborating more with allies in its approach to China. The meetings were led by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis, and European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager. They met in a robotics and AI technology development center built inside the rusted skeleton of a former steel rolling mill topped with solar panels, a symbol of Pittsburgh's post-industrial rebirth as a tech hub. The meeting was nearly derailed by French anger over a U.S. decision this month to supply Australia with nuclear submarines, which prompted Canberra to scrap a $40 billion submarine contract with France. But the U.S. and EU governments backed a joint declaration to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, focusing initially on easing short-term supply bottlenecks and later on identifying longer-term vulnerabilities and ""strengthening our domestic semiconductor ecosystems, from research, design to manufacturing, with a view to improving resilience."" They said they would work to avoid a subsidy race to attract chip investments and seek ""the right incentives."" The statement did not specify a time frame for a second TTC meeting, but EU officials said this would likely take place in the spring of 2022 in Europe. BIG TECH POWER Reuters ""We are committed to transatlantic cooperation regarding platform policies that focus on disinformation, product safety, counterfeit products, and other harmful content,"" the statement said. With the United States and Europe trying to restrain the growing power of American tech giants such as Alphabet's Vestager, who has taken a tough stance on the U.S. tech industry for years, said the discussions on AI were among the meeting's biggest takeaway. ""Minds are meeting for artificial intelligence to be trustworthy, to be human centered, and to have a risk based approach,"" Vestager told reporters after the meeting. The new tech and trade council has formed 10 working groups to deepen cooperation on these areas and others that include climate and clean technologies, communications technology security, and misuse of technology to repress human rights. Several tech EU officials said the meeting's participants did not discuss one of the biggest transatlantic trade irritants - U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum that have prompted retaliatory EU duties on U.S. bourbon whiskey and motorcycles. On Tuesday, Dombrovskis said time was running short for the sides to reach agreement before an end-November deadline, but added the EU was ready to look at similar arrangements agreed by Canada and Mexico that lifted U.S. tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports to the United States in 2019.

Eutelsat, one of the world's leading commercial satellite operators, has turned down Drahi's initial proposal, one of the sources said, adding the price was deemed too low but talks remained active. Drahi and Eutelsat were not immediately available for comment. Bpifrance declined to comment.

technology,"Russia threatens to block YouTube, Kremlin urges 'zero tolerance'"," MOSCOW, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday threatened to block YouTube and the Kremlin called for ""zero tolerance"" towards the video hosting giant after it removed Russian state-backed broadcaster RT's German-language channels from its site. The online video company owned by Alphabet Inc On Wednesday YouTube said it would block all anti-vaccine content, moving beyond COVID-19 to include content that alleges vaccines cause chronic health effects or contains misinformation on the substances in vaccines. Russia said it was considering retaliating against German media and also accused YouTube of ""unprecedented information aggression"" after the company's move against the RT channels. The row creates a new line of tension in Russia's standoff with foreign tech giants and its long-running push to assert greater sovereignty over its segment of the internet. Russian state communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it had written to Google and demanded that the YouTube restrictions on the RT channels be lifted. Russia could partially or fully restrict access to YouTube if it failed to comply, it added. Google declined to comment on the matter. 'ZERO TOLERANCE' Russia could impose measures to force YouTube to comply with its laws, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that the law appeared to have been broken in this case. ""There should certainly be zero tolerance for this kind of breaking of the law,"" he said. Russia's foreign ministry said it would draw up ""a proposal to develop and take retaliatory measures against the YouTube hosting service and the German media"". Vasily Piskarev, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary commission to investigate foreign meddling, said Russia had grounds to take measures against Deutsche Welle, the TASS news agency reported. Christian Mihr, executive director at Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Germany, said the threat of action against German journalists was ""completely inappropriate"". Berlin denied an allegation by the Russian foreign ministry that YouTube's decision had been made with clear and tacit support from the German authorities and local media.

technology,"CNN denies Australians access to its Facebook pages, cites defamation risk"," SYDNEY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - CNN said it is preventing Australians from accessing its Facebook Inc The move makes CNN, which is owned by AT&T Inc The ruling has come under much fire with defamation lawyers accusing Australia of not keeping up with technological change and noting the contrast with the United States and Britain where laws largely protect publishers from any fallout from comments posted online. Australia is currently reviewing its defamation laws but in the meantime, other global news organisations, especially those that feel they can easily live without an Australian Facebook audience, are likely to follow CNN's lead, the lawyers said. ""This is the first domino to fall,"" said Michael Bradley, managing partner of Marque Lawyers. For Australian media companies, the ruling also adds a layer of complication to their relationship with Facebook, just as many of them begin to benefit from CNN's main Facebook page showed an error message when accessed from Australia on Wednesday. The U.S. news organisation said Facebook declined a request to help it and other publishers disable public comments in the country following ""We are disappointed that Facebook, once again, has failed to ensure its platform is a place for credible journalism and productive dialogue around current events among its users,"" a CNN spokeswoman said in a statement. A Facebook spokesperson said recent court decisions had shown the need for reform in Australian defamation law and the company looked forward to ""greater clarity and certainty in this area"". ""While it's not our place to provide legal guidance to CNN, we have provided them with the latest information on tools we make available to help publishers manage comments,"" the spokesperson said. 'OUTLIER' As in most of the world, social media is a central channel for distributing content in Australia and about two-thirds of its population of 25 million are on Facebook. About a third of Australians said they used Facebook to source news, a University of Canberra survey taken at the start of 2021 showed. But there has also been an explosion in defamation lawsuits, and state and federal chief lawyers are conducting a wide-ranging review into whether existing rules are appropriate for the internet age, and whether the rules fairly take into account whether or not a person has been harmed. In a submission to that review in May, an industry group representing Facebook and other internet platforms said liability for defamation should remain with content ""originators"" since they could more easily monitor and delete offending content. Mark Speakman, the attorney general for the state of New South Wales who is working on the review, said resolving the question of liability in online forums was a priority. ""Getting the balance right on any reform is crucial to balancing freedom of expression with the right of a person to protect their reputation,"" he said in an email. Matt Collins, a prominent defamation lawyer, said CNN's decision showed the importance of aligning Australian law with the United States and Britain. ""Australia is among Western democracies an outlier, in relation to the circumstances in which media organisations and any user of social media can be liable for content they didn't they themselves write or approve of,"" he said.

technology,Google tells EU court payments to phone makers gave Android a chance against Apple," LUXEMBOURG, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Payments to phone makers to pre-install only Google Search on their devices were not aimed at preventing competition but were necessary for Android to seize market share from Apple Google was addressing the General Court on the third day of a week-long hearing as it tries to get judges to dismiss a record 4.3-billion-euro ($3.7 billion) EU antitrust fine and a European Commission order to loosen its search engine grip on Android devices. The EU competition watchdog had taken issue with two kinds of deals made with phone makers, one being payments for only pre-installing Google Search on their devices known as revenue sharing arrangements (RSAs) because these shut out rivals. This was not the case and the payments were just to encourage phone makers, which were already generating money from other apps, to give Android a place, Google lawyer Assimakis Komninos told the court. ""Google had to offer an offsetting revenue stream. An incentive to convince them to open up and adopt the Android platform. At the same time, the RSAs also helped them to keep prices down and compete more successfully with Apple,"" he said. ""And obviously, Google was getting in return a promotional opportunity, sole preinstallation, which allowed it to invest in a free OS (operating system), a free app store and so on."" On top of that, the RSAs only covered 5% of the market, Komninos said. Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan rejected the claim. ""What concerned them was competitors gaining traction,"" he said and the RDAs were ""the pinnacle of Google's interlocking practices"". A verdict is likely to come next year.

In a market update, ASML estimated revenue would hit 24 to 30 billion euros ($28 billion-35 billion) in 2025 with gross margins up to 55%. That compares with the previous forecast of a 15-to-24 billion euro range in the same year, at gross margins of at least 50%. ASML says it is benefiting from what it termed ""global megatrends in the electronics industry"" that will lead to 7.4 percent annual growth for chipmakers, with ASML taking a relatively larger share. The presentation comes as semiconductor makers scramble to address a global chip shortage and expand to meet future demand. ASML is operating at maximum capacity to supply major chip makers such as TSMC Wennink said the company is building enough capacity even for demand scenarios that go beyond the high end of its 2025 forecasts. ""We want to make sure we are not in the situation where we are today, where we simply cannot supply our customers with what they want. ASML makes lithography systems, large machines that use energy beams to map out the tiny circuitry of computer chips. Its most cutting-edge tools cost 160 million euros each and sit at the heart of semiconductor fabrication plants. At second quarter earnings in July, ASML forecast a 35% increase in sales to nearly 19 billion euros in 2021, at gross margins of better than 50%, putting it past the lower end of its 2025 range of goals.

technology,Some users say WeChat blocks China Evergrande messaging groups," ZHUHAI, China, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Some instant messaging groups used by people owed money by property giant China Evergrande Group Eight users across at least eight different groups, each numbering around 200 to 500 people, said they were prevented from sending new messages to the groups starting from Tuesday morning. Tencent declined to comment and the Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The crisis at Evergrande, weighed down under $305 billion in debt and in the midst of a cash crunch, poses a challenge for the government. It wants to impose financial discipline but analysts say it is wary of a messy collapse that could fuel unrest by local investors, suppliers and homebuyers. Angry homebuyers and retail investors launched protests in several cities in recent weeks, and many took to social media platforms like WeChat, the country's most popular messaging app, to voice their grievances. Earlier this month, Reuters witnessed protesters being taken away outside Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, and similar scenes have been shared in WeChat groups. On Wednesday, two WeChat users reported seeing the error message ""limits have been placed on this group because it violates relevant rules and regulations"". A screenshot seen separately by Reuters confirmed that wording. Three other users said the groups had been deleted from their WeChat app. Another two users also said they could not access their groups. Two people who had been members of some of the groups said separately that they were visited by Chinese law enforcement on Sunday and asked to sign papers pledging not to join any gatherings or do anything illegal. They declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. China's Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Evergrande's woes, which include missing payment on a global bond coupon last week, have rattled global markets but received scant coverage in official Chinese media, and Beijing has said little publicly about the situation. An Evergrande exchange filing on Wednesday said it would sell a 9.99 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) stake it owns in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd 2066.HK to a state-owned asset management company. Chinese social media companies are subject to strict laws requiring them to censor content that ""undermines social stability"" or is critical of the central government, controls that have tightened under President Xi Jinping. It was unclear whether other Chinese social media platforms were also blocking Evergrande posts. On the Twitter-like Weibo, videos of unhappy creditors confronting Evergrande staff as well as complaints targeting the property developer could be seen on Wednesday.

The top-end Lucid Air Dream Edition will be available in late October, followed by less expensive models: Grand Touring, Touring and Air Pure. The company said it has received more than 13,000 reservations for Lucid Air models, and it has increased the planned total production of the Lucid Air Dream Edition to 520 vehicles. A version of the Lucid Air Dream Edition, priced at $169,000, received an official U.S. government rating of a 520-mile (837 km) driving range, over 100 miles more than its closest rival, Tesla's Model S, which is priced at $89,990. The higher range helped lead to a 23% jump in Lucid's shares this month. Speaking at the production site, Lucid Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson, a former chief engineer on the Tesla Model S, said his company's cars have an advantage in battery technology and costs over the Model S. ""We've ridden customers of the fear of range anxiety,"" he said. ""The next big obstacle is cost effectiveness of electric cars. We've got to get the cost down."" He said the Air Pure, the least expensive version with a price tag of $77,400, will go into production late next year. EXECUTION CHALLENGE The company, founded in 2007, received funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in 2018 before ""(20)17 and (20)18 were brutal. The company was in a parlous state. And then I've got to say, we met a perfect partner,"" he said. Rawlinson, who left Tesla in 2012, faces tasks similar to those of Tesla in its early days, including how to address manufacturing challenges and scale up production. ""I think the big challenge for Lucid will be execution,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights. ""I think that they have a very good car. It's very attractive."" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in June that Tesla has canceled its plan to launch a Model S Plaid+, with a target driving range of 520 miles, Musk reiterated this month that ""production is hard"". ""Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard,"" he said, citing carmakers' razor-thin margins.

Tesla does not break out figures for the two high-end models. ""The Model S doesn't look fundamentally different from a Model S nine years ago,"" Abuelsamid said. ""In the premium market, customers are looking for the latest and greatest."" Musk in October 2020 cut the price of its Model S, shortly after Lucid announced the pricing of its base model.

Most applications using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services - free internet-to-internet voice and video calls - have been blocked in the United Arab Emirates for years, angering many On Wednesday Reuters found people were able to make and take voice calls using WhatsApp and Skype from the Expo site, which will open to businesses and other exhibitors from almost 200 countries on Friday. Expo organisers directed queries about the change to the UAE's Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority, which did not respond to requests for comment. Dubai is hoping to boost its economy by attracting 25 million business and tourist visits to the world fair which has been built from scratch on 4.3 sq km (1.7 sq mile) of desert. It was not immediately clear whether the relaxation will last beyond the six-month expo, or whether it would be applied to other areas of the UAE, a federation of seven emirates. On Wednesday, the internet services appeared to cut off again outside the site. The government has in the past said people can only use licensed services such as BOTIM, without spelling out its reasons. Other countries have made similar restrictions for security reasons and to protect the revenues of telecoms providers. The block on calls using the popular WhatsApp, FaceTime and Skype applications has particularly galled UAE residents who were separated from families and friends by restrictions during the pandemic. As the disease spread and education and work moved online, the UAE's two telecoms operators - Etisalat and Du - enabled Microsoft Teams over both wifi and mobile data connections as well as Blackboard, Zoom and CloudTalk.

technology,China unveils 'loyal wingman' armed drone concept," ZHUHAI, China, Sept 29 (Reuters) - China on Wednesday revealed a drone concept similar in mission - and appearance - to the U.S.-made Kratos The long-range FH-97 drone concept unveiled on Wednesday can carry different types of weapons, and has swarm and electronic warfare capabilities, said Wu Wei, a representative of China Aerospace Science Technology Corp's (CASTC) Feihong product line. He did not provide specifics in his presentation at Airshow China in Zhuhai. The United States, Britain, Australia, India and Russia are among the countries developing ""loyal wingman"" drones, which are cheaper and more expendable than crewed fighters. CASTC did not provide technical details of the FH-97 concept, nor say whether it was planned for export, though many foreign observers watched the presentation. The FH-97's appearance is nearly identical to the Kratos XQ-58A, which made its first flight in 2019. The XQ-58A has a maximum speed of Mach 0.85 and a range of about 2,200 nautical miles. Zhang Zhongyang, vice president of CASTC said the plan was to turn Feihong into an ""international top-notch brand??and become a major player at the centre stage of the world arena."" China has exported military drones to countries including the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Serbia. ""The chief customer is certainly the PLA, but in recent years the Chinese are also aggressively marketing these systems for exports,"" said Collin Koh, a defence research fellow with Singapore's Rajaratnam School of International Studies. China also used the country's biggest air show to display the weapons capability of one of its most advanced stealth attack drone projects, the GJ-11. The Global Times reported that the GJ-11 on display at the show had its two weapons bays open for the first time. Inside each were four unidentified munitions that appeared to be precision air-to-ground glide bombs. Bradley Perrett, a specialist on Asian aerospace and defence, said the GJ-11 was designed to slip undetected through radar coverage and attack heavily defended targets. ""In doing that, it would take the place of a much larger and more expensive fighter with a pilot,"" he said.

Ilya Sachkov, 35, who founded Group IB, one of Russia's most prominent cyber security firms, was arrested on Tuesday, the RTVI TV channel reported as law enforcement officers carried out searches at the Moscow offices of the firm. State news agency TASS cited an unnamed security source as saying Sachkov was accused of working with unspecified foreign intelligence services and of treason that hurt Russia's national interests. He denied both allegations, it said. Group IB said in a statement it was sure Sachkov was not guilty of the allegations, but that it was unable to comment further on them. There was no official comment about the case from the security services. Moscow's Lefortovo district court said it had ordered Sachkov to be held in custody for two months. State treason is punishable by up to 20 years in jail. The details of such cases seldom come to light in full because of their classified nature. Global IB focuses on investigating high-tech crimes and online fraud, with a global client base that includes banks, energy companies, telecoms firms and Interpol. More searches took place at the St Petersburg offices of Group IB and other unnamed companies on Wednesday, the RIA news agency cited a security source as saying. Sachkov is a well-known figure in the business and IT sectors and has also met President Vladimir Putin at least once. He is the latest in a long series of people, including scientists, soldiers, officials and a former journalist, to be accused of treason in recent years. Boris Titov, presidential commissioner for entrepreneurs' rights, called on investigators to disclose information about the case against Sachkov. The Kremlin rejected the idea the case could hurt Russia's business climate during a conference call and said it was linked to state treason, not business. Group IB said the searches at its offices had begun on Tuesday morning, with law enforcement officials leaving that same evening. It said it had no information about why the searches were being conducted. The RTVI TV channel said Sachkov had been detained on Tuesday, citing a source in law enforcement. An RTVI correspondent also reported that men were dragging things from Group IB's office to a van parked outside.

technology,EU backs U.S. tech trade declaration after French concerns," BRUSSELS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - European Union governments committed to a joint EU-U.S. declaration on technology cooperation on Wednesday, just in time for a key transatlantic meeting, after France threatened to block it unless it was watered down, EU diplomats said. Senior U.S. and European Union officials aim to discuss semiconductor shortages, artificial intelligence and tech competition issues at the inaugural meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) on Wednesday. The TTC meeting had been in doubt last week because of French anger over Australia's scrapping of a $40 billion submarine contract and decision to opt instead for a deal with the United States and Britain to buy nuclear-powered vessels. EU diplomats said France wanted to strike out a reference to a second meeting in spring 2022, when the French presidential election will take place. It also sought to soften language on a proposed semiconductor supply chain partnership that said the EU and the United States were mutually dependent, the diplomats said. After talks until late on Tuesday, reference to the second meeting was struck and the semiconductor passage was adjusted to highlight short-term, rather than long-term, supply dependency. The revised text was cleared on Wednesday at a meeting of EU ministers on competitiveness of the EU market. Diplomats said French reservations were less related to the submarine dispute and more to France's stronger belief in EU autonomy. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai will host European Commission vice presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager in a forum in Pittsburgh also designed to set tech standards.

technology,Drone images give hope for return of kelp on U.S. West coast," GUALALA, Calif., Sept 29 (Reuters) - (This Sept. 29 story has been refiled to Corrects size of 2019 kelp canopy in paragraph 7) Tranquil images of the Pacific Ocean taken by a drone show that California's kelp forests may be making a comeback after years of depletion, bringing good news in the fight against climate change. Kelp, which reduces global warming by soaking up carbon dioxide from the air via photosynthesis, has died off dramatically along Northern California's coast, with one study calculating a loss of more than 95% since 2013 due to rising sea temperatures and disease. But a team from environmental group Nature Conservancy has spotted signs of a partial recovery of kelp forests during surveys off the coast of Mendocino and Sonoma counties by drone. The group first started trying to survey kelp forest from the sky in 2019 but there was hardly anything to see, said Vienna Saccomanno, who heads Nature Conservancy's kelp monitoring and mapping program. An explosion in the population of sea urchins, which consume kelp, added to the catastrophe. ""There was just no kelp, literally, little to no kelp. And to be out here in 2021 and see this strong uptick in kelp is just so exciting as a scientist,"" she said. Flying 400 feet (120 m) up but close to the shore, the drones take pictures which are then weaved into a mosaic-like image to get a fuller understanding of kelp forests. Scientists have spotted much more of the brown seaweed than in recent years, which Saccomanno attributes to a recent upswelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters which help kelp thrive. In 2019, the Nature Conservancy's drone survey found an average size of kelp canopy of less than one acre per survey site and in 2020 that had increased to 5.5 acres. The numbers are not yet in for this year. Kelp canopies are still below the historic average though. ""We know that this ecosystem is still not fully in balance and there's still restoration work to be done,"" Saccomanno said. The drone technology is vital for providing data on the health of the kelp, said Kirk Klausmeyer, director of data science of Nature Conservancy's California chapter. ""When dealing with problems like this, we really have to get as much data as possible. And drones allow us to get really high-resolution imagery of individual kelp plants,"" he said. Our Standards: U.S. Congress progressives on Tuesday signaled a new willingness to shrink the cost, but not the scope, of President Joe Biden's multi-trillion-dollar plan to broaden social programs and tackle climate change, as they struggle to reach a deal with party moderates."

The California-based startup, which went public via a shell company this year, has secured the $4.4 billion it needed until the end of next year but would not wait until then to raise more cash, Peter Rawlinson told Reuters. ""This is a capital intensive business,"" he said, adding that the company was on track to achieve its production target of 20,000 vehicles in 2022 and 50,000 in 2023. He said the latest funding ""sees us through to the end of 2022. So it doesn't see us right through to project Gravity,"" a reference to the firm's electric sport utility vehicle planned for release in late 2023.

Lucid shares were up 6.5% in premarket trading on Wednesday. 'FANTASY' He said there was an ?�undue fascination"" with Tesla's new 4680 battery format, adding the current cells that helped Lucid achieve an industry-leading driving range showed more promise in the near term. Tesla has canceled its plan to launch its longest-range car Model S Plaid+ with its new batteries. Rawlinson said Tesla's bigger battery has a cost advantage, and has the opportunity to reduce internal resistance if it is incorporated with tabless architecture, a difficult technology. ""People are thinking that 4680 is this huge leap that is gonna transform the electric car. I don't see that one. I think that is the fantasy,"" he said. He said Lucid would have a team looking at all these battery formats in due course. Tesla did not immediately responded to Reuters' request for comment. It was a ""reasonable bet"" that in a year's time, the industry's chip shortage would ease, Rawlinson said, echoing comments made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who said last week that new semiconductor plants being built would mean the shortage was short term. Rawlinson said the company was redesigning one printed circuit board to avoid any problems that could affect the supply of one chip in the medium term.

Sept 29 (Reuters) - QC Ware, a quantum computer software startup based in Silicon Valley with high profile customers like Goldman Sachs Group, Inc, said on Wednesday it raised $25 million. The funding round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies, an investment arm of Koch Industries, and Covestro AG Researchers believe quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers, potentially making possible tasks such as mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to boosting the power of artificial intelligence. While there is some debate about when quantum computers will be able to crack real world problems, many companies are dedicating resources to ensure they are ready, bringing revenue to startups like QC Ware, said CEO Matt Johnson. ""Companies that come to us are ones who didn't move quickly on machine learning and A.I. and found themselves flat footed,??said Johnson. Koch Industries is one of them, according to Navin Maharaj, Director at Koch Disruptive Technologies. ""With quantum we're trying to get ahead of the eight ball a bit,"" said Maharaj. QC Ware said its software can operate on any type of quantum computer. It works with companies to develop quantum algorithms to solve industry specific problems. Johnson said QC Ware is focused on the chemical industry for drug development and financial services, two areas where he thinks quantum computers will have early practical uses. The latest funding will help the company expand its engineering team, said Johnson. It currently has about 35 employees and will build that out to about 55 in the next 12 to 18 months.

technology,Samsung fined $47 mln for price fixing in Netherlands," AMSTERDAM, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Electronics maker Samsung The market regulator said Samsung had pushed up the prices of its televisions in the Netherlands for years, by constantly urging retailers to raise their prices if they were selling them below Samsung's preferred market rate. This practice undermined competition between seven of the largest online electronics stores in the Netherlands, the ACM said, as Samsung made it clear to all retailers involved that their competitors would also follow its pricing policy. Samsung also reached out to retailers if their competitors complained about TVs being sold too cheap, documents obtained by the regulator showed. ""Samsung's advice was not individual and not without consequences,"" the watchdog said. ""Its behaviour distorted competition and raised prices for consumers."" Samsung said it would appeal the fine, as it maintained it had never forced retailers to use its price advice and that stores had always been free to determine their own strategy. But the regulator said that Samsung should have known that its efforts to influence prices went far beyond normal guidance and was in fact a way to structurally determine the market prices of its televisions.

technology,Analysis: Auto industry wonders whether Ford-SK battery plants will sport the union label," WASHINGTON/DETROIT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The plan for Ford Motor Co The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents about 150,000 hourly workers at the U.S. plants for General Motors Co The fate of these workers is so important because building electric cars and the batteries that power them is largely where the job growth lies in the auto sector. If the UAW strikes out in the Ford-SK plants, it could face the risk of further erosion of membership as consumers buy fewer gasoline-powered vehicles. The UAW has strong allies in Washington as U.S. President Joe Biden has called on U.S. automakers to deepen their relationships with the union, and House Democratic leaders want to give union-made U.S. electric vehicles an extra $4,500 in consumer retail incentives. However, Elon Musk, the chief executive of EV leader Tesla Inc While unions have seen a broad uptick in public support, the UAW faces a huge challenge in organizing new plants, said Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research. Many of the newer plants are located in union-resistant states in the South and West, such as western Tennessee where the new Ford truck and battery plants will be built. ""It is going to be a challenge and one that will test the new leadership of the UAW??to organize the new truck assembly plant, Dziczek said. ""It would be a big win for the UAW to organize the battery plants."" TICKING CLOCK The clock is ticking for the UAW, in which membership has  declined sharply over the decades. UAW President Ray Curry, who attended a Ford event in Tennessee on Tuesday to celebrate the company's Ford's North American chief operating officer, Lisa Drake,  told Reuters that ""in any environment, it's up to a workforce to decide if they want to be represented."" She was quick to add, however, that Ford is the largest employer of UAW-represented employees in the United States and that it has asked SK not to take an anti-union stance when it comes to the joint-venture battery plants to be built in Tennessee and Kentucky. Biden's administration is backing the union. White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese tweeted on Tuesday that ""Ford's announcement to invest in good-paying union jobs and wages shows that approach is starting to pay off."" Ford has not said those jobs will be unionized, and in any case it would be up to potential workers to vote in favor of organizing. GM faces the same kind of pressure for the U.S. battery plants it is building with LG Energy Solution, a unit of Korea's LG Chem The No. 1 U.S. automaker initially took the same stance as Ford that it was up to potential workers to decide on whether to unionize, but subsequently expressed strong support for efforts by the UAW to organize those plants without endorsing the union. The issue is certain to be the subject of contract talks between the UAW and Detroit's Big Three automakers before the current four-year agreement expires in late 2023. The union's push comes as it has unsuccessfully sought to organize plants like Volkswagen AG's In April, then-UAW President Rory Gamble called on GM and Ford to commit to union representation at new joint-venture EV factories. The UAW in the past has criticized GM for announcing a $1 billion investment to build EVs in Mexico, where union rights are seen as far weaker and hourly pay is much lower, and has also criticized Ford for opting to build some EVs in Mexico rather than in Ohio.

technology,Taiwan proposes tightening law to prevent China stealing technology," TAIPEI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Taiwan's government on Wednesday proposed tightening a law to prevent China from stealing key technology, reflecting concerns in Taipei that Beijing is stepping up espionage efforts against the island. Taiwan is home to a thriving and world-leading semiconductor industry, used in everything from fighter jets to cars, and the government has long worried about Chinese efforts to copy that success, including through industrial espionage, poaching talent and other methods. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said it was proposing a revision to an existing law governing China relations that would require people getting government money for certain technology to seek permission before going to China. There would be fines of up to T$10 million ($360,555) for those who breach the law. The council did not specify what constitutes ""national core technology"" or how the government defines ""certain subsidies"" provided by them, saying it will seek help from the technology ministry and further amend the regulations. A senior Taiwan government official familiar with the matter told Reuters last month the revision was meant to protect the island's manufacturing technology for advanced chips, which industry experts say is generations ahead of China's. Taiwan's parliament will need to pass the revisions. Four lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party proposed Taiwan blames China for most cases of industrial espionage by foreign forces discovered in recent years.

When deployed, the FAA said it anticipates annually saving more than 7 million gallons (26.5 million liters) of fuel and eliminating more than 75,000 tons of CO2 emissions. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a press briefing the software came from the strategy ""the trajectories to get where you wanted out in space to other planets...

Lawyers for Google and the EU competition executive clashed over the company's Mobile Application Distribution Agreements (MADAs) that require phone makers (OEMs) to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome browser app in return for licensing Google Play for free. ""This licensing model is what attracted OEMs to the Android platform, and what enabled those OEMs to offer a consistent and high-quality user experience at the lowest possible price,"" Google's lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid told the General Court. ""People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to,"" he said. Commission lawyer Carlos Urraca Caviedes rejected the argument, calling the deals and other restrictions Google's carrot-and-stick policy towards phone makers.

technology,Analysis: Huawei CFO's admissions likely won't help U.S. in case against company," Sept 28 (Reuters) - The admission by Huawei's chief financial officer that she misled a bank about the company's business dealings in Iran likely won't help the United States as it continues to prosecute Huawei for the same charges. While Meng Wanzhou's And if the government were to try to use her admissions as leverage in any negotiations aimed at avoiding a trial, experts said, Huawei would likely say what she admitted was the result of extortion, or even a fabrication. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment, as did a Huawei spokeswoman. A U.S. judge in Brooklyn on Friday accepted a deferred prosecution agreement between Meng and U.S. prosecutors to end the case against her. Meng appeared via video from Canada, where she had been fighting extradition since her arrest in 2018 on a U.S. warrant. Meng's arrest was a key source of As part of the agreement, Meng acknowledged that Huawei controlled a company that operated in Iran, that its employees were Huawei employees, and that she had made false statements about the company at a 2013 meeting with an executive at a global bank, earlier reported as HSBC Holdings PLC CROSS-EXAMINATION The statement of facts laid out in the agreement could be seen as an admission by a high-level officer of Huawei, said Roland Riopelle, a New York white-collar defense lawyer not involved in Meng's case, ""but if she is not available for cross-examination, it is almost certainly not admissible."" Meng In other cases, prosecutors typically call individuals like Meng to the witness stand to testify about their agreements with the government. But if Meng does not appear in court, Huawei cannot exercise its right to confront her as provided by the 6th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
""If she does not come back, and no one has the opportunity to cross-examine her, it is inadmissible,"" said Charles Stillman, another New York defense lawyer. The statement of facts identified Skycom Tech Co Ltd as a Hong Kong company that operated in Iran but was controlled by Huawei. It noted that Skycom was not a business partner, as Meng had claimed, and that Meng had falsely stated Huawei operated in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and sanctions. Prosecutors said the deception by Meng and colleagues was intended to obtain banking services from global financial institutions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The statement of facts also could be raised by the U.S. Department of Justice in talks with the company's lawyers in an effort to avoid trial, experts said, even if it would not be allowed in as evidence.
Washington lawyer Juan Morillo, who often handles high-profile white collar and cross-border cases, said it ""gives them some additional leverage in negotiations with Huawei."" But Morillo said the company could argue Meng's agreement was also the ""product of extortion"" because she may have felt forced to sign it to gain her freedom. So ultimately, he said, the value would be minimal. Huawei can also note that it did not sign the agreement and is not bound by it. In fact, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Saturday said ""the so-called 'fraud' charges against"" Meng were ""purely fabricated.""
""I've been in cases similar to this, and that's what the strategy is going to be with Huawei,"" said Morillo. ""They'll say, 'This is a fabrication. This is the product of extortion and it has no binding effect on us at all.'"" Huawei faces wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy charges that included Meng. It also faces other charges, including for violating sanctions on Iran, obstructing justice, and conspiring to steal trade secrets from U.S. technology companies. It has pleaded not guilty.

Google said a year ago that it would ban some cookies in its Chrome browser to increase user privacy and offer the Privacy Sandbox as an alternative. The Movement for an Open Web (MOW) said the proposal would give Google the power to decide what data can be shared on the web and with whom.

Senior U.S. and European Union officials aim to discuss semiconductor shortages, artificial intelligence and tech competition issues at the inaugural meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) on Wednesday. However, EU diplomats said France wanted to strike out a reference to a second meeting in spring 2022, when the French presidential election will take place. It also sought to remove language on a proposed semiconductor supply chain partnership that said the EU and the United States were mutually dependent, diplomats said. ""There is a consensus minus one,"" one EU diplomat said. Another EU diplomat said the French view was that security of supply went beyond just a short-term semiconductor issue, including for example vaccines, and that the United States itself did not want to be dependent on the European Union. France, the diplomat said, had stressed that the approach should be more cautious, with transatlantic trust also needing to be rebuilt. The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, said it was resolving outstanding minor issues and was confident of finalising the statement in good time for the Pittsburgh meeting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai will host  European Commission vice presidents Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager in a forum also designed to set tech standards. It was not clear how the EU members would reach agreement in time for Wednesday's TTC meeting, although the European Commission was talking with France and other EU countries, diplomats said. The six-hour time difference between Brussels and Washington was adding a further layer of complication. The TTC meeting had been in doubt last week because of French anger over Australia's scrapping of a $40 billion submarine contract and decision to opt instead for a deal with the United States and Britain to buy nuclear-powered vessels. Diplomats said French reservations were less related to this dispute and more to France's stronger belief in EU autonomy.

Based on the book by Beth Macy, the semi-fictional mini-series is produced by 20th Television and will air on Hulu starting Wednesday. Michael Keaton plays a small town doctor cajoled into prescribing OxyContin, made by Purdue, to the miners in his town. The actor said viewers will be engaged and enlightened by ""Dopesick."" ""People seemed to be, while they're watching it, realizing, 'Wait, this actually happened and is happening' and that's one of the really cool things about this particular series,"" Keaton said. Originally intended as a feature film, creator Danny Strong felt there were too many untold stories to fit into a two-hour window and decided on a mini-series instead. Kaitlyn Dever portrays Betsy, a member of the mining community who becomes addicted to opioids. She said she found the character to be one of the most difficult roles of her career. ""All of it was so important to me because I knew I was not only representing Betsy as a character and as a woman, but her character represents many victims and what they go through,"" Dever said.

lifestyle,Ancient factory exposes secrets of winemaking in the Holy Land," JERUSALEM, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A 1,500-year-old wine factory the size of a modern-day football field has been unearthed in Israel, showing how vintners met demand for high quality white wine popular throughout the ancient world. Excavated in the city of Yavne, some 30km (18 miles) south of Tel Aviv, the cluster of five winepresses was once able to produce about 2 million litres (530,000 gallons) a year, the Israel Antiquities Authority said. The stone structures were so well preserved that it is still easy to visualise the winemaking process - from the platform where piles of grapes split open under their own weight, releasing ""free-run"" juice for the choicest wines, to the grape-stomping floor and collection basins. Dozens of wine jugs, tall and thin, which were made in large kilns on site and able to hold up to 25 litres (6.6 gallons), were also found. The dig team said these were known as ""Gaza jars"" after the nearby port from which they were shipped abroad. Such jars have been found across Europe, evidence that the wine was in high demand. Wine was a common beverage in ancient times, served to children as well as adults, said Jon Seligman, one of the excavation directors. It was often used as a substitute for water, which was not always safe to drink, or as an additive to improve its taste and nutritional value. ""Having five huge winepresses right next to each other shows that there is industrial design over here,"" Seligman said, describing the complex, which authorities plan to open to the public. ""The apex of the wine production which was associated with the Gazan wines."" And did the final product taste like wines of today? It's impossible to know, Seligman said, while noting that ancient texts have described the beverage as a light white wine that was ""agreeable to the taste"".

Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya star in the hotly anticipated film, which hits U.S. and UK cinemas later this month and follows past attempts to take Herbert's 400-page book to the silver screen. Set in the future where noble families rule planetary fiefs, the story follows Paul Atreides (Chalamet), whose father takes on the stewardship of planet Arrakis, known as Dune to its native Fremen people and contested for its unique spice commodity found in its inhospitable desert. ""It was by far the most challenging thing I've done in my life,"" Villeneuve, known for ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Sicario"",  told Reuters. ""I had to find an equilibrium between the people who had read the book ... I wanted them to really feel that it was a profound homage to the spirit of the book. At the same time, I wanted people who knew nothing about the book to feel welcome in the world, not left aside."" The two-and-a-half-hour movie, described as part one of the story, is Chalamet's biggest project to date, something he says helped him relate to character Paul overcoming his fears. ""(I've) never been on a project of this size before,"" Chalamet said. ""Sometimes the things you're feeling on set can bleed into the natural arc or progression of a story."" Villeneuve's ""Dune"" follows Alejandro Jodorowsky's unsuccessful attempt in the mid-1970s and David Lynch's critically-panned 1984 version. With sweeping landscapes and dark mood, critics have lauded this film as a visual spectacle in reviews. ""It's a book that's been the source material for a lot of bigger ideas like 'Star Wars',"" actor Josh Brolin, who plays weapons master Gurney, said. ""The movie's been done in different eras with different technological possibilities. And now we're in an era that's so technologically advanced we're able to see that version of it."" Javier Bardem, who plays Fremen tribe leader Stilgar, said the mood on set was relaxed. ""I never felt that pressure on (Villeneuve) when he was working with us,"" he said. ""It's a huge one, and I wouldn't be able to hold it myself and have the humour, the joy and the attitude that he had on set."" Villeneuve said it was too early to talk about part two but Zendaya hopes her character Chani, who appears in Paul's visions, will be further explored. ""Anyone who's familiar with the books (knows) there?�s so much to dive into and there's so much still to come,"" she said. ""It truly is only the beginning.

lifestyle,Box Office: 'No Time to Die' Debuts Slightly Behind Expectations With $56 Million," LOS ANGELES, Oct 10 (Variety.com) - ""No Time to Die,"" the latest installment in the James Bond franchise, debuted to $56 million at the domestic box office, a result that fell somewhat short of expectations and signals that even one of the most storied brands in film history is still being forced to contend with a moviegoing landscape that has been dramatically altered by the pandemic. Heading into the weekend, ""No Time to Die was projected to make $60 million to $70 million in its first three days of release. Though not a disaster, the film's final weekend total was expected to be higher because it received positive reviews and represented Daniel Craig's final outing as the stylish secret agent. In light of the ongoing pandemic, assessing initial box office results for ""No Time to Die"" isn't as clear cut. For some movies, especially during a public health crisis, an opening weekend of $56 million would be cause for great jubilation. But ""No Time to Die"" is no ordinary film. It carries a massive $250 million production budget, to say nothing of the more than $100 million marketing spend. Add in the tens of millions it cost to delay ""No Time to Die,"" which was supposed to premiere in April of 2020 before the pandemic altered those plans, and box office experts estimate that, conservatively, ""No Time to Die"" needs to gross at least $800 million at the global box office to make money in its theatrical window. For Bond, the franchise has numerous marketing partners and ancillary tie-ins, with Rolex, Aston Martin and more, that could help cushion potential losses. Overseas, audiences have been turning out for ""No Time to Die"" at the international box office, where it has already made an impressive $145 million. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (""True Detective""), the 007 adventure has opened in most major markets except for China (set for Oct. 29), which is a popular territory for all things Bond. Globally, the film has collected $313 million. At the domestic box office, the slightly muted results for ""No Time to Die"" are attributable to several factors, including hesitation among older audiences to return to the movies and its lengthy two-hour-and-45-minute runtime, which limited the number of screenings per day. It's also the first Hollywood tentpole with real competition at the box office. Sony's comic book sequel ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" opened last weekend and has continued to pull in crowds, which may have cannibalized ticket sales for Bond. With ""No Time to Die"" claiming the No. 1 spot on domestic box office charts, the ""Venom"" follow-up slid to second place with $32 million, a figure that's more than many pandemic-era releases have made in their entire theatrical run. In total, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" has generated a mighty $141 million in North America and $185 million worldwide. Since Bond is a property that tends to skewed toward older audiences, a demographic that doesn't always make an effort to watch a film on its opening weekend, box office analysts have been encouraged by ""No Time to Die."" According to United Artists Releasing, the company distributing the film in the U.S., 25% of ticket buyers returned to theaters for the first time in more than 18 months for Bond. Among opening weekend crowds, 57% were over the age of 35 and 64% were male. It has an ""A-"" CinemaScore, a positive sign for the movie's long-term prospects. ""The audience is broad, with all age groups and segments well-represented, including the 35+ crowd, who have been slow to return to the movies,"" says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. ""If anything kept the film from over-performing this weekend, it is the younger groups, who are less committed to the series."" In a distant third place on domestic charts, ""The Addams Family 2"" generated $10 million, bringing its North American total to $31.1 million. The animated family comedy, from MGM and United Artists Releasing, is being offered simultaneously on premium video-on-demand platforms. Disney's superhero adventure ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" landed at No. 4 with $4.2 million in its sixth weekend in theaters. Globally, the Marvel comic book adaptation has surpassed $400 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest grossing film of the year. With $212 million in North America, it remains the highest earning movie of 2021 at the domestic box office. ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" a prequel to ""The Sopranos,"" rounded out the top five with a paltry $1.4 million in its sophomore outing. That puts ticket sales for the Warner Bros. movie, which premiered day-and-date on HBO Max, at a dismal $7.4 million. It cost $50 million to make.

Light sticks, a must-have accessory for hard-core enthusiasts of South Korean pop, have become pricier and harder to get due to the shortage that has hit production of anything from smartphones to cars. The glowing wands fans wave during concerts and virtual events are fitted with so-called microcontrollers for power management and to pair with a phone to change colors, and highlight how far the squeeze has rippled through various industries and aspects of everyday life. The price of light sticks, used by ""ARMY"" or fans of mega-band BTS and referred to as ""ARMY bombs"", has increased by $2 to $59 from Oct. 1, Hybe ""I sure hope prices won't get too high since a lot of ARMY and other fans too cannot afford such prices,"" said Pervushina Elizaveta, an entertainment company employee and a BTS fan from Estepona, Spain. Fans of South Korean boy band SEVENTEEN will have to cough up $3 more for their light sticks, while supporters of acts such as EXO, SHINee, Girls' Generation and YG Entertainment's BlackPink are entirely out of luck. SM Entertainment's Hybe, SM Entertainment and other top Korean entertainment companies did not respond to requests for comment. While the Grammy-nominated BTS plans to perform live in Los Angeles in November and December for the first time since the pandemic, other South Korean acts are scheduling online shows. Still, fans are looking forward to make the most of those, with light sticks on and sharing messages in chatrooms. ""It's a fun way to feel connected to other fans all around the world so when you do get to enjoy a concert even from home you can somehow feel part of something amazing!"" said Starla Stafford, a fan from Chattanooga, Tennessee. LONG WAIT Compounding the pain, semiconductors in light sticks are manufactured using older technologies and such low-end chips face the biggest shortage right now, said Jim Handy, an analyst with semiconductor market research firm Objective Analysis. Wait times for semiconductor deliveries have now stretched to up to six months, compared with the usual about two months, manufacturers said. ""I bulk ordered microcontroller chips in advance, hoping live events will be back next year, because the delivery time is long,"" said Ashton Jungmin Choi, a co-founder of FANLIGHT, a Seoul-based company that makes light sticks for bands such as BTS, EXO and SuperM. He said shipping charges have gone up three times, and chips cost 30% more compared with a year ago. ""It is very difficult to get any light stick. They are always in demand and it has been impossible to get the BTS Army Bombs,"" said Mette Kidal, owner of All In Kpop, a Denmark-based K-pop merchandise retailer that opened a new store in the country this month to cater to surging demand.

lifestyle,No time for the battery to die: Bond's Aston Martin goes electric," SILVERSTONE, England, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Daniel Craig may be saying goodbye as James Bond, but his iconic Aston Martin is about to be given a new lease of life, for an ultra-cool $1 million. Bond actually drove a DB5, which features again in the latest Bond movie, ""No Time To Die"". But the DB6 is regarded by many as the epitome of British motoring style since it was first unveiled in 1965. In a modern twist, the DB5 and DB6 are now being retrofitted to reappear in limited numbers as electric cars. ""For the women and men of tomorrow this, electrified, is what you should be driving,"" said David Lorenz, CEO and founder of Lunaz, which specialises in making classic cars electric, at the wheel of a DB6. ""You've got the aesthetic beauty which you will never get in a modern vehicle yet the aesthetics can now be combined with a modern powertrain,"" Lorenz said. Lunaz, based near Silverstone, home of the British Grand Prix, is producing limited numbers of an electric DB6. The company was founded, Lorenz said, to take upcycling to a whole new level and answer a tricky question - when internal combustion engines are banned, what are we going to do with the two billion vehicles already on the roads? ""I want to preserve these vehicles for future generations to come. My daughter is three years old. When she's of driving age she'll be driving electric cars and I want her to enjoy vehicles like this,"" Lorenz said. Each electrified Aston Martin DB6 Technological upgrades include the latest brakes, suspension and steering along with air conditioning and the electronic infotainment systems. The electric powertrains give the car a range of 255 miles. But what would Bond say when his beloved DB5 no longer makes that throaty roar? ""Bond has always been about modern technology,"" said Lorenz. ""Q would have loved to hand over the keys to an electrified Aston Martin. It suits Bond to the tee,"" said Lorenz. Lunez already electrifies a number of prestige cars from the bygone days of motoring, including Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar sportscar models. They will soon offer limited build-slots for the Aston Martin DB4 as well as Bond's iconic DB5, which achieved pop-culture status following the 1964 release of ""Goldfinger"". Prices are ?�on application??but expected to exceed $1 million, with the first deliveries expected in the third quarter of 2023. While Lunez is hoping to corner the market in retrofitting classic cars, the race to electrify is well and truly on for all modern supercar makers. These include Ferrari with their first electric supercar expected in 2025, while Rolls-Royce last week teased their first fully electric car, called 'Spectre'; coincidentally the same name as the shadowy crime organisation of the James Bond stories.

lifestyle,Japanese octogenarian skateboarder learns new tricks," OSAKA, Japan, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Yoshio Kinoshita is living proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks. The 81-year-old rides the ramps at his local skate park in the city of Osaka almost every morning, picking up tips from skateboarders decades younger than him. ""They are all my teachers,"" said Kinoshita, who worked as a technician in the construction industry before retiring and still works part time as an attendant in a bicyle parking lot. ""At first I was holding on to the railing"" he said, before he progressed to mastering a 180 degree turn and other tricks. Kinoshita picked up skateboarding just two years ago, when he bought a board he saw at a market selling unclaimed goods left on the railway. The 800 yen ($7.15) skateboard was a spur of the moment purchase that changed the Japanese octagenarian's life. In a country that has the most aged society in the world, with more than 35% of its population expected to be 65 and over by 2050, Kinoshita recommended skateboarding as a way to prevent dementia. ""It's a sport with a sense of tension,"" he said. ""Rather than zoning out, I think skateboarding improves the ability to think even just by a little bit."" ""For (old) people like me who try to learn new things, if we don't practice it little by little every day we will forget how to do it immediately,"" he said. ""That's why I think I have to (come here) and practice every day."" Kinoshita, who has two children and two grandchildren, said he watched skateboarders at the recent Tokyo Olympics in awe. All three medallists in the women's street skateboarding competition at the Games were in their teens, including the country's own ""They are really incredible,"" said Kinoshita.

lifestyle,Japanese scientists work up an appetite for lab-grown Wagyu beef," TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Japan's famed Wagyu beef, a delicacy that can cost more than $200 a pound at some top restaurants, could become much more affordable in the form of a lab-grown replica. Japanese scientists say they have succeeded in recreating Wagyu, renowned for its fat marbling, in a laboratory to produce something that could eventually look and taste like the real steak. Wagyu beef comes from a breed of black cattle, most famously cultivated in the Kobe area of Western Japan. Osaka University researchers led by Michiya Matsusaki used 3-D bioprinters and bovine stem cells to replicate Wagyu's distinctive marbling in a solid steak-like piece, rather than a minced form that has typified other attempts at cultured meat. It currently takes about three to four weeks to generate a cubic centimetre of cultured meat, so it's not ready for the grocer's aisle just yet. But as the techniques and efficiency improve, the method could produce something that mimics the real thing, Matsusaki said. ""If we are able to quickly produce a lot of meat from a few cells, there's a chance we can better respond to food and protein shortage issues in the future,"" Matsusaki told Reuters. Environmental and ethical concerns around the meat industry have driven interest in vegetable alternatives and the potential for lab-grown products. That has spurred strong growth in developers of real meat alternatives, including plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods Inc which is preparing for a public listing that could exceed $10 billion, sources say. Matsusaki said the bioprinting and culture techniques developed in his lab could also have applications in human medicine, such as growing replacements for damaged muscles. It now takes about 10,000 yen ($89.40) to produce a single gram of lab-grown Wagyu, but with more automation, the price could drop such that it would be marketable for the general public within five years, Matsusaki said.

lifestyle,"EXCLUSIVE Compassion not barbed wire should greet migrants, Nobel winner Gurnah says"," CANTERBURY, England, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Europe should greet migrants with compassion rather than barbed wire and the British government is ""rather nasty"" about those who seek asylum, said Tanzanian writer Abdulrazak Gurnah, who won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. Gurnah, who explored the legacies of imperialism on uprooted individuals in his books, said he was so shocked when he was phoned by the Swedish Academy to tell him of the prize that he thought it was a cold caller. Born in Zanzibar, now Tanzania, Gurnah moved to Britain as a student in 1968. His novels, the first published in 1987, have repeatedly portrayed displaced people - outsiders who are coming to terms with an identity in constant flux. He spoke poetically about the experience of migration - of leaving behind family and part of one's life for a life in a new society where one would always feel partly foreign. He said he felt the British government seemed nasty about those seeking asylum. ""Currently, it seems the government is rather nasty about people seeking asylum or people seeking admittance into this country,"" Gurnah, 73, told Reuters in his garden beside an Acer tree in Canterbury, southern England. ""It seems such a surprise to them that people coming from difficult places would want to come to a country that is prosperous. Why would they be surprised? Who wouldn't want to come to a country that is more prosperous? There is a kind of meanness in this response."" He casts his work as filling the gap between the academic work on colonialism and popular knowledge of it. ""This is where fiction can play a part: not by educating but by informing, by engaging, by speaking about things, by making people live,"" he said. Speaking a day after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to ""defend our history and cultural inheritance"" against those who attack Britain's past, Gurnah said he rejected attempts to celebrate selective histories. ""You have to know. If there are horrible things to be known, they have to be known. You can't just say 'they are rubbishing us',"" he said. RETHINKING MIGRATION Gurnah expressed amazement at the resolution and courage of those who travelled so far to escape their own countries for a new life. ""This somehow is constructed as if it is immoral - you know they use this phrase 'economic migrant' - as if to be an economic migrant is some kind of crime. Why not?"" ""Millions of Europeans over centuries left their homes for precisely that reason and invaded the world for precisely for that reason,"" he said. The other side of the equation, he said, was why people felt they had to embark on such perilous voyages for a new life. ""You have to ask the question: what is so horrible about where they are that they will do such things, that they will take such risks?"" he said. Europe, he said, should rethink its approach to migration. ""With greater compassion rather than with barbed wire - rather than a kind of discourse that Europe is going to be destroyed,"" he said. Gurnah said he was not advocating free-for-all ""open season"" migration but that there should not be an antagonistic and abusive representation of migrants. Brexit, he said, had revealed a ""certain meanness"" about Britain - and that lurking behind the vote to exit the European Union was another narrative about migrants from far beyond Europe's borders. Asked why there were so few Black Nobel Prize winners for literature - four including himself - Gurnah said the world was changing. ""The fact of the ignorance or the exclusion of non-European people from certain kinds of recognitions, or the exclusion of women from certain kinds of recognitions, is only just now beginning to become an issue or a thing people are concerned to put right. So we have got to wait and see,"" he said.

lifestyle,"Tanzanian novelist Gurnah wins 2021 Nobel for depicting impact of colonialism, migration"," STOCKHOLM, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature ""for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee,"" the award-giving body said on Thursday. Based in Britain and writing in English, Gurnah, 72, joins Nigeria's Wole Soyinka as the only two non-white writers from sub-Saharan Africa ever to win what is widely seen as the world's most prestigious literary award. His novels include ""Paradise"", set in colonial East Africa during World War One and short-listed for the Booker Prize for Fiction, and ""Desertion."" ""Gurnah's itinerant characters in England or on the African continent find themselves in the gulf between cultures and continents, between the life left behind and the life to come,"" Anders Olsson, head of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature, told reporters. ""I dedicate this Nobel Prize to Africa and Africans and to all my readers. Thanks!"" Gurnah tweeted after the announcement. Gurnah told Reuters by telephone that the prize was ""such a complete surprise that I really had to wait until I heard it announced before I could believe it."" He left Africa as a refugee in the 1960s amid the persecution of citizens of Arab origin on the Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar, which would unite with the mainland territory Tanganyika to form Tanzania. He was able to return only in 1984, seeing his father shortly before his death. His selection for the top honour in literature comes at a time of global tensions around migration, as millions of people flee violence and poverty in places such as Syria, Afghanistan and Central America, or are displaced by climate change, often taking tremendous risks during their passages. Olsson said the committee's choice was not a response to recent headlines, and it had been following Gurnah's work for years. In an interview later on Thursday with Reuters, Gurnah, however, expressed amazement at the resolution and courage of those who travelled so far to escape their own countries for a new life. ""This somehow is constructed as if it's immoral - you know they use this phrase 'economic migrant' - as if to be an economic migrant is some kind of crime. Why not?"" ""Millions of Europeans over centuries left their homes for precisely that reason and invaded the world for precisely for that reason,"" he said in his garden in the English city of Canterbury. 'CONSCIOUSLY BREAKS CONVENTION' Though Swahili was his first language, English became Gurnah's literary tool when he began writing at the age of 21. He has drawn inspiration from Arabic and Persian poetry as well as the Koran, but the English-language tradition, from William Shakespeare to V.S. Naipaul, would especially mark his work, the Swedish Academy said. ""That said, it must be stressed that he consciously breaks with convention, upending the colonial perspective to highlight that of the indigenous populations,"" said the academy, a 235-year-old Swedish language institute which awards the prize and the 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.14 million) that go with it. This was the second straight year that the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to a writer in English, and the fourth of the last six, an unusually long stretch for the prize to be dominated by a single language. In an interview with the Academy, Gurnah said many Europeans misunderstood the idea of migration. ""When many of these people who come, come out of both need, and also because, quite frankly, they have something to give,"" he said. ""They don't come empty-handed. A lot of them are talented, energetic people who have something to give."" ""So that might be another way of thinking about it. You are not just taking people in as if they are poverty-stricken nothings."" Eliah Mwaifuge, a professor of literature at Tanzania's University of Dar es Salaam, said Gurnah ""truly deserves this award,"" although the writer's work was better known abroad than in Tanzania itself. 'FEARLESS UNDERSTANDING' Peter Morey, a professor in the University of Birmingham's Department of English Literature, singled out Gurnah's ""fearless understanding of the connections between people and places and how they change over time in the face of the boundaries and borders designed to keep them apart."" ""In one of his novels he describes the memory of the exile as being 'a dim, gutted warehouse with rotting planks and rusted ladders where you spend time rifling through abandoned goods,'"" Morey said. Since Soyinka became the first African to win the prize in 1986, it has been won by Egypt's Naguib Mahfouz and three white African writers - South Africans Nadine Gordimer and J.M. Coetzee, and Doris Lessing, who was raised in British-ruled Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Past winners have primarily been novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, poets such as Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, or playwrights such as Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill. But writers have also won for bodies of work that include short fiction, history, essays, biography or journalism. Winston Churchill won for his memoirs, Bertrand Russell for his philosophy and Bob Dylan for his lyrics. Last year's award was won by American poet Louise Gluck. Beyond the prize money and prestige, the Nobel literature award generates a vast amount of attention for the winning author, often spurring book sales and introducing less well-known winners to a broader international public.

SkyUp Airlines, the privately-owned Ukrainian carrier that  employs Denysenko, decided to put an end to heels and pencil skirts after collecting feedback from flight attendants about their uniform. The new SkyUp uniform for women now includes white Nike sneakers and a loose orange suit with trousers and a silk scarf, both made by Ukrainian brands. White T-shirts will replace blouses. ""Shoes on heels look beautiful, I do not argue with that, but feet suffer and swell by the end of the flight. Sneakers are absolutely cool,"" Denysenko told Reuters. ""God forbid, but if a crew has to do a landing in water and an evacuation, heels can damage the ladder and it won't be very comfortable to swim in a skirt,"" she said. The company said they researched the history of cabin crew uniforms and decided to ditch what they called ""conservative"" elements of a flight attendant's look. Braids will now replace a tight-bun or pony-tail hairstyle. ""We found out that despite the fact that the image of a female flight attendant is very romanticized, their job demands a lot of physical training,"" the head of the SkyUp Airlines marketing department, Marianna Grygorash, said. The new uniform will be officially launched on Oct. 22. Grygorash said the company also plans to launch a new uniform for male crew.

lifestyle,S.Africa celebrates Archbishop Tutu as he turns 90," CAPE TOWN, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and veteran of South Africa's struggle against white minority rule, turned 90 on Thursday, celebrating his birthday with a low-key church service at Cape Town's St. George's Cathedral. Tutu, who has struggled with ill health in recent years, is often hailed as South Africa's moral conscience and the great reconciler of a nation divided by decades of racist politics. He attended the service in the place where he served as the country's first Black Anglican archbishop, wearing a dark suit. In 1984 Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent opposition to apartheid. A decade later, he witnessed the ends of that regime and he chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up to unearth atrocities committed during those dark days. ""Their plans failed miserably,"" Tutu's friend Reverend Allan Boesak said, giving a speech at the pulpit. ""You told them this government is evil and this government will very soon bite the dust. You did all that, Desmond Tutu."" Tutu led numerous marches and campaigns to end apartheid from St George's front steps, and as a result it became known as the ""People's Cathedral"" and a powerful symbol of democracy, according to the local government.

lifestyle,Al Capone?�s granddaughter hopes auction reveals human side of America?�s notorious gangster," SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct 6 (Reuters) - It was Christmas Day in 1946 when notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone took his wife and four granddaughters out for a walk onto the dock of their sprawling mansion on Palm Island, Florida. A picture shows ""papa"", as he was known to them, relishing his freedom after being released from Alcatraz where he served over seven years for tax evasion. That picture is among 174 items belonging to the Capone family that will go up for auction in Sacramento, California, on Friday. The items range from personal photographs to firearms to pocket watches and jewelry as well as furniture and kitchen ware. Al Capone?�s platinum and diamond Patek Philippe pocket watch is listed for $25,000 to $50,000, while his favorite Colt .45 pistol is estimated to fetch $100,000 to $150,000. A vintage hand-colored silver print of Al and his son, Sonny Capone, is expected to go for $10,000 to $15,000. Diane Capone, 77, the second of Al Capone?�s four granddaughters, said the decision to sell the items was based on her and her sisters getting older, as well as the increasing threat of wildfires to their homes in Northern California. Brian Witherell, consignment director at Witherell?�s Auction House, said nearly 1,000 bidders have registered for the auction from every U.S. state and 11 countries. ""The items that generate the most interest are the ones that you think of synonymous with a gangster figure like Al Capone, his guns and his fancy flamboyant jewelry,"" he said. Diane Capone said she hopes these items will reveal the human side of her grandfather, instead of the ruthless violence that plagued Chicago in the 1920s for which he has become infamous. The item that most exemplifies this, she said, is a personal letter Al Capone wrote to his son, Sonny Capone, from Alcatraz estimated between $25,000 and $50,000. ""It's such a lovely letter, and it is a letter that conveys a side of this man that the vast majority of people have no idea of,"" she said. ""These are not the words or the ideas of a man who is a ruthless gangster. These are the words of a loving father.""

lifestyle,Chinese labels flock to Paris to go global in high fashion," PARIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Chinese fashion labels, including Shang Xia, Icicle and Fosun Fashion Group, are embracing Paris as a springboard for their international ambitions, opening flagship stores in the city and hiring French designers to burnish their credentials. Chinese shoppers are the biggest buyers of luxury goods worldwide, including those of big European players like LVMH Chinese-owned brands are looking to expand abroad, sparking a trend of new labels being established in the country with the goal of international growth, said Yishu Wang, co-founder of Half a World, a firm that offers marketing advice to brands seeking to expand overseas. ""The Chinese market is very saturated and it's just become very, very expensive to grow,"" she said, noting that it was easier to find backing from investors when taking a global view. But in fashion's upper echelons, Chinese companies, including ones that have purchased established European labels, have so far found it hard to take off in Western markets. Shang Xia, founded a decade ago by Jiang Qiong Er and French luxury group Hermes International While the label is well-known in China, it has yet to achieve the broader commercial success that many in the industry had expected. ""Chinese luxury brands are still quite niche,"" Kathryn Parker, a luxury sector analyst with Jefferies, said. Shang Xia showed its commitment to Paris when it held its first fashion show on Monday on the official Paris Fashion Week schedule, sending a lineup of models in polished suits in bright colours along a circular runway. With backing from a new majority shareholder, the Agnelli family holding company Exor ?�It?�s a very bold move to do a show in Paris Fashion Week,??said Exor managing director Suzanne Heywood, who is also chairman of Shang Xia. FRENCH INFLUENCE ?�We are being watched closely,??said Isabelle Capron, international vice president at ICCF, the owner of Chinese label Icicle, noting that Chinese companies have so far had limited success in building high-end fashion businesses with an international reach. The French luxury executive was recruited in 2013 by Shouzeng Ye and Tao Xiaoma, founders of Icicle, which bought the historic French couture house Carven in 2018 and in July created the ICCF Group. Icicle, with sales of 334 million euros in 2020, up 12% from 2019, has 270 stores in 100 cities in China. The brand caters to urban professionals with earthy-toned overcoats and suits in high quality materials, often made with natural dyeing techniques. Icicle's founders chose Paris over London, New York and Milan for their investment, setting up design studios, and recruiting talent from French luxury labels. ""It?�s in Paris where you can find the talent to raise the level of the collections so that the label can reach an international level,??Capron said. LANVIN REVIVAL Fosun Fashion Group has been working to revive the historic French label Lanvin with younger, international consumers in mind, and hired Bruno Sialelli French designer from LVMH-owned Loewe label for the job. For the spring 2022 ready-to-wear runway show in Paris, the designer showed slim party dresses, worn by models in towering platform shoes with flared heels, along with an array of handbags and a new pair of futuristic sneakers ??accessories are key to the label?�s growth strategy. Supermodel Naomi Campbell closed the show, sweeping the runway with a long cape. Shang Xia executives said they are seeking to broaden their customer base among younger consumers, add new stores in Asia this year and push into the digital realm beyond China next year. ?�We are seeking new means to embrace digitalisation,??said Shang Xia founder Jiang Qiong Er, who flew in from Shanghai for the Paris show. Shang Xia?�s new creative director Yang Li said he seeks to apply Asian and Eastern design principles to the products, pointing out a bag in the collection in the shape of a triangle. ?�In our culture, when we define shapes, they?�re absolute and pure,??he said. ?�What I want to do here is to say that China is not just a market, but a creative force as well,"" Yang Li added.

Reuters' calls to the phone number were not answered on Wednesday. ""Together with the production company, we are working to resolve this matter, including editing scenes with phone numbers where necessary,"" Netflix said on Wednesday, asking fans to refrain from prank calls or messages. The woman told SBS last month that it was impossible for her to change her number due to client contacts and she had declined an offer of 1 million won ($840) in compensation.

lifestyle,Two Congos seek UNESCO listing to reclaim rumba's rhythms," KINSHASA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Perched on a corner of the stage at La Septente, an open-air club in Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, Manda Chante sings the lilting opening to ""Independence Cha Cha"", an old anthem for African anti-colonial movements. The song debuted one evening in Brussels in February 1960, during negotiations for Congo's liberation from Belgium, electrifying delegates. Within four months, Congo was free. Sixty-one years later, rumba remains at the core of African music, and a movement has emerged to cement its reputation and secure its protection. Authorities in Kinshasa and Brazzaville, the capital of neighbouring Congo Republic, have submitted a bid to add Congolese rumba to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural (UNESCO) list of intangible cultural heritage.     UNESCO will announce its decision in November. The list helps demonstrate the diversity of heritage and raises awareness about its importance. If Congolese rumba were to be added, it would join the hawker food of Singapore, sauna culture of Finland and traditional irrigation systems in the United Arab Emirates, among countless other customs on the list. ""If you look at modern rumba, we have elevated and developed it, but kept references to the icons like Le Grande Kallé,"" said Manda, referring to the stage name of Joseph Kabasele, who wrote ""Independence Cha Cha"" to persuade politicians to shelve their differences to secure self-rule. Born in the melting pot of 19th-century Cuba, rumba combined the drumming of enslaved Africans with the melodies of Spanish colonisers. Re-exported to Africa in the early 20th century on vinyl, it found a ready audience in the two Congos, who recognised the rhythms as their own. ""They took our ancestors to the Americas in the 15th or 16th century. Congolese rumba was created and embedded with the same dynamics as the story that forged this country,"" said Andre Yoka, director of the National Institute for the Arts in Kinshasa, who is leading Congo's candidacy for UNESCO status. Rumba derives from ""Nkumba"", meaning belly button in the local language, a dance that originates ""in the ancient kingdom of Kongo"", according to Congo's submission to UNESCO. ""When our ancestors who were taken abroad wanted to remember their history, their origin, their memory, they danced the navel dance,"" said Catherine Kathungu Furaha, Congo's minister of art and culture.

The head and neck of the six-metre-tall reproduction of the Renaissance statue are showcased in an octagonal structure at first-floor level while the genitalia and legs are visible at a lower level reserved for functions and select visitors. Organisers of Italy's pavilion denied suggestions in Italian media that they had deliberately tried to hide the statue's genitalia due to religious and social sensitivities in the Gulf Arab state and the predominantly Muslim region. ""We planned to position David's statue the way it is now many, many months ago,"" commissioner Paolo Glisenti said. ""We took the David statue here... at the end of April in the middle of (the holy fasting month of) Ramadan, by the way, in the presence of many high officials of the Emirati and Italian government."" Artistic director Davide Rampello said the aim was to provide a new experience by allowing visitors to see the David at eye level, whereas art lovers have to look up at the original statue at the Galleria dell'Accademia museum in Florence. ""It's good like this because we can imagine the rest,"" said   Sophie Lestrat, 44, a French national visiting the Expo. ""We don't know what we can see further down."" ""He's beautiful, a beautiful man,"" she added. 'BEAUTY CONNECTS PEOPLE' Creating the replica using one of the world's largest 3D printers involved 40 hours of digital scanning of the original 16th-century marble artwork with finishing touches completed by hand, according to the Expo website. ""The reproduction was done with very sophisticated technology used in space and finished by artisans in Florence that covered the statue in marble powder,"" Glisenti said. Based on the theme 'Beauty connects people', the Italy pavilion is among almost 200 exhibitors at Expo 2020 Dubai, the first world fair to be held in the Middle East. The fair expects to attract 25 million visits after having been delayed for a year by the coronavirus pandemic.

lifestyle,Ties and high heels out as hybrid office return sparks casual comfy boom," MADRID, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Spanish fashionista Blanca Lorca once swore by high heels and fitted clothes for the office, but the COVID-19 lockdown has transformed her style sense and shopping habits. After months working from her sleek Madrid flat, the 31-year-old pharmaceutical company employee is now dressing in neutral tones and slack fits for her three days a week in the office as a partial return gears up around the world. Eighteen months in loungewear while remote working during the pandemic have left professionals all over Europe hankering for fresh wardrobes as they embrace hybrid working. It is a boon for hard-hit retailers. The focus on comfort may have banished ties, dress shoes and high heels, but it has spurred a new desire for versatile clothing: smart enough for the office, but relaxed enough for kitchen table teleconferences. Personal apparel sales - including clothing, shoes and cosmetics - actually grew 8.5% in the 12 months leading to August, as increasing mobility and back-to-office mandates boosted shopping, according to official data. In Britain, over a quarter of people surveyed by workplace consultancy Office Group said they would continue dressing less formally even when back in the office, while almost a third plan to experiment with different styles, according to a Bank of America note. ""After being at home for so long, you prefer comfort, but at the same time you want to be stylish enough to be able to go out,"" Lorca said, wearing a light shirt and loose-cut trousers as she perused the racks in Zubi, a small boutique in Madrid. ""I look for clothes that will last over time, won't go out of fashion (and) I can use for everything."" PYJAMAS AND ZOOM Big brands are paying attention. Retailers such as Zara Many of the leading fashion brands have launched new collections for this unique back-to-work season, as easing restrictions and vaccination campaigns drive mobility. Department store El Corte Ingles, a household name in Spain, said demand for comfortable officewear surged over the summer, accelerating in September as clients returned to offices and business meetings. Shops successfully achieving pre-pandemic sales levels the fastest are those selling casual or hybrid workwear, according to analysts and fashion retail sources in London and Madrid, where Europe's high vaccination rates have helped life recover. Women whose employers mandated partial returns have kept the blouse they would sometimes have worn above pyjama bottoms for Zoom calls, but now pair it with easy trousers and flat shoes, Zubi owner Elena Zubizarreta told Reuters. Over 78% of Spaniards are fully vaccinated and around 80% of all workers have returned at least part-time, according to a survey by CCOO, the country's largest trade union. Few, however, have missed the strictures of formal dressing. Alberto Gavilan, talent director at staffing agency Addeco, said formal attire was now the exception. ""Most people will prefer the business casual code, which has proved so effective and comfortable in recent months,"" he said. 'FASHION HAS CHANGED' Over half of Spaniards who dressed formally for work pre-pandemic were enthusiastic about buying new clothes for an office return, a June survey by research company Dynata showed - the highest rate among 11 countries surveyed. The British and Japanese were the least excited, at 19% and 21% each. Spanish price comparison website Idealo.es said online searches for sport tracksuits dropped 96% from January to August as the vaccination rate increased. ""Fashion has changed and after almost two years away from the workplace you feel like having new things to go back,"" said communications specialist Valme Pardo, laying boldly-printed dresses, ample tailored trousers and stretchy blazers on her bed at her Madrid home. Men also crave comfort. Lucia Danero, a shopping adviser at El Corte Ingles in Madrid, has noticed a stream of customers looking for a refresh: but the men never ask to try on ties anymore. ""Before, it was unthinkable for a man to go to the office with a sweatshirt ... and now we're seeing it,"" she said, strolling through the aisles and pointing out the jeans businessmen now sought. 'RELAXED CITY' The trend is global. International brands Vince,??Me+Em,??Uniqlo??and ?�The White Company, as well as U.S. and UK retailers such as ?�Nordstrom??and ?�John Lewis, are dedicating ""site space to modern workwear staples, with a strong emphasis... on seasonless pieces to ensure versatility and longevity,"" trend intelligence agency Stylus said in a recent report. In fact, despite workplace mobility still sagging 30% below pre-pandemic rates, apparel sales are on average 5% higher in major Western markets, Jefferies bank said in a note to clients in September. Both physical and online sales at fashion behemoth Inditex were even 9% higher in August and the first week of September than pre-pandemic. The autumn/winter season has had a strong start, executive chairman of Inditex, Pablo Isla, told a conference, before announcing the next Massimo Dutti collection would be called ""Relaxed City"". Yet even as demand recovers, retailers are grappling with disruptions to global supply chains: sales at H&M grew less than expected in the third quarter, before being hampered in September by supply restrictions. ""There's an urge to get 'dressed up' after spending so much time at home... but we've gotten used to being comfortable and we want... garments such as unlined blazers and jackets, wider trousers and intricate knitwear,"" said Ann-Sofie Johansson, Creative Advisor at H&M. Backstage at Madrid fashion week, designers bet on new beginnings - which seemed to include bright, non-restrictive dresses and colourful jumpers. ""Heels have been left for very specific moments ... But day-to-day people have gotten rid of them, to be much more comfortable,"" said Spanish designer Maite Casademunt, whose ""Comfy Wild"" collection was dominated by dresses, smart loungewear and sports shoes. Our Standards: Private business jets once provided refuge from airport waiting lines for the few that could afford them, but the fading pandemic has driven demand to such heights that even wealthy travelers now face cancellations and delays."

""It's also not limited to one particular age group or one particular demographic group,"" he told reporters in London. ""This is really getting mainstream and broad based."" Last year, Nestle's sales from plant-based products were just 200 million Swiss francs ($216 million), a tiny fraction of its total sales of 84 billion francs. Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer said Nestle had developed the new products in less than a year, using for example its plant science expertise to engineer pea protein that did not have the taste of the legume. ""We want to be as close as possible to the animal-based version, because then it's much easier for people to switch to these type of products,"" he said in an interview. The two products will initially have a limited launch in some European markets, including Switzerland. Nestle launched its first plant-based burgers in 2019, about three years later than U.S. industry pioneers Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. ""We're the first ones to say that we did not invent the plant based hamburger, we also didn't invent plant based chicken,"" Schneider said. ""But I'm also obviously proud to say ours right now will beat everyone around the world when it comes to taste, mouth appeal and especially nutrition."" Palzer said Nestle's global reach and range of brands also gave it an advantage over high-profile rivals. ""We have a broad portfolio of food and beverage brands, which these companies don't have,"" he said. Nestle has already launched vegan products across its other categories, including a vegan KitKat. ""There's a super big opportunity for us to make line extensions is all these loved brands,"" Palzer said.

The sketch, called ""Sting Like a Bee,"" and drawn on paper in 1978 was the most sought-after work among more than 20 paintings, drawings and sketches by the former heavyweight champion that reflected Ali's interest in religion, social justice and his own career. It carried a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000. ""Ref, he did float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!"" reads the speech bubble from a boxer knocked out by an opponent whose arms are raised in victory. Ali famously used the phrase to describe his boxing style. Bonhams auctioneers said that 26 art works by Ali sold for a total of $945,524, more than three times the lower end of estimates. ""Sting Like A Bee"" was bought by a British-based collector of Ali memorabilia, Bonhams said. Other buyers were not identified. Ali's passion for art was little known but he liked to sketch as a way of unwinding after a fight or training. Some of the works for sale were traditional nature paintings, while others were more personal cartoon-like sketches. A 1979 red, white and blue painting on canvas, with the words ""I Love You America,"" sold for $150,000, while a 1967 sketch in felt pen comparing Islam to Christianity fetched $24,000. The former world heavyweight champion, who announced his conversion to Islam in 1964 after winning the title for the first time when he went by the name Cassius Clay, died in 2016 at age 74 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.

""You speak to an astronaut, they tell you they're just the tip of the iceberg. And to tell the story properly, you need to tell the story of the whole iceberg,"" Turner told Reuters. ""There's one path to success and a million paths to failure on a mission. And watching them overcome all the stages along the way is really where the drama lies."" The series marries intimate video diaries filmed by the space crews with explainers and interviews with scientists, engineers and flight controllers, offering unprecedented access to the nerve centres of the operations. NASA archives take audiences back in time to relive Cassidy's earlier expeditions, including a 2013 spacewalk with Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano which was aborted after water leaked into Parmitano's helmet, nearly causing him to drown. To Turner's surprise the scenes shot in space turned out to be the easiest part of the project. Despite ""begging and pleading"", his request to be sent to the International Space Station was turned down and he relied on his subjects to do the filming. ""When Chris said he was going to help me film the show ... that was a mission for him,"" Turner said. ""And he was going to do it amazingly."" But even Cassidy's can-do attitude nearly met its match in a series of hurdles that put at risk his eventual departure, including the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Something I've learnt through my life is to understand what piece of the jigsaw you are and what part you can play in a bigger machine,"" Turner said. ""And I hope that that's on display in our series because it's as much the technicians, the designers, just such a big team of skills who come together to make what is essentially impossible possible.""

lifestyle,Wandering dog is Istanbul commuters' best friend," ISTANBUL, Oct 6 (Reuters) - In a packed Istanbul passenger ferry between Europe and Asia, all eyes turn to one commuter enjoying the view from his window. Boji, a street dog, has become a regular sight on ferries, buses and metro trains in Europe?�s largest city. A devoted commuter, the dog enjoys long journeys on public transport, up to 30 kilometres (20 miles) on a regular week day. Istanbul municipality officials who record the dog's trips with a microchip say he drops by at least 29 metro stations a day and was even tracked at sea, taking a weekend break to the Princes' Islands off the city's coast. With golden-brown fur, dark eyes and floppy ears, Boji started to draw attention two months ago. ""We noticed a dog using our metros and trains and he knows where to go. He knows where to get out,"" said Aylin Erol, from Metro Istanbul. ""It's like he has a purpose."" Data collected from his tracking device shows historic tram lines are Boji's favourite but he is also a frequent subway commuter. Erol says the dog respects public transport rules and waits for disembarking passengers before hopping on the train. He enjoys travelling on the middle part of a subway carriage, or boji in Turkish - hence the name which officials gave him. Erol says he brought color into the lives of 1.3 million commuters of the metropolis. Istanbulites post pictures of him on social media, and his own accounts have more than 50,000 followers. ""You take the train and, suddenly, you see Boji. And look at him. He lies, just like this. You just smile and catch the moment, really. This is what Boji evokes for Istanbulites.

Born in Syria and now based in Beirut, 33-year-old visual artist Majd Abdel Hamid embroiders fabrics he collects and items he finds, from cushions to kitchen towels. At times colourful and at other times just white on white, they are designed as an abstract depiction of time and the places he has been, touching on wars, political and economic crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's been like an acceleration of traumas. It's not even one trauma that you have. It's been quite challenging to process what has happened and how can you deal with it,"" Abdel Hamid told Reuters TV. Abdel Hamid was injured in the explosion of ammonium nitrate stored at Beirut port in August 2020, with wooden fragments still stuck beneath a scar on his head. The embroidery stitches in his ""A Stitch in Times"" represent mental and physical scars. The show at an exhibition space of the Fondation d'entreprise Hermes, at the back of the Hermes store in Brussels will be the first showing of all his work. Abdel Hamid describes embroidery as a ""timeless medium"", a slow process of doing and undoing. One display piece, ""Salt of the Earth"", show threads suspended and crystallised by salt. Another shows him unthreading white bed sheets in his home. ""Embroidery is always used to celebrate the pride of a country, the pride of the family, it's about motifs.

lifestyle,"Gaza sculptor exhibits disembodied limbs, inspired by amputees' loss"," GAZA, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Palestinian artist Khaled Hussein's sculptures of human limbs are on display in a Gaza exhibition he calls ""I Miss You Very Much"", inspired by the loss felt by amputees, including victims of the conflict with Israel. ""There's a great number of amputees everywhere. It has become a phenomenon, so I wanted to work on this issue and reflect it artistically,"" Hussein, 46, told Reuters. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in 2019 there were at least 1,600 amputees among Gaza's population of two million people.Assalama Charitable Society, which cares for wounded and disabled people, said 532 Gazans had lost limbs in the conflict. Seven of Hussein's sculptures of limbs went on display this month in a Gaza art gallery. The life-sized sculptures are made from clay and then cast in other materials such as bronze or concrete, and create a haunting image in the small gallery space. One shows two legs standing side by side, the big toe of one curled gently over the other foot. Another shows a naked foot poking out from under a rug lain over a calf. A leg depicted beside a mirror is a reference to a therapy technique that uses vision to treat pain amputees can feel in their missing limbs. Hussein's work is intended in part to draw attention to the suffering of those injured in protests in 2018 and 2019 at Gaza's border with Israel, which imposes tight restrictions on the territory run by the Islamist Hamas militant group. Palestinian health officials said at least 200 people were killed and thousands wounded by Israeli forces in the demonstrations. U.N. investigators said more than 120 people had a limb amputated. Israel said its troops opened fire to protect the border from incursions and attacks by armed militants. But the work explores the loss of a limb regardless of the cause. One of his sculptures depicts the left leg that Ahmed Abu Daqen, 21, lost in a car accident as a child. ""I didn't expect that someone would take what I had lost as an inspiration and turn it into an artwork that documents it to the world,"" said Abu Daqen, who plays on an amputees' soccer team.

lifestyle,Russian actor blasts off to attempt a world first: a movie in space," MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Russian actress and a film director blasted off for the International Space Station on Tuesday, beating Tom Cruise in the race to shoot the first movie in space. The Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft is set to dock at 1212 GMT at the station, which orbits Earth at an altitude of around 220 miles (354 km). Russian state media provided blanket and patriotic coverage in the run-up, with a countdown clock running on Channel One and news anchors framing the development as a significant breakthrough by Russia that the rest of the world is watching closely. The launch to film the movie ""The challenge"" puts Russia on course to beat the United States in the latest chapter of the space race. Actress Yulia Peresild and director Klim Shipenko will reach the cosmos ahead of Cruise, whose plans to blast off on a SpaceX rocket for an as-yet-untitled Hollywood film were announced by NASA last year. Russia's own space industry has in recent years been dogged by delays, accidents and corruption scandals, while U.S.-based private firms backed by rich businessmen such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have developed new spaceships. Peresild and Shipenko were accompanied at the launch of their 12-day mission by two Russian cosmonauts. Russian competition with the United States in space was a hallmark of the Cold War. Moscow launched the first satellite and put the first man and woman in space, but NASA beat it to the Moon landing. More recently, they have cooperated aboard the ISS, where cosmonauts and astronauts have lived side by side for decades. ""Space is where we became pioneers and we still maintain a confident lead despite everything,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after the launch. ""Yes, others are stepping on (our) toes but it is obvious that there is competition in a good sense. For our country, a flight like this, that popularises our achievements and the theme of space in general, is good news."" In the film, Peresild plays a doctor who is asked to travel to the space station to save a cosmonaut's life. Cosmonaut crew members are also set to appear. Director Klim Shipenko, whose height of 1.9 metres (6 feet 2 inches) makes the flight in a small capsule especially challenging, has already said he is looking forward to a Mars-based sequel.

lifestyle,Private collection tells story of Egypt's cinematic heyday," ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Oct 4 (Reuters) - In a small apartment-turned-museum in the northern city of Alexandria, 72-year-old Makram Salama's cluttered collection of negatives, posters and projectors traces the history of Egyptian cinema through its 20th century heyday. The collection started with photos and posters from his hometown in southern Egypt where he worked in a sugar cane factory, and grew to include thousands of items picked up from production companies and others who abandoned them as they switched to digital film. Items include 50 vintage cinema projectors and a rare poster from the 1932 film ""The Egyptian Author"" which Salama says is thought to be one of the country's oldest. The Egyptian film industry flourished midway through the last century, when it was one of the world's largest and nurtured Omar Sharif, who went on to become a global star. It later faded, amid domestic political upheavals and competition from elsewhere in the Arab region. Salama said he was worried about the fate of his treasured possessions. His two sons live abroad and have little interest in taking on a collection in which he invested his earnings after moving to Suez and establishing a marine services firm. Some items he expects to sell. Others he will keep aside, because he considers them of national importance. ""I have negatives for (late president Gamal) Abdel Nasser. Would I sell Abdel Nasser's negatives?"" he asked. Meanwhile many of the cinemas that used to dot the country, from provincial towns to oil firm compounds in the desert, have disappeared. ""All of this is now gone. I'm sad, really sad. Cinema used to be the second most important product for the country after cotton,"" Salama said. As of 2018, Egypt had 78 cinemas, mostly in greater Cairo and Alexandria, down from 110 in 2010, according to the annual cultural survey released by the country's official statistics agency, CAPMAS.

lifestyle,"Box Office: 'Venom' Sequel Feasts on Monstrous $90 Million Debut, Setting Pandemic Record"," LOS ANGELES, Oct 3 (Variety.com) - ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" roared to $90.1 million in its debut, setting a new pandemic record. It's an impressive result, one that provides a lifeline to struggling movie theaters and (once again) proves Marvel's might at the box office. The much darker ""Venom"" follow-up comes from Sony Pictures and is separate from Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe, which recently delivered ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and ""Black Widow"" -- the two highest-grossing films of the year at the domestic box office. If its first three days in theaters are any indication, ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" looks to find itself among that group as 2021's biggest earners. The film is playing only in cinemas as opposed to a hybrid release on-demand, a factor that should help ticket sales. ""We are also pleased that patience and theatrical exclusivity have been rewarded with record results,"" Sony's chairman Tom Rothman said in a statement to press. ""With apologies to Mr. Twain: The death of movies has been greatly exaggerated."" The supervillain sequel, starring Tom Hardy as the otherworldly lethal protector, blew past the pandemic-era benchmark set last July by ""Black Widow,"" which opened to $80 million in theaters. It made an additional $60 million on Disney Plus, where it was available to purchase on the same day as its theatrical debut. ""Young adult audiences are less deterred by current pandemic conditions than older and family moviegoers, which is benefitting superhero, action and horror movies,"" says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. He adds: ""For these movies, playing exclusively on the big screen is clearly an advantage."" Making inaugural ticket sales for ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" even more impressive: It had a bigger opening weekend than its predecessor, 2018's ""Venom."" The first comic book adventure with Hardy at the helm opened to $80 million, years before the devastating global health crisis. Despite terrible reviews, the original became a box office juggernaut and grossed $213 million in North America and $856 million globally. ""Venom"" was particularly huge in China, where the 2018 movie collected $269 million. The sequel doesn't have a release date yet in China, a market that will be crucial to its success. Though it is expected to open there, the country has denied ""Black Widow,"" ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and other major Hollywood titles. ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" wasn't the only new movie to inject some life into the box office. MGM's animated adventure ""The Addams Family 2"" pulled in a better-than-expected $18 million from 4,207 theaters while it was simultaneously available to rent on-demand. Meanwhile, the Warner Bros. movie ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" a prequel to ""The Sopranos,"" flopped in its debut, generating a paltry $5 million from 3,181 venues. Like the studio's entire 2021 slate, the film opened concurrently on HBO Max at no extra cost to subscribers. Elsewhere at the domestic box office, ""Shang-Chi"" collected $6 million in its fifth weekend of release, boosting its overall total to $206 million. It's the first, and so far only, pandemic-era movie to gross more than $200 million in the U.S. and Canada. The superhero tentpole has generated $386 million globally, which is far less than a Marvel movie would make in non-COVID times but ranks as one of the best hauls at a time when attendance hasn't come close to reaching pre-pandemic levels.

lifestyle,Belgian Holocaust survivor acts out his story on stage to mark 90th birthday," BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (Reuters) - In a rundown old factory in Belgium, Holocaust survivor Simon Gronowski celebrated his upcoming 90th birthday on Sunday by starring in an opera inspired by his life - a history of love, faith and forgiveness overcoming the darkest tragedy. Gronowski was 11 years old and living Brussels when in 1943 Nazis put him, his mother and sister on a train bound for Auschwitz, the infamous death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. The train was briefly stopped by three Belgian resistance fighters in Boortmeerbeek, 30 kilometres (19 miles) northeast of Brussels. In the ensuing chaos, Gronowski jumped off. He went on to survive World War Two in hiding. His family perished at Auschwitz, where more than 1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed. ""I am here because of a miracle. I jumped out of a death convoy,"" said Gronowski. ""I was very unhappy when I was 14, 15, 20 years old. I cried a lot. But I never had hate. For me, hate is an illness. That I never had."" Having been a much-loved child gave Gronowski the strength to overcome his tragedy, he said. In honour of his cherished sister, who was good at classical music and loved jazz, he became a jazz pianist, on top of his career as a lawyer. After keeping quiet for decades about his past, Gronowski decided in the 2000s to write a memoir. That led to a meeting in 2012 with Koenraad Tinel, the son of Flemish Nazis whose brother had served as the prison guard of Gronowski's family. Tinel, a sculptor three years younger than Gronowski, asked for forgiveness. ""The children of the Nazis are not guilty,"" Gronowski recounted telling Tinel. ""He had the guilt of his father on his shoulders, he felt guilty. These words I said were important to him because they came from a victim of the Nazis."" ""Our pain is not the same. But I understood his pain. And now he is more than a friend. He is my brother."" ODE TO LOVE Nearly 80 years since the fateful events, Gronowski's back is hunched with age and he can't stand for long. But his vivid eyes, quick smile and gestures give him the air of someone much younger as he talks of his life marked by the horrors of the Holocaust, which has also been turned into an ode to love of humanity. British composer Howard Moody was so inspired by Gronowski's story after meeting him at a theatre performance several years ago that he wrote an opera based on Gronowski's life and his extraordinary friendship with Tenel. The opera, ""PUSH"", has been performed several times in Belgium and the UK, but to mark Gronowski's 90th birthday on Oct. 12, Moody put on a special performance on Sunday in which both Gronowski and Tenel appeared, playing themselves. The performance was staged in an old furniture factory near Boortmeerbeek, where Gronowski jumped off the train nearly 80 ears ago, to a rapturous reception from an audience of 300. PUSH mixes classic arias with jazz inserts and choral singing. In one grand scene set on the deck of a train carriage, the choir - collectively impersonating Gronowski's mother - pushes little Simon off the convoy. ""That's not something to be light or easy about. One has to give a sense of awareness about what happened and why it happened,"" said Moody.

lifestyle,Seller basks in 'Squid Game' fame of his 'sweet and deadly' treat," SEOUL, Oct 1 (Reuters) - A South Korean sweet featured as one of the lethal challenges in the Netflix The series has become a viral hit by depicting childhood games with deadly consequences. One of the challenges has the cash-strapped contestants on the show carving out the symbol etched into a brittle sugar candy called dalgona without cracking the whole piece or risk being shot by masked enforcers. Dalgona is typically sold with a variety of shapes but ""Squid Game"" featured four, a triangle, circle, star, and an umbrella. One piece is about 2,000 won ($1.68) but you can get a buy-one, get-one-free deal if you don't crack the first one. An Yong-hui, 37, has been making dalgona for the past eight years in a university district in the capital Seoul. He and his co-workers used 15 kg (33 lb) of sugar to make 700 candies for the filming in June 2020 of the show's third episode, which is described by Netflix as equal parts ""sweet and deadly"". As the show's popularity has surged since its premiere last month, An hasn't been able to go home for a week in order to meet the demand from eager ""Squid Game"" fans that start queuing up outside his 2-square-metre (2.4 square yards) street kitchen at 11 a.m. He now sells more than 500 dalgonas a day, from less than 200 before the show's premiere. ""We are thinking we should place a rifle here as well,"" An said, chuckling at his reference to the show's outsized repercussions for failure. On the show, the downtrodden contestants vie for a prize of 45.6 billion won ($38.40 million) by competing in games that recall a more idyllic pre-digital time. Netflix said in an article on the show's creation that director Hwang Dong-hyuk's selection of childhood games was deliberate to make the show more relatable to the audience. For South Koreans, dalgona sellers were a fixture in front of schools until the early 2000s but the trend has died down since then and, according to An, the candy is even older. VIRAL EXPLOSION ""I have heard so much about the dalgona challenge from my dad and grandma and was always curious,"" said Lee You-hee, a university freshman in Seoul. ""It was my first time trying and was shocked at how easily it breaks!"" she said, after failing the challenge while standing near An's stand. In line with the show's viral explosion, international viewers are posting their efforts at making dalgona and passing the challenge on video-sharing platform TikTok and other social media. Even e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon In Singapore, the Brown Butter Cafe was the latest business to tap the Squid Game hype and the drama of the dalgona challenge. Sitting with brows furrowed and an intense look of concentration, Squid Game fan Wang Chen, 32, picked away unsuccessfully at his delicate dalgona candy. His failure on Friday would have meant certain death in Squid Game. But in the Brown Butter Cafe, it just means missing out on a prize. ""I almost made it ... if you're so strict as in the real TV show, then I'm gone,"" Wang said. Wang looked over at friend Zhang Qi's attempt. ""This is a disaster.

I'd much sooner be here than in a centrally heated house."" For Gardner, who moved with his wife Janet from suburban England to a remote corner of the Scottish highlands at the age of 50, climbing mountains has become more than just a boyhood dream. Two years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2018 Janet, a former teacher who also suffers from osteoporosis, became so ill she needed 24-hour care. Gardner was devastated, and decided he needed a challenge to help him cope. ""When it got too much for me to handle, when she went into hospital and care ... I just didn't know what to do. We've been used to each other's company all 24/7 for 30 years. And then suddenly it's gone,"" he said. ""Doing this climbing has enabled me to refocus to some extent. I had to find something of this type, otherwise I'd have had ... mental health problems. I know that."" The task he set himself would challenge many half his age - to climb all 282 of Scotland's ""Munros"", or mountains above 3,000 ft, in 1,200 days. He has completed 177 so far. In honour of Janet, he is raising money for the charities Alzheimer Scotland and the Royal Osteoporosis Society.

lifestyle,Descendant of tsars becomes first royal to marry in Russia since revolution," ST PETERSBURG, Russia, Oct 1 (Reuters) - A descendant of Russia's former imperial family married his Italian bride on Friday in the first royal wedding to take place on Russian soil since tsarist times more than a century ago. Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov tied the knot with Victoria Romanovna Bettarini, an Italian, at St. Isaac's Cathedral in Russia's former imperial capital St Petersburg. Russian Orthodox clergy conducted the elaborate ceremony, watched by hundreds of guests who included the groom's mother, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia - the self-proclaimed heir to Russia's imperial throne - and more than a dozen minor European royals. George Mikhailovich's great-grandfather, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, fled Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, escaping first to Finland and later relocating with his family to Western Europe. Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, his wife and five children were murdered by a revolutionary firing squad in July, 1918, in the cellar of a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg, a city 1,450 km (900 miles) east of Moscow. George Mikhailovich, 40, was born in Madrid and has lived most of his life in Spain and France. Bettarini, 39, who converted to the Russian Orthodox faith last year and took the name Victoria Romanovna, was led to the altar by her father, Roberto Bettarini, who has served in the Italian diplomatic service. George Mikhailovich visited Russia for the first time in 1992 and moved to Moscow in 2019, where he works on a number of charity projects. The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia for over 300 years before Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, setting the country on course for the Bolshevik Revolution in November of that year, civil war and 70 years of Communist rule.

lifestyle,'No Time To Die' for British cinemas banking on Bond boost," Oct 1 (Reuters) - British cinema chains will enjoy the luxury of full houses this weekend thanks to the enduring allure of the James Bond franchise, but their challenge is to make movie-going a habit again after the coronavirus pandemic. ""No Time To Die"", the new Bond film, is perhaps a fitting title for an industry that has been battered by the closures of cinemas around the globe to try to contain the deadly virus. Theatres are now reopening in many countries but streaming services such as Netflix Tim Richards, founder and head of cinema chain Vue, says  going out to see a film enhances its value. ""Enjoying a movie with friends, family, strangers makes it  funnier, scarier, whatever it might be,"" he told Reuters. Richards points to a strong slate of film releases this autumn to help maintain the momentum -- including historical drama ""The Last Duel"", biographical crime movie ""House of Gucci,"" as well as superhero movies such as ""Eternals"" and the latest instalments in the ""Superman"" and ""Venom"" series. His enthusiasm is shared by Jon Dixon, UK Marketing Director at Showcase Cinemas. ""There is actually an awful lot of content coming down to be released through the rest of 2021 and 2022... When you look at the release calendar for the final quarter of this year and then into next year, it is a phenomenal lineup,"" Dixon said. CRAIG BOWS OUT There are brighter signs for cinemas across the Atlantic. Disney's most recent film, Marvel's ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" set a Labor Day weekend record with $94.7 million in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian theatres. Disney will release ""Eternals,"" ""West Side Story"" and the rest of its 2021 films exclusively in theatres before sending them to streaming, a show of confidence that moviegoing will rebound. ""What Bond is showing, and films that have been released over the past few months like Shang-Chi, is that when films are released exclusively in cinema before they have home entertainment or streaming releases then the demand is there for people to see these films in the cinema,"" said Dixon.

The 49-year-old, who also announced a new album release, will perform next June at Knebworth Park in Hertfordshire, north of London, with singer Michael Kiwanuka and bands Kasabian, Goat Girl and Fat White Family opening the stage. Gallagher used to front Oasis with his brother Noel.

lifestyle,Disney resolves dispute with Scarlett Johansson over 'Black Widow' movie," LOS ANGELES, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Terms of the settlement between Disney and Johansson's Periwinkle Entertainment company were not disclosed. Johansson, 36, sued Disney in July, accusing the entertainment giant of breaching her contract when the company offered the movie on its subscription streaming service Disney+ at the same time the film was playing in theaters. Her complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, argued that the dual-release strategy for ""Black Widow"" had reduced her compensation, which she said was to be based in part on box office receipts from an exclusive run in cinemas. Disney had countered at the time that there was ""no merit"" to the lawsuit and asserted that the studio had complied with terms of Johansson's contract. The company also said then that Johansson's lawsuit demonstrated a ""callous disregard"" for the risks to movie audiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The dispute was closely watched for possible ramifications in Hollywood as media companies seek to build their streaming services by offering premium content to lure in subscribers. ""Black Widow,"" which debuted on July 9 in theaters and for a $30 charge on Disney+, has grossed more than $378 million in worldwide theater receipts, according to film tracking service Box Office Mojo. The feature also generated about $60 million through streaming purchases in its first 20 days in release, Disney has said. Johansson starred as fictional Russian assassin-turned-Avenger superhero, a role she has played in nine Marvel films. ""I'm very pleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement with Scarlett Johansson regarding 'Black Widow,'"" Alan Bergman, content chairman for Disney Studios, said in a statement on Thursday.

lifestyle,Nobel Medicine Prize for COVID-19 vaccine? It may be too soon," STOCKHOLM, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Scientists behind COVID-19 vaccines could be in the running to win the Nobel Prize for Medicine even though the pandemic is far from over. Some scientists say it is just a matter of time: If the work that went into developing the vaccines is not recognised when this year's prize is announced on Monday, it will win the award in years to come. More than 4.7 million people have died from COVID-19 since the first cases of the novel coronavirus were registered in 2019, and many countries still live under severe restrictions intended to curb its spread. But COVID-19 vaccines have helped some wealthy states  return almost to normality while others are yet to receive vaccine doses in large quantities. Among those seen by other scientists as potential winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine are Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko and American Drew Weissman for their work on what are known as Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna ""This technique will get the prize sooner or later, of that I am sure,"" said Ali Mirazami, professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. ""The question is when."" Traditional vaccines, which introduce a weakened or dead virus to stimulate the body's immune system, can take a decade or more to develop. Moderna's mRNA vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days. The mRNA carries messages from the body's DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes including digestion or fighting disease. The new vaccines use laboratory-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus' spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus. DECADES OF WORK The mRNA was discovered in 1961 but it has taken scientists decades to cure the mRNA technique from problems such as instability and causing inflammatory conditions. Developers now hope it can be used to treat both cancer and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in the future. ""In addition to the fact that they have been shown to generate a very effective immune response, you do not have to tailor the production every time you make a new vaccine,"" said Adam Frederik Sander Bertelsen, Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen and chief scientific officer at vaccine company Adaptvac. ""It has actually saved countless thousands of people due to its speed and efficiency, so I can well support that.""
Kariko, 66, laid the groundwork for the mRNA vaccines and Weissman, 62, is her long-time collaborator. L1N2I2315 ""They are the brain behind the mRNA discovery,"" said Mirazami. He added: ""They might be too young, the (Nobel) committee usually wait until the recipients are in their 80s."" Kariko, with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, made a breakthrough by figuring out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive. The Nobel Prize was founded by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel and is awarded for achievements in Medicine, Chemistry, Literature, Peace and Physics. This year's winners are announced between Oct. 4 and 11, starting with Medicine.

lifestyle,"Overcoming criticism, Japanese princess set to marry on October 26"," TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Japanese Princess Mako will marry her fiance, a former college classmate, on October 26, authorities said Friday, after years of intense scrutiny and criticism that cast her engagement in an unflattering light. The 29-year-old niece of Emperor Naruhito became engaged to Kei Komuro, 29, in 2017, and the two initially captivated the public with their smiles at each other in a news conference to announce the event. But tabloid reports soon emerged about a financial dispute between Komuro's mother and her former fiance, and early in 2018 the marriage was postponed. In August that year Komuro departed to attend law school in the United States, and didn't return until Monday. The Imperial Household Agency, which runs the lives of the royal family, made the announcement of the wedding date at a news conference. They also said the princess is suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Kyodo news agency reported - echoing the situation of Empress Masako, who for years has struggled with what has been termed an ""adjustment disorder."" Mako will leave the royal family upon her marriage, as is customary. None of the ceremonies that usually accompany a royal marriage will take place, and the princess will forgo a one-off payment of a million dollars to which she is entitled, media reports have said. The couple will register their marriage at a local government office, with records of the imperial family adjusted to reflect that Princess Mako has left it, reports have said. The controversy over the pair's marriage started when a tabloid reported claims by a former fiance of Komuro's mother that the mother and son had failed to repay a debt of about $35,000. Komuro has said his mother's former fiancé provided the money as a gift, not a loan. The scandal spread from tabloids to regular news media and gained still more life when imperial family members were prompted to speak out. Komuro himself issued a detailed statement this year. Komuro completed studies at Fordham Law School this year and took the bar exam that will enable him to practice law this summer. He has secured a job as a clerk in a law office in the United States, according to media reports. He flew into Tokyo late on Monday for his first visit in three years, sporting a ponytail that set off widespread tabloid and television discussion about whether he was being disrespectful. A recent poll by the daily Mainichi showed 38% of respondents supported the marriage, while 35% opposed it, and 26% expressed no interest.

lifestyle,Nobel Peace Prize: Is this Greta Thunberg's year?," OSLO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced just three weeks before world leaders gather for a climate summit that scientists say could determine the future of the planet, one reason why prize watchers say this could be the year of Greta Thunberg. The world's most prestigious political accolade will be unveiled on Oct. 8. While the winner often seems a total surprise, those who follow it closely say the best way to guess is to look at the global issues most likely to be on the minds of the five committee members who choose. With the COP26 climate summit set for the start of November in Scotland, that issue could be global warming. Scientists paint this summit as the last chance to set binding targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for the next decade, vital if the world is to have hope of keeping temperature change below the 1.5 degree Celsius target to avert catastrophe. That could point to Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, who at 18 would be the second youngest winner in history by a few months, after Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai. ""The committee often wants to send a message. And this will be a strong message to send to COP26, which will be happening between the announcement of the award and the ceremony,"" Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, told Reuters. Another big issue the committee may want to address is democracy and free speech. That could mean an award for a press freedom group, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists or Reporters Without Borders, or for a prominent political dissident, such as exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya or jailed Russian activist Alexei Navalny. A win for a journalism advocacy group would resonate ""with the large debate about the importance of independent reporting and the fighting of fake news for democratic governance,"" said Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. A Nobel for either Navalny or Tsikhanouskaya would be an echo of the Cold War, when peace and literature prizes were bestowed on prominent Soviet dissidents such as Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Oddsmakers also tip groups such as the World Health Organization or the vaccine sharing body COVAX, which are directly involved in the global battle against COVID-19. But prize watchers say this could be less likely than might be assumed: the committee already cited the pandemic response last year, when it chose the U.N. World Food Programme. While parliamentarians from any country can nominate candidates for the prize, in recent years the winner has tended to be a nominee proposed by lawmakers from Norway, whose parliament appoints the prize committee. Norwegian lawmakers surveyed by Reuters have included Thunberg, Navalny, Tsikhanouskaya and the WHO on their lists. SECRETS OF THE VAULT The committee's full deliberations remain forever secret, with no minutes taken of discussions. But other documents, including this year's full list of 329 nominees, are kept behind an alarmed door protected by several locks at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, to be made public in 50 years. Inside the vault, document folders line the walls: green for nominations, blue for correspondence. It is a trove for historians seeking to understand how laureates emerge. The most recent documents made public are about the 1971 prize, won by Willy Brandt, chancellor of West Germany, for his moves to reduce East-West tension during the Cold War. ""The Europe you see today is basically the legacy of those efforts,"" librarian Bjoern Vangen told Reuters. The documents reveal that one of the main finalists Brandt beat out for the prize was French diplomat Jean Monnet, a founder of the European Union. It would take another 41 years for Monnet's creation, the EU, to finally win the prize in 2012.

lifestyle,"Nigerian artist says British Museum accepts his gift, keeps looted bronzes"," LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - An artist from Benin City in Nigeria said the British Museum had accepted his gift of a bronze plaque in what he felt was a possible first step towards the museum's return of the priceless Benin Bronzes that were looted by British troops in 1897. However, the museum told him an exchange of new for looted artworks was impossible, he said. Osarobo Zeickner-Okoro, a founding member of Ahiamwen, a new guild of Benin City bronze casters and artists, had offered his creation to encourage the museum to give back the sculptures but also to demand acknowledgment of the city's modern-day culture. After meeting with two curators from the museum's Africa department, he told Reuters on Thursday they had accepted his gift and expressed an interest in acquiring several works by other Ahiamwen artists. The museum said it was grateful for the meeting with Zeickner-Okoro but: ""At this stage, there have been no formal discussions about acquiring these objects for the collection."" Zeickner-Okoro said he was delighted that his gift, a 2-metre-by-2-metre plaque with carvings depicting historical events in Benin City, had been accepted even though the museum ruled out an exchange. ""It's disappointing but this is the first step,"" he said. Created from brass and bronze in the once mighty Kingdom of Benin from at least the 16th century onwards, the Benin Bronzes are among Africa's most culturally significant artefacts. European museums that house them have faced years of criticism because of their status as loot and symbols of colonial greed. ""Part of the crime that's been committed is that Benin has been portrayed as this dead civilisation,"" said Zeickner-Okoro. ""The reparation is not just returning the Bronzes. It's also acknowledging us, that we're a living civilisation."" He said the acceptance of his plaque and proposed acquisition of other works, including a life-size ram made from spark plugs by Kelly Omodamwen and some Benin women's heads by Andrew Edjobeguo, went a long way towards righting that wrong.

lifestyle,Factbox: How does the Nobel Peace Prize work?," OSLO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The winner of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Oct. 8 in Oslo. Here is a look at how the award works: WHO CAN WIN? The prize should go to the person ""who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses"", according to the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, who founded the awards. Thousands of people can propose names: members of governments and parliaments; current heads of state; university professors of history, social sciences, law and philosophy; and former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others. This year there are 329 nominees, although the full list will be kept locked away in a vault for 50 years. Among oddsmakers' favourites this year are Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and the World Health Organization. WHO DECIDES? The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Norwegian parliament. Members are often retired politicians, but not always. The current committee is led by a lawyer and includes one academic. They are all put forward by Norwegian political parties and their appointments reflect the balance of power in Norway's parliament. HOW DO THEY DECIDE? Nominations close on Jan. 31. Members of the committee can make their own nominations no later than at the first meeting of the committee in February. They discuss all the nominations, then establish a shortlist. Each nominee is then assessed and examined by a group of permanent advisers and other experts. The committee meets roughly once a month to discuss the nominations. They usually make their decision at the final committee meeting, which tends to be at the beginning of October. The committee seeks a consensus on its selection. If it can't, the decision is reached by majority vote. The last time a member quit in protest was in 1994, when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the prize with Israel's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. WHO IS NOMINATED? While the full list of nominations is kept secret, nominators are free to disclose them. In recent years, Norway's own lawmakers have tended to release names of their nominees in advance, with a run of success: six of the last seven winners appeared on those lists. This year Organisations nominated include Black Lives Matter, the World Health Organization, the COVAX vaccine sharing body, and press freedom groups Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists. WHAT DOES THE LAUREATE GET? A medal, a diploma, ten million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million) - and immediate global attention. South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 laureate, has said becoming a Nobel laureate was a double-edged sword. ""One day no one was listening. The next, I was an oracle,"" he is quoted as saying in his authorised biography. WILL COVID-19 CANCEL THE CEREMONY? The ceremony will take place on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. Since 1989 it has been held at the Oslo City Hall, but it was cancelled last year due to coronavirus restrictions. The Norwegian Nobel Institute will say in mid-October whether there will be a ceremony in Oslo this year.

lifestyle,Drawings by boxing legend Muhammad Ali up for auction," NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A rare collection of sketches and paintings by American boxer Muhammad Ali - who loved to draw between fights - is going up for auction in New York next week. The 24-piece collection, many of them in cartoon style and some of them signed, reflect Ali's interest in religion and social justice, but there are also some that picture him in the ring. ""Ref, he did float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!"" reads the speech bubble from a boxer knocked out by an opponent with his arms raised in victory. The painting, called ""Sting Like a Bee,"" was made by Ali in 1978 during the filming of the historical mini series ""Freedom Road"" in which he starred, Bonhams auctioneers said. It is expected to fetch $40,000 - $60,000 at the sale on Oct. 5. Bonhams said Ali's passion for drawing was little known, but he liked to sketch as a way of unwinding after a fight or training. ""A lot of people are excited because no one knew he was an artist and no one knew about this treasure trove of artwork. So we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of excitement,"" said Helen Hall, director of popular culture at Bonhams. The works for sale come from the collection of Rodney Hilton Brown, who worked with Ali on his art. The former world heavyweight champion, who announced his conversion to Islam in 1964 at the height of his career, died in 2016 at age 74 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease. ""The Starving Children of Mississippi,"" from 1967, shows a figure in shorts saying ""I only wanted to fight to help feed you poor Black kids."" ""There's one that references the race riots in L.A. and Newark in '65 and '67,"" said Hall. ""One of the paintings is devoted to Islam. He had just recently converted. And then some of them have a lighter tone and relate to boxing."" Other works include ""America: The Big Jail"" from 1967, and ""War in America"" which has a pre-sale estimate of $25,000 to $35,000.

LA Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny ""Respectfully, the court was wrong to suspend Mr. Spears, put a stranger in his place to manage Britney?�s estate, and extend the very conservatorship that Britney begged the court to terminate earlier this summer,"" Vivian Thoreen, a lawyer for Jamie Spears, said in a statement. The outcome was ""disappointing, and frankly, a loss for Britney Spears,"" Thoreen said. The ""Stronger"" singer previously told the court that her father was controlling and that she was afraid of him. After he was suspended, the pop star said that she was ""on cloud 9 right now."" Thoreen, however, said Jamie Spears had helped the singer revive her career and re-establish a relationship with her children under the conservatorship, which has governed her personal and financial affairs since she had a mental health breakdown in 2008. Details of the singer's mental health have not been publicly disclosed. ""For anyone who has tried to help a family member dealing with mental health issues, they can appreciate the tremendous amount of daily worry and work this required,"" Thoreen said. ""For Mr. Spears, this also meant biting his tongue and not responding to all the false, speculative, and unsubstantiated attacks on him by certain members of the public, media, or more recently, Britney?�s own attorney,"" she added.

The ""Number One"" guitar, the earliest approved production model of the famed Gibson Les Paul electric guitar, is being sold by his son Gene. It is estimated to be worth between $100,000 and $150,000, Christie's says. ""I'd have to say, what's the Wright brother's first plane worth? What's Thomas Edison's first light bulb worth? The Paul guitar, the Les Paul Number One, was his crowning achievement,"" Gene said on Thursday. As acoustic guitars were losing their dominance, Gibson and Les Paul got together in the early 1950s to come up with a solid-body electric guitar. The instrument he produced became one of the most iconic electric guitars, played by the likes of Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck and Duane Allman. ""And what rock and roll guitarists in the early '60s realized is that this is a perfect rock and roll machine,"" Gene Paul said. ""It's an instrument that can be turned up to its full volume, plugged into a 100-Watt amp stack amplifier.

lifestyle,Exiled painter depicts 'slow disappearance' of Afghan women under Taliban," BUDAPEST, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Murad Sharifi, a refugee from Afghanistan, works at a kebab place and lives in a shelter for the homeless in Budapest's outskirts. His tiny room is filled with dozens of paintings depicting a colourful but ominous world, of Afghan women clad in long black burqa gowns, surrounded by hostile men. Sharifi, who fled to Hungary during the 2015 migration wave with tens of thousands of other asylum-seekers, says it is his ""obligation"" to show the oppression faced by women in his home country, worsening since the Taliban takeover in August. He was drawn to paint ""to express women's pain, and my own feelings"", he said in his bare-walled room, where his canvasses jostle for space with two small beds, two chairs and a table. Some of his more joyful works depict couples among leafy trees. But most feature starker scenes. In one, which he describes as an illustration of women's oppression, a woman is shown in a meat grinder with a bearded man squeezing her neck and pushing her down. In another, a woman, with her long hair freely floating, has faces of men running down the side of her green robe and a queue of them eyeing her suspiciously. ""In a country where men rule over women, women are deprived of their right to speak freely,"" he says. Under the Taliban, who took power in August, he expects women will slowly ""disappear"" behind the walls of their homes, as they were forced to do when the Taliban last ruled 20 years ago and banned them from work and school. While the Taliban have promised to allow women more freedoms this time, they have so far reopened schools and most workplaces only to men and boys. Sharifi is from the mainly Shi'ite Muslim Hazara community, which was repressed under the severe Sunni rule of the Taliban. He arrived in Hungary with the massive wave of hundreds of thousands of migrants that entered Europe in 2015. His paintings are now exhibited at a hall in Budapest along with artwork of three other refugees. Refugees often deal with traumas through artwork, and seeing their paintings could have a ""therapeutic"" influence on the public, too, said Marta Pardavi, Co-chair of the Helsinki Committee, an NGO that helped organise the exhibition. ""Because this artwork can convey the traumas, and can make them far more understandable,"" she said.

lifestyle,Public inquiry into London Grenfell fire turned into play," LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - In a rehearsal room in west London, actor Derek Elroy delivers a powerful monologue about the devastating 2017 fire at Grenfell Tower, a social housing block just a short distance away. In the role of barrister Leslie Thomas, Elroy's lines are taken from the public inquiry into the blaze which killed 72 people on the night of June 14, 2017. ""The Grenfell fire did not happen in a vacuum. This was not simply a local tragedy for west London. It had and has national and global ramifications,"" Elroy tells the other actors on the makeshift set playing various parties in the inquiry. ""Those who were affected come from a cultural, racially ethnically, religiously and economically diverse group. This disaster happened within a pocket of one of the smallest yet richest boroughs in London."" Play ""Value Engineering: Scenes From the Grenfell Inquiry"" is based on words of those involved in the public Grenfell Tower Inquiry, set up in the aftermath of Britain's deadliest domestic fire in a generation. Following the blaze, Prime Minister Theresa May ordered the inquiry led by retired judge Martin Moore-Bick. Phase 1, which looked at what happened on the night of the fire, concluded in December 2018. The play is based verbatim on the ongoing Phase 2, which examines the cause of the fire, including the building's refurbishment and condition which allowed it to quickly turn into an inferno. ""We're concentrating more on the story people know less about, the story of the botched refurbishment and obviously the story which has become of huge prominence with the public these days is the story about the cladding materials that were used,"" director Nicolas Kent told Reuters. The dangerous combustible cladding used on the residential block was identified as central to the fire's quick spread, and has since been found on buildings across Britain, calling for expensive removal or round-the-clock fire watches. The play, a not-for-profit production, will show at London's Tabernacle theatre from Oct. 13 -Nov. 13, before moving to the Birmingham Repertory theatre for a Nov. 16 - Nov. 20 run. ""It's got a broader significance,"" said journalist and playwright Richard Norton-Taylor, who edited the transcripts and has worked with Kent on other verbatim inquiry plays before.

Russia's last tsar Nicholas II, his wife and five children were killed by a revolutionary firing squad in July 1918 in the cellar of a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg, a city 1,450 km (900 miles) east of Moscow. ""This was the first place in Russia to which we returned,"" George Mikhailovich, 40, told news website Fontanka.ru about the choice of St. Petersburg for his wedding. ""This is very, very close to the family."" George Mikhailovich was born in Spain to Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia - the self-proclaimed heir to Russia's imperial throne - and her husband Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich of Russia. He lived in France and Spain for most of his life. His great-grandfather, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, managed to escape Bolshevik violence during the 1917 revolution to Finland. He and his family later relocated to Western Europe. George Mikhailovich visited Russia for the first time in 1992, and now lives in Moscow where he works on a number of charity projects. Bettarini, 39, converted to the Russian Orthodox faith last year and took the name Victoria Romanovna. The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia for 300 years before Nicholas II abdicated in 1917, setting Russia on course for the Bolshevik Revolution, civil war and 70 years of Communist rule.

lifestyle,"Ahead of winter hibernation, Alaska celebrates Fat Bear Week"," ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Sept 28 (Reuters) - In Alaska, leaves are falling, daylight is dwindling and salmon-devouring brown bears are racing the clock to pack on the pounds they need to survive their winter hibernation. Unbeknownst to the enormous bruins, some of them are also competing in Katmai National Park and Preserve's Fat Bear Week, Alaska's annual celebration of gluttony and nature's abundance. For seven days starting on Wednesday, wildlife fans will submit online votes in a playoff-style competition among 12 of the park's fattest brown bears photographed at the salmon-rich Brooks River. The winner will be announced on Oct. 5. The week-long online extravaganza is a joint project of the park and two nonprofit partners: the Katmai Conservancy and explore.org, a multimedia organization that operates live nature cameras around the world, most famously its Katmai ""bear cam."" Fat Bear Week grew out of a single-day promotion in 2014 that was expanded to a full week the following year. It becomes more popular each year, with online voting growing to nearly 650,000 votes cast in 2020 from 55,000 votes cast in 2018, said Naomi Boak, a Katmai media ranger. The popularity is easy to understand, Boak said. Fat bears bring joy to people, she said. ""They get to do something and be healthy that we don't get to do, and that is be fat,"" she said. There are Fat Bear T-shirts, coffee cups and other merchandise. There is Fat Bear school curriculum, with students tuning in to learn about biology, ecology and wildlife. Katmai's bears are among the biggest in the world, thanks to the abundant runs of salmon that swim into the river system from southwestern Alaska's Bristol Bay. Katmai's bears, which number about 2,200, can grow to well over 1,000 pounds (453 kg) from summer feasting. They can also lose a third of their body weight during hibernation. This year's record Bristol Bay salmon return, which followed other recent years of big runs, has been a boon for Katmai's youngest bears. ""They benefited from being born in the time of plenty,"" Boak said. But even the older bears are looking extra-big, she said, citing as an example a 14-year-old called Walker. ""He has not grown up, but he has certainly grown out,"" she said. The connection between Bristol Bay and the fish-fattened bears of Katmai is not lost on opponents of a proposal to build a massive copper and gold mine downstream from the park. The planned project, known as Pebble Mine, would threaten the survival of the salmon that sustain the park's bruins, they say. Fat Bear Week highlights some of the resources at stake, said Jim Adams, Alaska regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association. ""It can be a reminder that the bears depend on a healthy ecosystem and the world's greatest salmon run,"" Adams said. The Biden administration said earlier this month that it intended to resurrect an Obama-era policy that could bar development of a Pebble-type mine in the Bristol Bay watershed.

lifestyle,"'Moulin Rouge!', 'The Inheritance' win biggest Tony Awards as Broadway shows off its best"," Sept 26 (Reuters) - AIDS play ""The Inheritance"" and musical ""Moulin Rouge!"" won the top honors at Broadway's Tony Awards on Sunday in a four-hour ceremony that promoted the return of live theatre and called for better opportunities for Black writers and performers. ""Tonight feels like a homecoming,"" said host Audra McDonald. ""The lights are on, we are here, we are back."" The annual awards show was never held in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic that shut down live performances for 18 months. Many of the big shows, including ""Hamilton,"" ""The Lion King,"" and ""Wicked"" had emotional reopenings earlier this month marked by tears and joy both on and off stage. Audiences must be fully vaccinated and masks are required. ""It's been over a year but the Tonys are here,"" sang ""Hamilton"" star Leslie Odom Jr, opening the TV special called ""Broadway's Back"" that featured appearances by stars ranging from John Legend and Jake Gyllenhaal to Chita Rivera and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber. ""Moulin Rouge! The Musical,"" based on the 2001 movie, won 10 awards, including best musical, and for lead actor Aaron Tveit. L1N2QS0IB Carmen Pavlovic, a co-producer of ""Moulin Rouge!,"" said every show deserved to get an award after the punishing last 18 months, including ""the shows that opened, the shows that closed not to return, the shows that nearly opened, and of course the shows that paused and were fortunate enough to be reborn."" ""The Inheritance,"" a portrait of gay life in the 21st century, was named best play and won 2 other Tonys. It also brought an impassioned appeal from its playwright Matthew Lopez, who is of Puerto Rican heritage. ""This is the 74th Tony Awards and yet I am only the first Latinate writer to win in this category,"" said Lopez. ""This must change. We are a vibrant community ... We have so many stories to tell. They are inside of us, aching to come out."" ""A Soldier's Play,"" about the murder of a black officer on a U.S. army base in 1944,"" was voted best play revival. Yet it was a disappointing night for ""Slave Play,"" a provocative show about race and sexuality that went into Sunday's ceremony with a leading 12 nominations, but won none of them. ""The table's got to be bigger,"" said Kenny Leon, director of ""A Soldier's Play,"" saying Broadway needs to do better to elevate Black voices. The anti-racism non-profit Broadway Advocacy Coalition that fights to make theatre more diverse, was given an honorary award. The TV special saw live song and dance performances from many shows, including ""Jagged Litle Pill,"" ""Ain't Too Proud,"" ""American Utopia,"" and Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth, the original stars of ""Wicked."" ""A Christmas Carol,"" a stage adaptation with music of the Charles Dickens novel, won five awards, while newcomer Adrienne Warren won best actress in a musical for playing rock singer  Tina Turner in ""Tina - The Tina Turner Musical."" None of the Tony-nominated plays are currently playing on Broadway or plan to return, after closing because of the pandemic or finishing their runs shortly before it broke.

lifestyle,Mission accomplished: critics praise Bond film 'No Time To Die'," LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - James Bond film ""No Time To Die"" may be debuting 18 months later due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but most critics said it was worth the wait. Reviews lavished praise on Daniel Craig's fifth and last outing after a 15-year tenure as the suave British secret agent, which began with 2006's ""Casino Royale"". Originally due for release in April 2020 and delayed three times since, ""It?�s #DanielCraig?�s most grounded and ??dare I say it? ??most intimate take on #JamesBond with a powerful, unexpected & very emotional payoff. Def worth the wait!,"" film critic Scott Mantz tweeted. Giving the movie five stars, Kevin Maher of Britain's The Times newspaper said it was ""better than good. It?�s magnificent."" ""Craig has occasionally been a divisive figure during this five movie stint, from his initial casting ... to his dour performance-style to his off-screen rants about the iniquities of the gig,"" he wrote. ""Yet all sins are forgiven here. He?�s a towering charismatic presence from opening frame to closing shot, and he bows out in terrific, soulful, style."" Costing an estimated $200 million to produce, ""No Time To Die"" sees Bond come out of retirement to help track down new villain Safin (Rami Malek), who is armed with lethal technology. ""Craig?�s final film as the diva of British intelligence is an epic barnstormer ... delivering pathos, action, drama, camp comedy ... heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action,"" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw wrote. He also gave it five stars. However some criticised the storyline and length. ""... The path to Craig?�s momentous departure is drowning in plot; it?�s so convoluted and protracted you might find yourself zoning out through much of the villainy,"" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote. ""Even so, it?�s doubtful that this will be a deal-breaker for many Bond completists ...  Even if the two-and-three-quarter hour running time is occasionally a slog, it ultimately delivers."" The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey gave it three stars. ""(Director) Cary Joji Fukunaga has made a smashing piece of action cinema ... it?�s just a shame it had to be a Bond film,"" she wrote, adding it felt ""strangely anti-climatic"" given the hype. The movie introduces 00 agent Nomi, played by Lashana Lynch. ""Malek is not the only newcomer to make his mark though as Lashana Lynch impresses as Nomi,"" Digital Spy's Ian Sandwell wrote. ""Quick with the one-liners and adept at the stunts, she's instantly likeable and develops a fun friction with Bond.""

Bestowed on family, friends, or anyone else in an informal setting, ""la bise"" was de facto banned at the height of the pandemic. But with more than 70% of the population fully vaccinated, people can once more be seen planting what are usually just air kisses by a kissing sound on each other's cheeks. ""We had stopped in order to respect social distancing, but it's a ritual I really like,"" civil servant Vincent Seznec said, beer in hand, after greeting friends with a ""bise."" As he is vaccinated, he could see no reason not to do it anymore. ""It's best to be vaccinated and kiss each other than not be vaccinated and not kiss each other,"" he said. Parisians Anna and Carmela, after embracing and kissing each other's cheeks, said they could not agree more. ""It's a great sign of affection and welcoming the other,"" Anna said. ""It means togetherness."" Carmela dearly missed ""la bise"" - especially when her 32-year old daughter stopped kissing her for fear of transmitting COVID-19. ""Ohhhhhhhhh, it was so sad,"" Carmela said. Even President Emmanuel Macron, who had recommended people do not kiss or shake hands to help reduce contagion risks, can now occasionaly be seen ""faire la bise"". However, several Parisians said things will never be quite the same. For one thing, people are more selective - and it has become easier to say you do not want to kiss someone on the cheeks. ""I'm doing 'la bise' again but only to loved ones, not people I don't really know well,"" Natalie Bitar said. And Elisa Mayor, a student, said that in her generation, ""la bise"" was already not that popular, even before COVID-19. ""We rather tend to say hi from afar,"" she said. But for Paris-based British comedian Paul Taylor, who shot to fame years ago with a sketch on ""la bise,"" which he called ""one of the things that annoys me most about living here,"" there is no doubt the comeback has started and it's here to stay.

lifestyle,"Revisiting 'The Sopranos,' with help of James Gandolfini's son"," LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - How do you revisit the world of ""The Sopranos"" without James Gandolfini? Cast the son of the late actor as a troubled teen who later grows up to become a conflicted Mafia leader - and one of pop culture's most beloved characters. Fourteen years after the screen famously faded to black at the end of six television seasons, ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase returns with a film prequel set in New Jersey in the 1960s and 1970s. ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" opening in U.S. movie theaters and on HBO Max on Friday, features younger versions of ""Sopranos"" characters, including Paulie, Janice, Junior, Carmela and matriarch Livia. Michael Gandolfini, who was 14 when his father died of a heart attack in 2013 at age 51, plays the young Tony Soprano, with the same hunched stance and enigmatic eyes of the middle-aged New Jersey Mafia boss who consulted a psychiatrist for panic attacks. Gandolfini had never seen the TV series, which brought his father multiple awards, before he auditioned. ""The experience of watching (the series) for the first time was very emotional. But once I sort of had gotten that out, it mostly was I was there to do a job and be the best actor that I could be,"" Gandolfini said. ""Many Saints"" director Alan Taylor said he didn't realize initially that casting Gandolfini was going to become such a talking point ""but it is the most charismatic thing about the movie in a way."" ""I was wary, because I thought how can you ask a young guy to take this on and to immerse myself in his dad? The good news is that he had wrestled with that himself and by the time he met me and we'd had an audition, he'd already made peace with it,"" said Taylor. Taylor said his mind was put at rest at a cast dinner before shooting on the movie began. ""He (Michael) stood up and said he wanted to thank everybody for giving him a chance to say hello to his dad again and goodbye again, and tearing up. ... He did a tremendous amount of homework to get his character down, and I think it has worked out."" For all the attention on Gandolfini, the young Tony Soprano is not the focus of the new film. That role belongs to the  charismatic but flawed mobster Dickie Moltisanti (played by Alessandro Nivola), who Tony viewed as his surrogate father but who died before the stories in the TV series begin. Chase said it had been ""nothing but pleasure"" returning to the world he created in the late 1990s. New Jersey venues, including Satriale's Pork Store, were recreated for the film, and key scenes take place at Holsten's restaurant. ""I think 'The Sopranos' is the favorite show that I ever wrote, and it was great going back there,"" the writer and producer said. But Chase is wary about promising to return a third time. ""Someday the public is going to turn on 'The Sopranos.' It's what happens, right? Things wear out, and I probably don't want to be around for that.""

lifestyle,Egypt forges new plan to restore Cairo's historic heart," CAIRO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Egypt is pushing ahead with a new project to restore historic Cairo, a sprawling but now rapidly crumbling thousand-year-old world heritage site home to many a tale in the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. The plan aims to revitalise and promote Cairo as a tourist attraction while the government prepares to move to a futuristic new capital in the desert. It gives fresh impetus to efforts by professional architects and restorers to also save old buildings which they feared were being lost because of bureaucracy, official corruption and legal constraints. Low-rise apartments will be built on vacant lots in the historic district, where residents and workshops will relocate as dilapidated structures are reconstructed and restored, said lead coordinator Mohamed Elkhatib. ""For the first time the budget is not a problem,"" said Elkhatib, without giving an estimate. ""They (the government) told me that any budget for Historic Cairo will be approved."" Workers will soon start improving facades of older buildings -- including those not officially listed as historic -- to match the vernacular of previous centuries. The plan also involves converting several of the city's wikalas or caravanserais, into boutique hotels, an idea proven successful elsewhere in the Middle East. ""We have actually begun working on pieces of land,"" said Elkhatib. ""Negotiations with the residents have ended and we have begun."" The government intends to renovate about 10% of the area in an initial two-year phase and is studying proposals to create a single entity for historic Cairo's roughly 30 square kms (11.6 square miles), he said. LAYERS OF HISTORY Much of the initial work will focus on restoring the districts around three grand gates built by Tunisia's Fatimid dynasty, which ruled for two centuries after its army conquered Cairo in 969 A.D. One gate, Bab al-Zuwaila, and Habbaniya Street to its south, were scenes of vignettes in the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. Historic Cairo is dense with workshops, souks and dwellings, and crafts practiced on some streets can be traced back  centuries. ""Few cities in the world have so many layers of history dating back so long,"" said Jeff Allen of the World Monuments Fund, which is working on a 16th century Sufi religious complex south of Bab al-Zuwaila. Some restorers and architects also worry about the complexity and cost of restoration, and the possibility it could lead to Disneyfication. Elkhatib says the area's character will be preserved. Alaa al-Habashi, an architect and restorer who specialises in Islamic architecture and was asked to help draw up the restoration plan, said the government was now taking into account residents, crafts, historic fabric and infrastructure, rather than focussing on monuments alone. ""The change is dramatic. It has been awaited a long time,"" Habashi said. But implementation will be key. ""I'm worried about delays,"" he said. ""I'm also worried that the principles upon which the whole project has been shaped might also somehow in the implementation be modified."" Eventually much of the area will be converted into pedestrian zones. ""The second phase is to start dealing with the historic, not the (officially) listed, buildings. We will document all these buildings and restore and reuse them,"" said Elkhatib.

Tisci, who has targeted a younger clientele with more youthful sporty looks, added oversized hoodies to the spring/summer 2022 line and layered his casualwear designs with sheer and mesh tops. There were also oversized waistcoats, plenty of long swaying fringes as well as tight-fitting tops and leggings with cut-outs. One model wore a sparkling silver bodysuit.

The recording also features the pair humming along to Christmas songs while dancing around a Christmas tree, and Lennon playing the guitar and singing ""Give Peace a Chance"" and ""Radio Peace"". Lennon wrote ""Radio Peace"" as part of the couple's peace campaign because they wanted to open a radio station in Amsterdam under the same name.

lifestyle,Britney Spears 'on cloud nine' after father suspended from conservatorship," LOS ANGELES, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The conservatorship that has controlled the life of Britney Spears for 13 years neared a possible end on Wednesday after a judge suspended her father, and the pop super-star said later that she was ""on cloud 9 right now."" At a contentious three-hour hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny removed Jamie Spears from oversight of his daughter's $60 million estate and set a November date to discuss whether to terminate the entire arrangement. In an Instagram post following the judge's ruling, the ""Stronger"" singer posted video showing her seated next to a pilot in the cockpit of a small plane and maneuvering the controls. ""First time flying a plane and first time in a prop plane !!! Geez I was scared,"" she wrote, without mentioning the conservatorship. In court, Penny removed Jamie Spears from his role after the singer's attorney said she did not want him involved for even one more day. ""The current situation is not tenable. It reflects a toxic environment which requires the suspension of Jamie Spears, effective today,"" Penny said. The judge said she would hold a hearing on Nov. 12 to discuss a petition to terminate the conservatorship that controls Britney Spears' business and personal affairs. Britney Spears, now 39, has been struggling for years to get free of the legal arrangement. She did not take part in Wednesday's hearing. ""It's a great day for Britney Spears and it's a great day for justice,"" the singer's attorney Mathew Rosengart told #FreeBritney fans gathered outside the Los Angeles courthouse. ""Britney Spears has been faced with a decade-long nightmare, a Kafkaesque nightmare, orchestrated by her father and others,"" Rosengart said. Jamie Spears will be replaced by an accountant, John Zabel, on a temporary basis, Penny said. ""IT'S LOGICAL, IT'S FAIR"" #FreeBritney fans erupted in cheers as the judge's ruling was conveyed. Pop singer Cher tweeted, ""I'm more than thrilled 4 her. Bless our super star."" Jamie Spears had been in charge of his daughter's business affairs since 2008, when he put in place a wide-ranging, court-approved conservatorship after she suffered a mental breakdown. The details of Britney Spears' mental health have never been revealed. Rosengart said he envisaged an orderly transition in which the conservatorship could end before the close of the year. ?�It?�s simple, it?�s logical, it?�s fair, it?�s just,??he told the judge. Ironically, it was Jamie Spears who earlier in September reversed years of objections and abruptly called for the conservatorship to end. But he argued that he should remain in his role to smooth the transition. Rosengart, however, demanded that Jamie Spears be suspended immediately. ""According to Britney Spears, his service has been abusive, it?�s been toxic and it?�s been cruel,??he said. A New York Times documentary released last week alleged that the singer's phone and bedroom were bugged by security staff working for her father. Conversations with friends, her children and her previous lawyer were monitored, a former security staffer said. Jamie Spears has said his actions were within his authority as conservator. ""Mr. Spears has faithfully and loyally served as a court-appointed conservator for 13 years. His record is impeccable,"" his attorney Vivian Thoreen said on Wednesday. Spears stepped up her efforts in June to break free of the conservatorship, telling the judge in her first public comments that she wanted her life back. Public support, helped by three documentaries, has swelled. Two weeks ago Britney Spears announced her engagement to Sam Asghari, 27, her personal trainer boyfriend of more than four years. The pair hope to marry after negotiating a pre-nuptial agreement. ""Free Britney! Congratulations !!!!"" Asghari wrote on his Instagram account after the hearing."
lifestyle,Bond is back: 007 film 'No Time To Die' premieres in London," LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - With a guest list made up of Oscar winners and British royalty, James Bond film ""No Time To Die"" finally held its delayed world premiere in London on Tuesday in the cinema's most high profile red carpet since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wet weather failed to dampen spirits as Daniel Craig, dressed in an eye-catching pink velvet dinner jacket, and co-stars including Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch and Lea Seydoux reunited for the hotly anticipated movie, which cinema operators hope will help bring audiences back to pre-pandemic levels. ""No Time To Die"", the 25th Bond movie, has been delayed three times since its original April 2020 slot as movie theatres around the world were forced to shut their doors as well as impose audience number restrictions due to the pandemic. The Universal Pictures and MGM film, part of one of Hollywood's biggest franchises, marks Craig's fifth and final outing as the suave British secret agent, wrapping up a 15-year tenure that began with 2006's ""Casino Royale"". ""It's such a great relief. It was so important to me to come and celebrate with all the other cast and crew and to get it into the cinemas and we're here,"" Craig told Reuters. ""A year ago I didn't think that was going to happen."" Asked what he was going to miss the most from playing 007, he said: ""The people."" Costing an estimated $200 million to produce, ""No Time To Die"" sees Bond come out of retirement in Jamaica to help track down a new villain, described by Oscar winner Malek as ""mischievous(and) devious"", and armed with lethal technology. ""The most daunting part was just coming up with a good story,"" director Cary Joji Fukunaga said. ""I think of it as a last chapter of this one book where we (first) met Daniel in 'Casino Royale' (and) it's all part of the same story."" The film introduces 00 agent Nomi, played by Lynch, who said: ""I'm just happy it's here and we get to celebrate it in the way that it deserves."" Also at the premiere were Britain's Prince Charles and his son Prince William and their wives. As a thanks for their frontline work during the pandemic, health workers and members of the armed forces were also invited. Former Bond actress Judi Dench and Grammy Award winner Billie Eilish, who sings the film's theme tune, also attended. Beginning its cinema rollout this week, ""No Time To Die"" is among the most anticipated movies this autumn. ""I know the world is expecting this film,"" said Seydoux, who reprises her ""Spectre"" role as Madeleine Swann. ""We gave everything to this film ... and I hope people will love it."" Expectations are high after the last two Bond films, 2015?�s ""Spectre"" and 2012's ""Skyfall"", grossed $880 million and more than $1 billion globally. ""Now that the cinemas are open we're really happy to be supporting the industry,"" producer Barbara Broccoli said. ""We made this film for the cinema and we want people to enjoy it.""

Cineworld said it marked its highest pre-selling film since Marvel's superhero movie ""Avengers: Endgame"" in 2019. The movie, Daniel Craig's last outing as the special agent, was postponed at least three times from its originally planned April 2020 release as the coronavirus outbreak forced cinemas around the world to close. Cinema operators have been banking on the popularity of the decades-old Bond franchise to accelerate a revival in a sector trying to get back on its feet in the face of lingering concerns about coronavirus and competition from streaming services. Cineworld said there were already ""several sold out screenings"". ""In the opening 24 hours, only 2 films have sold more tickets than NTTD (""No Time to Die"") in the past 5 years,"" said Cineworld, the owner of Regal Cinemas. Its shares were up 11% by 1515 GMT.

""The release of a James Bond film is a big event in any year ... but never more so after the last 18 months,"" UK Cinema Association head Phil Clapp said.

lifestyle,Rabat's only woman taxi driver busts stereotypes," RABAT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Souad Hdidou is challenging social norms and busting stereotypes from behind the wheel as the only female taxi driver in the Moroccan capital Rabat and one of a few in the country. Hdidou, 33, started work as a truck driver after dropping out of school and worked for a fish distribution company, but switched to taxis for the better pay and greater freedom, she said. ""I'm the kind who likes challenges,"" Hdidou said. She now earns enough to pay the mortgage on her flat near Rabat as well as supporting her family in the countryside and has built up a solid customer base. ""Mothers often trust me to pick up their kids from school when they're busy,"" she said. ""I also receive calls to pick up women at night because they feel more comfortable with me."" At the wheel of her blue sedan, sparkling clean and fragrant inside, and a heart-shaped talisman with religious verses dangling from the rear view mirror, Hdidou is a rare sight on Rabat's roads. ""We need more women taxi drivers,"" said Nouhila Asah a female client, adding that with Hdidou she can have a conversation and talk freely over the phone unlike when the driver is a man. There used to be seven women licensed as taxi drivers in the capital, but they all stopped working except Hdidou. Female taxi drivers sometimes face sexual harassment in the form of unwanted advances, she said. Even for men, the taxi business is tough in Morocco - most drivers have no access to state health and pension coverage,  and want the government to reform the sector. The taxi operating licence is so costly that many ""rent"" it from well-off people who have the right connections. Hdidou said the cost of renting the licence as well as car operating expenses account for up to 70% of her monthly revenue. The head of the taxi drivers' union, Mohamed Touiti, said he hoped the government would give drivers access to state social security. For Hdidou, she's taken a step towards fulfilling her childhood dream: ""My wish is to work in international transport... I am now in the process of getting different types of driving licences. This is Souad's life,"" she said, laughing.

The #DG Light show, which was held in a disco-like atmosphere with glimmering mirrors as a backdrop, also featured black biker jackets and camouflaged overcoats, cargo pants worn with crystal-encrusted tops, fringed gold and silver dresses. Designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana incorporated elements seen in previous collections, such as embroidery, lace, flowers, animalier prints, bras, corsets and tight black dresses.

The lights and glitzy glamour of the show were a call to leave behind the darkness of the coronavirus pandemic, they said. Veteran designer Giorgio Armani, 87, used pastel colours and soft shades of green and blue for a light collection inspired by the sea. The show featured elegant chiffon dresses, embroidered evening gowns, small tailored jackets, fluid trousers and sleeveless tops in an ode to effortless elegance. The models, at times resembling undulating mermaids, were openly smiling on the runway, and Armani said the world today needed sweetness, kindness and smiles.

lifestyle,'Massively grateful' Daniel Craig bids farewell to James Bond," LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Daniel Craig thought he had wrapped up his tenure as James Bond with ""Spectre"", but the actor says his final fifth outing as the British secret agent in ""No Time To Die"" allowed him to fully complete his 007 journey. Nearly 60 years after the first Bond film ""Dr No"" premiered, cinema's favourite spy, known for his love of fast cars and cool gadgets, returns in the highly-anticipated 25th Bond movie next week after an 18-month delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Costing an estimated $200 million to produce, ""No Time To Die"" sees Bond come out of retirement from an idyllic life in Jamaica to help track down a new villain armed with lethal technology. ""I didn't think that I was going to do another movie after ?�Spectre?? I genuinely thought that I was going to ... just pack it in,"" Craig told Reuters. ""But I'm so happy that I got the chance to come and do this one. And we tied up lots of loose ends. We've tried to tell one story with all my Bond movies. It's like they're all connected in some way and this one just sort of capped it off."" Running at nearly three hours long, the film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, promises the usual Bond action, car chases and stunts in picturesque locations, including the cave dwellings of the southern Italian city of Matera. It introduces new character Nomi, played by Black actress Lashana Lynch and described simply as a 00 agent at Bond's past employer, Britain's MI6 foreign spy service. She looks just as fierce and skilled as Bond. ""She's also a real human being. She's grounded and she's from a good background and takes every opportunity she gets and really runs with it. She's really shifted things up at MI6 and will continue to do so,"" Lynch said. ""It's groundbreaking for Black women, for my culture, for the franchise as well that have been pushing the needle forward for a long time now."" French actress Lea Seydoux reprises her role as Madeleine Swann from 2015's ""Spectre"". ""Cary wanted to explore a bit more Madeleine's character ... In a way, she's the heartbeat of the film and the relationship with Bond is much more developed,"" Seydoux said. Rami Malek joins the franchise, one of Hollywood's most valuable, as villain Safin.

lifestyle,Box Office: 'Dear Evan Hansen' Hits Wrong Notes as 'Shang-Chi' Stays No. 1," LOS ANGELES, Sept 26 (Variety.com) - ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" the Universal Pictures adaptation of the smash Broadway musical, didn't strike a chord with moviegoers. Marred by negative reviews and COVID-19 concerns, the film fell short of expectations and collected a muted $7.5 million from 3,365 North American theaters in its debut. Industry experts predicted the movie musical would make at least $10 million between Friday and Sunday. Even though the film seems unlikely to turn a profit in theaters, the losses won't be catastrophic. ""Dear Evan Hansen"" cost $28 million to produce, a modest budget for a musical. That puts Universal in a much better position compared to its last movie musical, ""Cats,"" which opened to $6.5 million in late 2019 and ultimately lost the studio nearly all of its $100 million budget. The critical response to ""Dear Evan Hansen"" has been vastly different than the glowing reactions that greeted the 2016 stage version, which netted six Tony Awards and cemented Ben Platt as a star. It underscores the struggle to bring even commercially popular musicals to the big screen. Platt reprised his role as Evan Hansen, an anxious high school student who finds himself tangled in a lie that spirals out of control. Many criticized the casting choice because Platt is 27 years old and doesn't look like a teenager. At least one positive: Audiences, at least the few who bought a ticket on opening weekend, appeared to like ""Dear Evan Hansen"" more than critics did. It landed an ""A-"" CinemaScore from moviegoers, which is exponentially better than its 33% on Rotten Tomatoes. Around 62% of patrons were female, while 53% were, like Platt, over the age of 25. Given the underwhelming turnout for ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" reigning box office champion ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" had no trouble staying atop domestic charts, even in its fourth weekend of release. The Disney and Marvel superhero adventure added a solid $13.3 million in ticket sales, bringing its domestic tally to $196.5 million, a pandemic record. After this weekend's haul, ""Shang-Chi"" surpassed its fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe installment ""Black Widow"" ($183 million) as the highest-grossing movie of the year. Unlike ""Shang-Chi,"" the Scarlett Johansson-led ""Black Widow"" wasn't available exclusively in theaters. The film premiered simultaneously on Disney Plus (for a premium $30 fee), where it has generated at least $125 million. Weeks ago, Johansson sued Disney and alleged the movie's hybrid release depressed box office ticket sales and cut into her compensation.

lifestyle,"Prada strips dresses back, foulard inspires Versace in Milan"," Sept 24 (Reuters) - Prada Co-creative directors Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, who joined the Milan-based, Hong Kong-listed luxury group last year, added silk trains on miniskirts, put corset lacing on the front of jackets and mimicked brassiere cups on knitwear. The spring/summer 2022 collection, called ""Seduction, stripped down,"" also featured long back-baring dresses in pink, lime and tangerine that were cinched at the waist. Short dresses were also slit behind and had trains while biker jackets were given a worn look and paired with the brightly coloured miniskirts. ""We thought of words like elegant - but this feels so old-fashioned. Really, it?�s about a language of seduction that always leads back to the body,"" Prada said in a statement. ""Using these ideas, these references to historical pieces, this collection is an investigation of what they mean today, what seduction means."" For accessories, there were belted arm bands and pointy slingback shoes in bright colours. Like New York and London, Milan Fashion Week is hosting both in-person shows and digital presentations this season following virtual editions in February due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the three-hour, two-part special Raisman recounts her journey to recovery and speaks with various survivors and experts on sexual abuse, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke. While she said she found the process of producing the special healing and rewarding, Raisman recalled being physically drained. ""I would be like laying on the couch or just in between interviewing survivors, and I just felt so sick and so tired,"" she told Reuters.

She wants a thorough independent probe to hold the sports bodies and FBI accountable. ""It's scary to think about how many people knew that he was an abuser and didn't do anything. And that's what's really important for people to understand, is that it really took a village to protect a pedophile,"" she said. ""Without the answers, we can't believe in a safer future and we don't know if there are still people working there or working with other children that covered up our abuse,"" Raisman added. The USOPC issued a statement saying it has implemented reforms after hiring a law firm to conduct an independent investigation. Six years after first speaking out, Raisman said she is learning to love gymnastics again. ""I basically lived in the gym,"" she said. ""There were some days I would train up to six to seven hours.

Starting from the fall 2022 collections, none of the group?�s houses will use fur, the statement said. ""The time has now come to take a further step forward by ending the use of fur in all our collections. The world has changed, along with our clients, and luxury naturally needs to adapt to that,"" François-Henri Pinault, Chairman and CEO of Kering, said. While the group?�s houses, which include Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen, Brioni and Saint Laurent, have phased out fur in recent years, Friday's company-wide ban closes the door to its use in the future, even in the event of a change in creative direction.

lifestyle,Meet the gadget that helps visually-impaired people dodge street hazards," PARIS, Sept 24 (Reuters) - As she walks down a Paris sidewalk, visually-impaired Frenchwoman Laurence Jamet approaches a garbage can blocking her path. A beep sounds in her ears to warn her of the obstacle, she takes a step to the right to dodge it, and continues on her way. Jamet is using an electronic device, developed by a French company, that uses sensors to spot an obstacle in the path of a user and gives them the information they need to go around it. Blind since birth, Jamet has for years used a white stick to get around. It allows her to scan at ground level for obstacles, but it does not stop her colliding with objects sticking out above, like for example the open door of a truck. ""It's not unusual for me to come home with a bloodied forehead,"" said Jamet. The device, which mounts on the top of her cane and sends information to her via headphones, fills that gap. ""I get hit much less, and so I am less stressed,"" Jamet said of her experience using the gadget. According to Francois Birot, co-founder of Gosense, the firm that developed the device, the big challenge was to not overload the user with information. The device is designed to work out the user's trajectory, and only let them know about obstacles directly in their path. If the obstacle is ahead of them but to the right, the alarm will sound in their right ear, letting them know they need to take a detour to the left. To date, the device is being used by nearly 400 people in France, with a handful of models in use in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Italy. It sells for 2,000 euros ($2,348), though eligible people in France have most of the cost reimbursed by local government agencies.

lifestyle,Argentine artist reflects Parana River drought in giant murals," SAN NICOLAS DE LOS ARROYOS, Argentina, Sept 24 (Reuters) - In the Argentine city of San Nicolas de los Arroyos, which hugs the banks of the Parana River, two huge murals reflect local worries about a growing environmental issue for the region - the declining levels of the waterway. The two 40-meter-high (130-ft) paintings on the sides of buildings in the city center were spurred by the artist's desire to stir debate over the river's decline. Hit by a lack of rainfall upriver in Brazil, this year the Parana reached its lowest One mural shows a boy extracting a native flower from the river, while the other depicts a girl whose image is reflected in the water. ""When I came to San Nicolas I was struck by the historic low level of the Parana River,"" Argentine muralist Martin Ron, who has created hundreds of murals around the world, told Reuters. ""These characters that I use always interact with an aspect of the place in the context where I paint and it seemed appropriate to portray this ecological message related to the decline of the Parana."" The river, which begins in Brazil before snaking through Paraguay and then Argentina to the ocean, carries some 80% of Argentina's farm exports of soy, corn and wheat, taken in giant Panamax ships from inland farm regions to the world. It is key to the country's economic wellbeing, as well as creating an important wetland ecosystem near the river delta. The low levels have seen ships forced to take on smaller loads to sit higher in the water, hindering trade and hurting what is usually a competitive advantage for the country - the deep waterways that allow access for big container vessels. Ron said his art was meant to play an active role in encouraging people to look at what needs to change. The 40-year-old artist paints between 10 and 12 murals every year and has morphed his style from urban surrealism to what he calls ""magical hyper-realism."" Other murals he has done include a girl building with Lego blocks and a portrait of soccer player Carlos Tevez. Although Ron spends much of his life on cranes and scaffolding, the artist confesses he suffers vertigo. ""There's a somewhat love-hate relationship with how I do my work because ironically I am very afraid of heights,"" he said.

lifestyle,Cinema returns to Somalia after decades of shut-downs and strife," MOGADISHU, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Dozens of Somalis posed for selfies and chattered excitedly in rows of red, plush seats as they waited for the start of their country's first movie screening in three decades. Among the crowd in the National Theatre was 24-year-old Kaif Jama, the writer and star of both films on the programme - the horror story ""Hoos"", about a single woman moving into an empty house, and a not-so-romantic comedy called ""Date from Hell"". ""This means something for everyone including me. This is for every Somali who wants to make movies,"" Jama said, wearing a traditional Somali dress striped silver, yellow and green. She left Somalia when she was six and moved between Kenya and Uganda before settling in Cairo aged 19. Since then, she has made 60 short films and skits with Somali filmmaker Ibrahim CM. Somalis have spent years watching Indian and Arab films on their televisions, she said. ""But if our own movies come to cinema and TVs then every single Somali person and child will be shaped and influenced by their own culture."" The National Theatre, a gift from China's Mao Zedong, opened its doors in 1967. It became an important home for Somalia's rich storytelling tradition, hosting plays, musical extravaganzas and, in the 1980s, pan-African film festivals. After the overthrow of president Siad Barre in 1991, clan-based warlords blasted each other with anti-aircraft guns and fought over the theatre, which they used as a base. The building was hit so many times that the roof collapsed a year into the conflict. Islamist militants who seized control in 2006 took over the building. They banned all forms of public entertainment - from concerts to football matches - that they considered sinful. African Union peacekeeping troops clawed back control of the capital in 2011 and the new Western-backed Somali government reopened the venue the following year. But just three weeks after that, a suicide bomber from the Islamist al Shabaab insurgency struck during a ceremony, killing six people. The building reopened again in 2020. Mogadishu resident Hassan Abdulahi Mohamed remembered spending half a Somali shilling on a movie ticket and one shilling on snacks at the theatre in the 1960s.

lifestyle,Linda Evangelista files $50 mln lawsuit over disfiguring cosmetic treatment," LOS ANGELES, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Former supermodel Linda Evangelista has filed a $50 million lawsuit over cosmetic procedures that she says left her ""brutally disfigured"" and turned her into a recluse. The Canadian model, one of the biggest figures on runways and magazine covers in the 1990s, said in an Instagram post that she had undergone treatment to reduce fat some five years ago. ""To my followers who have wondered why I have not been working while my peers??careers have been thriving, the reason is that I was brutally disfigured by Zeltiq?�s CoolSculpting procedure which did the opposite of what it promised,??she wrote in the posting on Wednesday. She said she suffered a rare side effect called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH) after the procedures, which causes people to develop a swelling in the areas that were treated. ?�PAH has not only destroyed my livelihood, it has sent me into a cycle of deep depression, profound sadness, and the lowest depths of self-loathing. In the process, I have become a recluse,??she said. Zeltiq Aesthetics, a unit of Allergan Aesthetics and parent company AbbVie Evangelista filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in New York federal court against Zeltiq for negligence, misleading advertising and alleging that the company failed to warn customers of the possible side effects. The lawsuit says Evangelista underwent multiple procedures between 2015 and 2016 to reduce fat on her thighs, abdomen, back, flanks and chin. Corrective surgery had not worked to fix the PAH. She is seeking $50 million in damages for lost income and emotional distress, saying she was now unemployable as a model and has not earned anything from modeling since 2016.

A colleague, Cassandre Schneider, is in charge of training the geese. She got them as hatchlings, and spent hours in their company. They took her for their mother, and began following her everywhere. Once they grew flight feathers, she started going up in a microlight, first for a one minute flight, then for twice that time the next day. The geese followed. Now aged around three months, the geese can shadow the microlight for around an hour, flapping hard when it climbs, then gliding in its slipstream when it cruises. When the geese reach about three years old, they will instinctively want to join the migration routes, so the plan is to help them return to the wild. Looking ahead to the moment she has to part with her proteges, Schneider said: ""It will be hard, no question, but it's for their well-being.""

According to a Wednesday filing in Manhattan federal court, Gooding never saw the complaint from the accuser known as Jane Doe until Aug. 3, five days after U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty granted her a Gooding's lawyer Edward Sapone said Doe's process server delivered the $6 million lawsuit to an apartment where the actor's girlfriend lived, but that Gooding never lived there and the doorman did not want to accept the paperwork. ""No one ever served me with the summons and complaint, including the doorman,"" Gooding said in a signed affidavit. ""While I respect plaintiff and her counsel, I respectfully deny her allegations [and] seek to have the default vacated so I can defend myself,"" he added. A stipulation signed by one of Doe's lawyers said Doe ""consents to vacate the entry of default."" Gooding agreed to cover Doe's legal fees for obtaining the default judgment. Gloria Allred, another lawyer for Doe, said in an email her client looked forward to testifying against Gooding in court if his default were set aside. Doe said the alleged rapes occurred at the Mercer hotel in Manhattan's SoHo district, soon after she met Gooding in a Greenwich Village restaurant and lounge. She said Gooding asked her up to his room, saying he needed to quickly change clothes, but pushed her onto a bed, raped her, and raped her again as she tried to flee. Doe said she told him ""No"" numerous times. In Wednesday's filing, Sapone said Gooding and at least two other witnesses would testify that Doe was not vaginally or anally raped, or held in any hotel room against her will. Gooding won a best supporting actor Academy Award in 1997 for ""Jerry Maguire,"" and portrayed O.J. Simpson in the 2016 television miniseries ""The People v. O.J. Simpson.""

lifestyle,Nigerians offer artworks to British Museum in new take on looted bronzes," BENIN CITY, Nigeria, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A new guild of artists from Nigeria's Benin City has offered to donate artworks to the British Museum in London as a way to encourage it to return the priceless Benin Bronzes that were looted from the city's royal court by British troops in 1897. Created in the once mighty Kingdom of Benin from at least the 16th century onwards, the bronze and brass sculptures are among Africa's finest and most culturally significant artefacts. European museums that house them have faced years of criticism because of their status as loot and symbols of colonial greed. The Ahiamwen Guild of artists and bronze casters says it wants to change the terms of the debate by giving the British Museum contemporary artworks, untainted by any history of looting, that showcase Benin City's modern-day culture. ""We never stopped making the bronzes even after those ones were stolen,"" said Osarobo Zeickner-Okoro, a founding member of the new guild and the instigator of the proposed donation. ""I think we make them even better now."" ""Part of the crime that's been committed, it's not just ok, these were looted, it's the fact that you've portrayed our civilisation as a dead civilisation, you've put us among ancient Egypt or something,"" he said. The artworks on offer, unveiled in Benin City in a ceremony attended by a member of the royal court, include a 2-metre-by-2-metre bronze plaque with carvings representing historical events in Benin, and a life-size ram made entirely from spark plugs. Asked to comment on the offer, the British Museum said only that it was a matter for discussion between itself and the parties offering the objects. Zeickner-Okoro, who travelled from Benin City to London this month partly to advance his initiative, said he had a meeting coming up with curators from the museum's Africa department. While Germany has said it wants to return Benin Bronzes from its museums to Nigeria, the British Museum, which houses the largest and most significant collection of the items, has stopped short of making a clear commitment. It says on its website that its director, Hartwig Fischer, had an audience with the Oba, or king, of Benin in 2018 ""which included discussion of new opportunities for sharing and displaying objects from the Kingdom of Benin"". But many people in Benin City see no justification for European museums holding onto loot. ""They must bring it back. It is not their father's property. The property belongs to the Oba of Benin,"" said bronze caster Chief Nosa Ogiakhia. Zeickner-Okoro, who grew up partly in Britain before moving back to Benin City, acknowledged that the Benin Bronzes' presence in European museums had allowed them to reach a global audience. But he said they should now return to the place and the people that created them. ""The descendants of the people who cast those bronzes, they've never seen that work because most of them can't afford to fly to London to come to the British Museum,"" he said. ""They have these catalogues, PDF copies of the catalogue from the British Museum, which they use to reference the work of their ancestors, and I think it's so sad.""

lifestyle,Green-thumbed Thai cabbies turn taxis into gardens amid COVID-19 crunch," BANGKOK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - With demand for taxis drying up in Thailand and thousands of drivers leaving town, one Bangkok cab company has turned its vehicles into mini vegetable gardens, hoping to take the edge off the coronavirus crunch. The Ratchapruek Taxi Cooperative has taken hundreds of cars off the road in the past year amid a slowing economy worsened by months of lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which has left many drivers with insufficient income to pay the lease on their vehicles. The cooperative grows vegetables on the roofs and bonnets of 300 of the disused cabs, providing its drivers and members with food to share while sending a message to the government to do more to help with the hardship. ""We discussed among each other and decided to grow vegetables to eat because there is no use for these taxis,"" said Thapakorn Asawalertkul, a business consultant for the company.

""Groceries are here! Groceries are here!"" a monk announces through a loudspeaker. Their mission is to donate food and necessities to vulnerable people hard hit by the pandemic.

""I feel scared (of the virus) just like other human beings, but to me, I'm more scared of not being able to help others."" The truck goes out on Sundays, making multiple trips and reaching hundreds, potentially thousands of people each month, Pornchai said. As the truck arrives, residents start to gather, each allowed to pick five sacks of produce, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, garlic and chillies, along with other goods like  soap, rice and eggs. ""This food will make me feel less hungry for a couple of days,"" said Montri Boontheab, who drove a bus for Chinese visitors before the coronavirus put the brakes on tourism.

So much so, that the night's first presenter, comic actor-writer Seth Rogen, joked that the site of hundreds of attendees assembled unmasked in an enclosed space, with no obvious sign of social distancing, made him uncomfortable even though vaccinations were mandated. ""Let me start by saying there are way too many of us in this little room. What are we doing?"" Rogen, resplendent in a bright orange sport jacket, nervously dead-panned within the first few minutes of the show. ""We're in a hermetically sealed tent right now. I would not have come to this."" From the opening hip-hop song-and-dance number, ""Just a Friend,"" performed as a vibrant sing-along led by the show's host, Cedric the Entertainer, organizers sought to project entertainment value and glitz despite lingering public health and travel restrictions. Show producers sought in media interviews beforehand to assure viewers that the 73rd annual Emmys would, indeed, be conducted safely, even as they worked to render the show with the look of a glamorous, Although attendees' faces were uncovered while on camera, it was masks up during commercial breaks - a routine many screen performers have become accustomed to as they returned to work on production sets in the midst of the pandemic. The telecast even played COVID-19 safety for laughs, as when comedian and presenter Ken Jeong was shown being denied admission by a security officer because he lacked sufficient proof of vaccination. 'WE'RE ALL VAXED' ""Dude, I didn't get four booster shots to present remotely,"" Jeong insisted to a security guard during the gag, before announcing ""Saturday Night Live"" as the winner for best variety sketch series. According to producers, and Cedric, the precautions were very real. ""We're all vaxed,"" the host told viewers early in the show. ""I got vaxed, and I did not have a reaction like Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend,"" a reference to a headline-making but unsubstantiated vaccination side-effects claim made by the Trinidadian rap star. The CBS network show was broadcast from an air-conditioned tent outdoors at the L.A. Live entertainment complex in downtown Los Angeles where, vaccinated and tested, 500 TV luminaries sat at tables, rather than in the auditorium setting normally packed with far more people for such affairs. It marked one of the larger in-person gatherings of celebrities for an entertainment award show since the pandemic began in early 2019, and was a far cry from last year's largely virtual Zoom-like Emmy broadcast hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. Seating for Sunday's event was limited to no more than four tickets per nomination. And owing to persistent travel limitations, many of the Emmy contenders joined the proceedings by satellite from London. A contingent of British nominees, including cast members, producers, writers and directors of one of the night's big winners, ""The Crown,"" gathered at the Soho House nightclub in London, eight hours ahead of the Pacific time zone, making it a middle-of-the-night affair for them. The broadcast repeatedly, and seamlessly cut to London throughout the show as ""The Crown,"" tracing the story of Britain's Queen Elizabeth and the royal family, amassed awards for best lead actor and lead actress in a drama and for best drama series, among others. Politics, which has increasingly emerged as a Hollywood awards season motif, was largely avoided. One of the few notable exceptions came as CBS' ""The Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert took the stage to present the award for best supporting actress in a drama - the winner was Gillian Anderson for ""The Crown"" - and spoofed California's recent gubernatorial recall election. Colbert's show later won an Emmy for its live broadcast on Election Night 2020. In one of the more memorable acceptance speeches of the night, Renée Elise Goldsberry of Broadway's history-themed musical hit ""Hamilton,"" which won for best pre-recorded variety special, gave a nod to the key cultural role television played during the pandemic, while sounding a note of hope over the impending return of Broadway.

lifestyle,Gaza artist mixes beauty with pain in her ballet paintings," GAZA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Palestinian artist Abeer Jebril's dark-coloured paintings show ballerinas chained in barbed wire, dancing on rocks, or facing barricades to mirror what she calls the ""ticking bomb"" reality of women in Gaza. She hopes her portraits will bring attention to the social and political problems women face in Gaza, home to two million people and devastated by wars and economic restrictions. The artist said her work also depicts restrictions that women face within the family and the community in Gaza, a traditionally conservative territory ruled by the Islamist Hamas  group since 2007. Inspired by Edgar Degas, a French Impressionist artist, Jebril said a ballet dancer depicts women as beautiful, free, powerful and athletic. ""The reason I chose the ballet dancer is that I see her as an icon of beauty and power. Therefore, I chose her to become the hero of my works,"" Jebril, 35, told Reuters at her house in Gaza City. ""It shows what the woman feels, lives, faces and how she is chained, it shows what she feels in Gaza to the audience,"" she said, sitting in front of several of her paintings. One painting depicts a dancer with her feet chained in barbed wire. Another is stepping on rocks while a third woman wraps her body around a grenade. ""Men and women are both in chains under the occupation,"" Jebril said, referring to Israel, which along with Egypt, imposes tight border restrictions on Gaza on the grounds of security. She said her paintings also shed light on how ""women suffer from the dominance of men and the inability to have a say on issues that matter"". Men and women, Jebril said, ""live in a ticking bomb in Gaza"", not knowing what will happen next. Jebril said she gets ideas for her paintings from moves by international ballet dancers and those of her 11-year-old daughter Maya, who dances ballet. Her portaits, created using painter's knives, have been displayed in galleries in some European and Arab countries. ""I felt despair seeing paintings displayed outside (Gaza) and I couldn't be there.

But events soon changed that.

Announcing the upcoming sale of the document on the 234th anniversary of its signing by delegates to the Constitutional Convention, Sotheby's estimated its value at $15 million to $20 million. ""It's the official printing, the first printing of the final text of the United States Constitution done probably on the evening of the 16th of September, 1787, only for the use of the delegates to the Continental Convention and for the use of the Congress of the United States,"" said Sotheby's Senior Specialist for Books and Manuscripts, Selby Kiffer. ""This is the only one that is not in a permanent institutional collection."" It last sold for $165,000 in 1988, when it was acquired by the late S. Howard Goldman, a New York real estate developer and private collector of American autographs, historical documents and manuscripts. His wife, Dorothy Tapper Goldman, is offering it for sale, with all proceeds going to the charitable foundation established in her name to further the public's understanding of democracy, the auction house said. Copies from that first printing, bearing no signatures and believed to have originally numbered about 500, were furnished to delegates of the Constitutional Convention. Two surviving copies are housed at the Library of Congress. The Constitution's first printing is considerably rarer than even the first edition of the 1776 Declaration of Independence, Sotheby's said. It contains only the seven original articles laying out the framework for the U.S. national government and its powers, its relationship to the states, and procedures used to subsequently ratify and amend the Constitution itself. The Bill of Rights, consisting of the first 10 amendments added to the Constitution, did not come until 1791. Although not signed, the six-page document includes a list of the Constitutional Convention delegates attesting to its adoption in 1787 and a letter of submission from George Washington, who presided over the convention. Regarded as the oldest, continuing codified government charter in the world, the U.S. Constitution was devised to replace the young nation's first, largely inefficient charter, the Articles of Confederation. It was ratified by the states in 1788 and went into effect the following year. It has since been amended 27 times. Sotheby's said the Goldman copy would be offered for bid at a New York event sometime in November. ""There were vivid debates about whether it should be ratified or not,"" Kiffer said. ""And those debates continue today. It's the foundational document that's going to last, I think, long beyond the current political atmosphere.""

Soon after the April 2019 blaze, President Emmanuel Macron said the cathedral - which dates back to the 12th century - would be rebuilt and later promised to get it reopened to worshippers by 2024, when France hosts the Olympic Games. The final phase of efforts to secure its structure included reinforcing the fire-damaged vaults with giant wooden arch-shaped frames, the state agency leading the work said, adding that it was on track to meet Macron's reopening target date. The cathedral will be restored to its previous design, including the 96-metre (315-feet) spire designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the mid-1800s and for which new timber has been selected. Restoration work is expected to start during the coming months following a bidding process to select companies.

The suit filed on Gaprindashvili's behalf in a U.S. federal court in Los Angeles said the reference to her was ""degrading her accomplishments before an audience of many millions"". The legal papers seen by Reuters said the five-times world champion was ""the first woman in history to achieve the status of international chess grandmaster among men"". She had played against at least 59 male chess players by 1968, the year in which the episode was set, according to the legal papers. Netflix did not immediately reply to a request for comment but was cited in U.S. media as saying it would ""vigorously defend the case"". ""We believe this claim has no merit,"" a spokesperson for U.S. streaming giant was quoted as saying. ""The Queen's Gambit"", based on a 1983 novel by Walter Tevis, tells the story of young orphan Beth Harmon who becomes the world's best chess player in the Cold War era. Harmon, who is played by Anya Taylor-Joy, is described by Netflix as someone ""determined to conquer the traditional boundaries established in the male-dominated world of competitive chess."" The series won two Golden Globes this year and nabbed 18 nominations at this weekend's 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards. It is said to have inspired more women to take up chess. Gaprindashvili's lawyers say the series, released in October 2020, caused her professional harm and want the line about her never facing men removed, calling it ""grossly sexist and belittling"". The lawsuit accuses the series of continuing to cause Gaprindashvili, who competes in senior chess tournaments, ""irreparable damage"".

lifestyle,"""A crazy dream come true"": Macron inaugurates the Wrapped Arc de Triomphe"," PARIS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday inaugurated a posthumous installation conceived by the late artist Christo that envelops Paris's Arc de Triomphe monument in 2,500 square metres of silvery blue, recyclable plastic wrapping. ""This is the achievement of a 60-year-old dream, a crazy dream come true,"" said Macron, who was accompanied by his wife Brigitte and officials ranging from Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot to Paris Mayor and Presidential hopeful Anne Hidalgo. Macron said he was particular happy the installation took place at the Arc de Triomphe because the monument had ""suffered so much at the end of 2018"", alluding to the looting and vandalism at the Arc de Triomphe during an anti-government  ""yellow vest"" protest that degenerated in December 2018. Imagined in 1961 by the late Bulgarian-born artist Christo, ""L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped"" was finally brought to life by Christo's nephew, Vladimir Yavatchev, at a cost of about 14 million euros ($16.54 million). Christo, whose full name was Christo Javacheff, was known for his larger-than-life installations. He wrapped up a stretch of coastline in Australia and the Reichstag parliament building in Berlin, and strung up a huge curtain in part of a canyon in Colorado. He worked closely with  his wife Jeanne-Claude on the projects. The pair covered Paris's Ponf Neuf bridge in yellow cloth in 1985. The Arc de Triomphe project, involving the most visited monument in Paris that looms over one end of the Champs-Elysees, will still allow tourists to visit the site and its panoramic terrace. The monument is also home to a tribute to the Unknown Soldier, in the form of a flame of remembrance that is rekindled every day. The installation will be on view from Sept. 18 to Oct. 3. Our Standards: France wants to be a leader in green hydrogen by 2030 and build low-carbon planes and small nuclear reactors as part of a 30 billion euro ($35 billion) investment plan, President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday."
lifestyle,'Worn Out' - Dutch museum finds Van Gogh drawing of tired old man," AMSTERDAM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - A Dutch museum on Thursday unveiled a previously unknown work by Vincent van Gogh -- a study for one of his best-known drawings, ""Worn Out"" -- in which an old man sits in a chair with his head in his hands. Van Gogh ""was really interested in the ordinary person, he was also looking to express emotion,"" said Van Gogh Museum Director Emilie Gordenker. ""I think we?�re all coming out of the COVID period feeling like this and the amazing thing is that we can share this with our visitors. We?�re open, we?�re delighted to be open.??Discoveries of works by the famously troubled artist, who died in 1890, are extremely rare. The drawing is owned by a private collector and had never been known of or displayed. ""So when (the owner) came to the museum it was a big surprise,"" said Senior Researcher Teio Meenendorp, adding that the piece was relatively easy to authenticate. The 50 x 30 cm (20 x 12 inch) work was done with Van Gogh's favourite drawing tool, a carpenter's pencil, in his distinctive style, on water-marked paper from 1877. It closely resembles the more famous ""Old Man"" drawing, but the perspective is at eye-level with the old man, rather than from above. The work can be dated with unusual precision to the last weeks of November 1882, Meenendorp said, because of two letters Van Gogh wrote on Nov. 24 of that year. It was a period of relative stability for the artist while he was living with a woman in The Hague. One letter was to his brother Theo, saying he had made two drawings of ""an old man with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands"" and that he was thinking of making it into a lithograph. ""What a fine sight an old working man makes, in his patched bombazine suit with his bald head,"" Vincent wrote. The other letter was to a fellow artist, saying with confidence he planned to make a lithograph of the theme. Van Gogh did make the lithograph, titled ""At Eternity's Gate"", three days later, on Nov. 27, 1882. Meenendorp said Van Gogh had given the works English titles partly in hopes his drawings might be noticed and lead to a job for him as an illustrator for a magazine. That never happened. Van Gogh had little commercial success while he was alive, despite winning great acclaim later. The Dutch artist was troubled by mental illness and considered himself a failure. He returned to the theme with an oil painting known as ""Sorrowing Old Man"", based on the lithograph, two months before his own death. Van Gogh died on July 29, 1890, of a self-inflicted gun wound.

Forced for a second year to abandon the traditional mass gathering of celebrities and executives, Cedric the Entertainer will host a scaled-back show in Los Angeles on Sunday that has been moved to an outdoor tent because of concerns over the Delta variant. Despite vaccination, testing and masking requirements, Jennifer Aniston is among those who won't be attending, citing her personal safety. And many of the cast of drama series favorite ""The Crown"" will likely take part from London, organizers said. ""We do have some people wanting to dial in, and we understand that,"" Maury McIntyre, president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, told Variety this week. ""It's only about 500 in the tent, but 500 is still a lot for some people,"" McIntyre said. Last year, the Emmys was held virtually with celebrities joining remotely from homes, gardens and hotel rooms around the world rather than the usual in-person event for more than 4,000 people. Television viewing exploded during the pandemic, sending people stuck at home to vast libraries of content on streaming platforms. ""Ted Lasso,"" a heartwarming comedy about a fish-out-of-water American coaching a struggling British soccer team, and British royal series ""The Crown,"" are expected to be some of the beneficiaries this year. ""Ted Lasso"" scored 20 Emmys nods, including best comedy series, and nominations for lead actor Jason Sudeikis and six other actors.

Awards experts predict it will take home its first best drama series Emmy, clinching a milestone win for Netflix ""If 'The Crown' and 'Ted Lasso' both end up winning the best TV series race, it will mark the total conquest of television by the streaming services,"" O' Neil said. Amazon ""I would be shocked if 'The Crown' did not win,"" said Gerrad Hall, senior TV editor at Entertainment Weekly. ""It was a stellar season and every single performance on that show is awards-worthy."" ""The Crown"" will compete for best drama series - the top award - against ""Star Wars"" TV spinoff ""The Mandalorian"" featuring the beloved Baby Yoda, ""Bridgerton,"" ""The Boys,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" ""Pose,"" ""Lovecraft Country"", and the sole mainstream network series ""This is Us."" Streaming services also dominate the limited series field, which pundits say is too close to call.

lifestyle,Colourful catwalk shows return at hybrid London Fashion Week," LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A hybrid London Fashion Week kicked off on Friday, with a mix of digital presentations and the event's first in-person shows in a year. International press and buyers were back watching the catwalk presentations, including displays from menswear designer and choreographer Saul Nash and Turkish-born Bora Aksu. ""It feels really great to be back,"" Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council (BFC), told Reuters. ""We're excited to see those key media and retailers that help drive British business."" The line-up features 79 physical events - including shows, appointments and presentations - and 82 digital productions. Only a handful of designers held in-person catwalk shows last September. At in-person events ""we will be asking for proof of vaccination, we will be encouraging everybody to test every morning,"" Rush said. ""And if people haven't been vaccinated, then testing every morning will be absolutely mandatory as well. Backstage is much stricter ... and we will be encouraging people to wear masks."" This season, the BFC has teamed up with short-video platform TikTok to host its NEWGEN programme aimed at up-and-coming designers. Saul Nash dressed models in relaxed loungewear including shiny or printed tracksuits and matching polo tops and shorts. Known for her feminine designs, Alice Temperley took inspiration from Agatha Christie mystery ""Death on the Nile""  for her spring/summer 2022 collection. In a pre-recorded video, models wore floral, leaf and zebra-print dresses, checked trouser suits and safari-inspired denim jumpsuits. For evening wear, there were green silky and black sparkly gowns. Bora Aksu turned to late Amsterdam socialite Mathilde Willink, known for her bold style, for his spring line of colourful, ruffled dresses, flared trousers and knit ensembles. In an outdoor garden show, models wore silk tulle and taffeta dresses in hot pink, green, yellow, red and coral - some adorned in floral embellishments. There were also pussy bow collars, cropped jackets and trench coats, accessorised with knotted headscarves. ""As we're stepping into this new world after a lockdown ... I tried to inject this kind of humour and encouragement, and just saying that we don't actually need to limit ourselves with fitting in a box, we can be free,"" Aksu told Reuters. The luxury goods industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with demand dwindling due to store closures and travel restrictions.

lifestyle,Sotheby's to auction rare first printing of U.S. Constitution," Sept 17 (Reuters) - An extremely rare official first-edition printed copy of the U.S. Constitution, as adopted by America's founding fathers at a convention in Philadelphia in 1787, will be put up for bid by Sotheby's in mid-November, the auction house announced on Friday. Sotheby's, announcing the upcoming sale of the document on the 234th anniversary of its signing by delegates to the Constitutional Convention, estimated its value at $15 million to $20 million. It last sold for $165,000 in 1988, when it was acquired by the late S. Howard Goldman, a New York real estate developer and  private collector of American autographs, historical documents and manuscripts. His wife, Dorothy Tapper Goldman, is offering it for sale, with all proceeds going to the charitable foundation established in her name to further the public's understanding of democracy, the auction house said. The document is one of just 11 known existing copies - the only one still in private hands - from the official first printing of the final text of the Constitution, as adopted in Philadelphia and submitted to the Continental Congress for review, Sotheby's said. Copies from that first printing, bearing no signatures and believed to have originally numbered about 500, were also furnished to delegates of the Constitutional Convention itself. Two surviving copies are housed at the Library of Congress. The Constitution's first printing is considerably rarer than even the first edition of the 1776 Declaration of Independence, Sotheby's said. The first constitutional printing contains only the seven original articles laying out the framework for the U.S. national government and its powers, its relationship to the states and procedures used to subsequently ratify and amend the Constitution itself. The Bill of Rights, consisting of the first 10 amendments added to the Constitution in 1791, are not included. Although not signed, the six-page document going up for sale includes a list of the Constitutional Convention delegates attesting to its adoption in 1787 and a letter of submission from George Washington, who presided over the convention, to the Continental Congress. Regarded as the oldest, continuing codified government charter in the world, the U.S. Constitution was devised to replace the young nation's first, largely inefficient charter, the Articles of Confederation. It was ratified by the states in 1788 and went into effect the following year. It has since been amended 27 times. Sotheby's said the Goldman copy would be offered for bid at a New York evening sales event on a November date to be announced, marking the first time a manuscript or historical document will be presented for auction along with major pieces of fine art. ""The Goldman Constitution ranks as one of the most rare and coveted historical documents that has ever come to auction,"" Selby Kiffer, senior specialist in Sotheby's books & manuscripts department, said in a statement.

Harry and Meghan, who quit their royal duties last year and moved from Britain to California, are featured on one of seven worldwide covers highlighting the honorees. The photo shows the couple, who are titled the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, dressed casually with a background of trees. Time magazine editor in chief Edward Felsenthal said the 100 list features ""extraordinary leaders from around the world working to build a better future"" who ""in a year of crisis have leaped into the fray"". The 100 list, which is not ranked, included 54 women. It also comprised political figures such as U.S. President Joe Biden, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former U.S. President Donald Trump. Harry and Meghan left Britain in 2020 to build an independent life, launching their Archewell Foundation as well as cutting lucrative deals for producing TV shows and a podcast. Chef Jose Andres, who funded the World Kitchen nonprofit that partners with the Archewell Foundation, wrote in a tribute that it would have been safer for the couple to stay silent. ""That?�s not what Harry and Meghan do, or who they are...In a world where everyone has an opinion about people they don?�t know, the duke and duchess have compassion for the people they don?�t know.

lifestyle,Freddie Mercury NFTs go on sale for AIDS charity," LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Four non-fungible token (NFT) artworks inspired by late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury are being auctioned off for charity to mark what would have been his 75th birthday. Three show the singer while the fourth is a dreamlike depiction of a white grand piano with a crown on its stool, surrounded by a pond of swimming goldfish. The works by artists Blake Kathryn, Chad Knight, Mat Maitland and MBSJQ will be sold in a timed auction on digital art marketplace SuperRare over 75 hours starting on Sept. 20, organisers said.

lifestyle,"Will of Queen Elizabeth's late husband will be sealed, court decides"," LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The will of Prince Philip, the late husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, will be sealed and remain private for at least 90 years to preserve the monarch's dignity, a judge at London's High Court has ruled. Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had been married to the 95-year-old British monarch for more than seven decades, died at the age of 99 at his wife's Windsor Castle home to the west of London on April 9. In keeping with a convention dating back to 1910, Andrew McFarlane, the president of the court's Family Division, said he had agreed Philip's will should be sealed up ""and that no copy of the will should be made for the record or kept on the court file"". He also ruled in favour of the request ""to exclude the value of the estate from the grant of probate"". ""The degree of publicity that publication would be likely to attract would be very extensive and wholly contrary to the aim of maintaining the dignity of the Sovereign,"" McFarlane said in a ruling published on Thursday. He said the convention was that following the death of a senior royal, an application to seal the will was made to the Family Division president, with such hearings and judgments kept private. However, he said ""as is plain from this judgment"" he considered it was a ""necessary and proportionate intrusion into the private affairs of Her Majesty and the Royal Family to make public the fact that an application to seal the will of HRH The Prince Philip ... has been made and granted in private, and to explain the underlying reasons"". The judge said 90 years should pass from the granting of probate before the will should be unsealed in private before possible publication, a period he said was ""proportionate and sufficient"". He said the first royal whose will was sealed was Prince Francis of Teck, who was the younger brother of George V's wife Queen Mary. He said he was the custodian of a safe containing more than 30 envelopes with the wills of dead royals. The most recent additions were made in 2002 following the deaths of Queen Elizabeth's mother, Elizabeth, and her sister Princess Margaret, he said.

lifestyle,A bird's eye view of Israel's deserted streets on Yom Kippur," JERUSALEM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Seen from above, it could be mistaken for a COVID-19 lockdown: highways typically jammed with traffic nearly deserted, save for a few pedestrians unhurriedly crossing the street. But Thursday's virtual standstill in Israel - captured by Reuters drone video - is in fact an annual affair as the country marks Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Businesses close, air traffic is halted and most Israelis refrain from driving on the Jewish ""Day of Atonement"", emptying city centres and streets across the country. Many in Israel's Jewish majority mark Yom Kippur by fasting during the 25-hour holy period, which began at dusk on Wednesday and ends after dark on Thursday. Others, including many children, take advantage of the deserted highways to ride bicycles, scooters and skateboards without fear of being hit by cars or trams, even in major cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Last year, the holiday standstill was accompanied by a nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Naftali Bennett, Israel's prime minister, has sought to avoid similar lockdowns during the Jewish high holidays this year by ramping up COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, now in the arms of nearly 32% of the country's 9.4 million population.

lifestyle,Zimbabwe artist turns worthless old Mugabe-era banknotes into paintings," HARARE, Sept 16 (Reuters) - If anyone doesn't need reminding that banknotes are just worthless pieces of paper, it is Zimbabweans: more than a decade ago, they watched as hyperinflation obliterated their currency and led to the printing of a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note. Zim dollars were abandoned in 2009, after inflation caused by rampant money printing under the late President Robert Mugabe erased everyone's savings and pushed millions into poverty. Most bills ended up in the trash, but Zimbabwean visual artist Prudence Chimutuwah has found value in the unloved old bank notes - by using them to make art. Chimutuwah wants Zimbabweans to look beyond the ugly history of the inflation - considered by the International Monetary Fund as the worst of any peacetime country - to see something beautiful in the bills. And, in the process, perhaps recover from the trauma of that time. ""A lot of people, when they see the old bank notes, their reaction most of the time (is to) get angry,"" said Chimutuwah. ""I am trying ... for people to see the beauty of these old bank notes. So, when someone looks at this artwork they go like 'whoa' and then they forget the pain this thing has caused."" Her paintings capture the daily lives of women, shown dancing, cooking or in bright and elegant dress, with the old Zim dollar notes stuck on with glue to form part of the image. Her figures are mostly blue, which she described as ""a symbol of strength and dominance"". In one painting, a woman pours a liquid from a calabash, which is made up of pieces of brown 1,000 and 50 billion Zimbabwe dollar notes. In another, a woman wears a mask and blouse made from purple 500 million Zimbabwe dollar notes.

Lopez is the playwright behind the award-winning ""The Inheritance,"" a two-part drama about gay men in New York a generation after the 1980s AIDS epidemic, that opened on Broadway in 2019. No details of casting, plot or a potential release date were given but Warner Bros said that Lawrence Kasdan, the writer and producer of the 1992 film, will co-produce the new version.

Despite being panned by critics at the time, it went on to become the second biggest film at the worldwide box office in 1992, and Houston's rendition of Dolly Parton's ballad ""I Will Always Love You"" became a classic. Houston drowned in a Beverly Hills hotel bathtub in 2012 after a long history of drug addiction. She was 48. ""The Bodyguard"" would join a string of Hollywood movies to get a reboot.

The comments triggered an international backlash, with senior U.S. and British coronavirus officials condemning the claims. Deyalsingh also denounced the statement by the Grammy-nominated artist as a waste of time. ""One of the reasons why we could not respond yesterday in real-time to Miss Minaj is that we had to check and make sure that what she was claiming was either true or false. Unfortunately, we wasted so much time yesterday running down this false claim,"" Deyalsingh said. When asked about Minaj's tweets, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said there was a lot of misinformation on social media. ""I'm not blaming her for anything - but she should be thinking twice about propagating information that really has no basis as except a one-off anecdote, and that's not what science is all about."" Minaj said in a separate tweet that she had not been able to complete enough research of her own on the COVID-19 vaccines to get one in time for the Met Gala, a star-studded fundraiser for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Later, Minaj added that she will get vaccinated to be able to tour.

lifestyle,'The Morning Show' moves beyond #MeToo to COVID and cancel culture," LOS ANGELES, Sept 15 (Reuters) - ""The Morning Show,"" the Apple TV+ The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the show's creators to rework the story for the second season, which begins streaming this Friday. The emergence of the coronavirus became a major subject, alongside other real-world concerns. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, ""The Morning Show"" looks at the lives of people who work on a New York-based newscast and are shaken by a male anchor's sexual misconduct and executives' cover-up of bad behavior. The new episodes pick up immediately after anchors Bradley (Witherspoon) and Alex (Aniston) exposed the network's misdeeds on live television. Now a reluctant feminist hero, Alex takes a break to reflect and try to make peace with her actions, Aniston said in an interview. But she struggles to regroup. ""I'm not as unhinged as Alex in any way, shape or form,"" Aniston said of her on-screen persona. ""But I've met many an Alex along the way in my life, and I remember seeing them and thinking 'don't ever let me ever become that.'"" Alex analyzes her relationship with Mitch (Steve Carell), her former co-host who resigned after mistreating women and is weighing whether he can rebuild his life. Aniston said the show's writers scripted nuanced conversations about sensitive issues and whether anyone can return from being ""canceled"" by a scandal. ""They really address the gray area,"" Aniston said. ""They allow the characters to say the things that are said behind closed doors that they wouldn't dare ever say out loud. And I think it leads to really good conversations."" Bradley finds herself leading the morning newscast, but ratings are on the decline and she is working to find her true identity. ""She doesn't know where she fits,"" Witherspoon said. ""Does work define her? Does her upbringing define her? I think it's pretty cool to have a 40-year-old woman being on this journey of self discovery."" The actress has publicly advocated for equal treatment of women and had served on an advisory board for Time's Up, the group founded to fight sexual harassment in the workplace. Time's Up's CEO and members of its board of directors recently resigned amid controversy over the group's ties to politicians and corporations. The advisory board was disbanded. Witherspoon said she was ""really encouraged"" that the steps would make way for new leadership that can ""continue to grow and strengthen the organization."" ""The most important thing is Time's Up has an incredible mission at its center, to really create equity and disrupt systems that created discrimination and harassment,"" she said. ""It's imperative that it continues because women are still faced with these issues every single day.""

Emotions were giddy as the curtain rose again on top musicals ""Hamilton,"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Wicked"" before packed audiences welcoming back live theater after the coronavirus shutdown. ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda received a standing ovation when he appeared on stage before the start of his Tony Award-winning hip-hop show about America's founding fathers. ""I don't ever want to take live theater for granted ever again, do you? It's so sacred,"" said Miranda, tearing up with emotion.

""I didn?�t think I would be so emotional, but you really felt everything in such a different way coming back in. Being back on Broadway was amazing,"" said Richard Saenz, who was in the audience for ""The Lion King."" Broadway was one of the first institutions to close when the pandemic hit in mid-March 2020 and is the last to re-open in the United States. It has taken months to upgrade air filter systems and ensure social distancing on stages full of blood, sweat and tears. Audiences, actors, musicians and backstage crew must show proof of full vaccinations and wear masks. ""Hamilton,"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Wicked"" were the biggest box office earners, each taking in more than $1 million a week, before the pandemic shut about 40 theaters, throwing thousands of actors, stagehands, musicians and dancers out of work. ""Every single nerve is tingling with joy and world peace. How lucky we are to be back at work,"" ""Hamilton"" producer Jeffrey Seller said on Tuesday.

lifestyle,Masterpiece or monstrosity? Tourists bemused by Arc de Triomphe artwork," PARIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Bemused tourists in Paris reacted with a mix of surprise and disdain when they discovered the Arc de Triomphe monument had been enveloped in a shimmering shroud, a posthumous installation conceived by the late artist Christo. Workers on harnesses spent several days enveloping the 50-meter, 19th century arch in a silvery blue, recyclable plastic curtain, a project first imagined decades ago by the late Bulgarian-born Christo. Dutch tourist Chester Hursman dismissed the wrapping as toilet paper. British visitor Jack Silkstone struggled to work out where the artwork began and ended. ""Wait, so is this the actual installation or are they doing something under it?"" Silkstone asked standing at the foot of the tower. The work, known as ""L'Arc de Triomphe Wrapped"" was finally brought to life by Christo's nephew, Vladimir Yavachev, who last week said completing the project had been a promise he made to his uncle. Christo, whose full name was Christo Javacheff, was known for his larger-than-life installations. He wrapped up a stretch of coastline in Australia and the Reichstag parliament building in Berlin, and strung up a huge curtain in part of a canyon in Colorado. He worked closely with Jeanne-Claude on the projects. The pair covered Paris's Ponf Neuf bridge in yellow cloth in 1985. Tourists will still be able to visit the Arc de Triomphe and its panoramic terrace, which loom over one end of the Champs-Elysees. For a few days during the work, however, it has been closed. ""My husband had never seen it (the Arc de Triomphe) and so I just made him walk two miles and he's not very happy about this,"" Colorado resident Andrea Stutesman said.

I wanted to uplift people and make them feel just that."" Q: Growing up, you followed mum into music but apparently you were too shy to share your music with her? Lennox: ""The bar in my household for making incredible music was really, really high - probably couldn't get much higher. So I chose to keep my writing quite secretive. ""With singing, I was more open with it because I had singing teachers at school. So I was doing a lot of concerts and I was singing, but I didn't make it a point that I wanted to make this my life as an adult. I wanted to work at it and make it something that I felt proud of before I started to share it."" Q: It was quite a family affair producing music with your mum and your boyfriend in lockdown - how did that go? What is Annie like to work with? ""So there's a great level of respect in the studio. We both listen. We both feel that the other person has something interesting to offer and that's worth listening to. We're both perfectionists ... Braeden's a perfectionist too.

The work at Stonehenge, one of the world's most famous prehistoric monuments whose stones date back some 4,500 years, will deal with problems caused by erosion and fix previous repairs which were uncovered by detailed laser scans. ""Stonehenge is unique among stone circles by virtue of its lintels and the special joints used to secure the lintels in place,"" Heather Sebire, English Heritage's Senior Curator for the site. ""Four and a half thousand years of being buffeted by wind and rain has created cracks and holes in the surface of the stone, and this vital work will protect the features which make Stonehenge so distinctive."" The work, which will see scaffolding erected to allow access to the top of the stones, the largest of which is about 30 feet (9 meters) high, will stop existing cracks getting bigger and replace concrete mortar which was used for repairs in the 1950s and 60s with lime mortar. As part of the project, Richard Woodman-Bailey, 71, who placed a coin under one of the giant stones in 1958 during the last major conservation works when he was just eight, will come back to place a newly struck 2 pound coin within the new mortar, English Heritage said.

lifestyle,Byrne sees a longing for an 'American Utopia' as his show heads to cinemas," LOS ANGELES, Sept 14 (Reuters) - While Americans have fought over masks and vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, musician David Byrne said he believes the health crisis showed that people actually yearn for a better society as he envisions in his Broadway show ""American Utopia."" A filmed version of the stage production, recorded in early 2020, will play in U.S. cinemas for one night only on Wednesday. The show mixes ""Once in a Lifetime"" and other songs from the Talking Heads frontman's catalogue with his commentary about current events and humans' need for connection. Byrne is joined on stage by a small group of musicians, singers and dancers. Byrne said the pandemic ""pulled back the curtain"" on modern life and prompted people to stop and think about what kind of world they want to live in. Many people, Byrne said, decided they wanted things to improve. ""To me, that's the utopian urge,"" Byrne said in an interview with Reuters. ""Yes, there's a lot of division in this country in particular. But I think there is an urge to see things improve. And that has really come to the forefront during the pandemic, which is kind of a really beautiful thing."" The film of ""American Utopia"" has been streaming on HBO Max since October 2020. The version heading to movie theaters, which is being distributed by Iconic Events Releasing, will include a new introduction by Byrne and a conversation between him and the movie's director, Spike Lee. The show follows ""a typical someone who happens to be me, from kind of being more or less isolated, a little bit socially awkward and uncomfortable, then finding themselves immersed in a little community,"" Byrne said. ""That little community, by the end of the film, is ready to engage with the larger society and connect with kind of the world at large, which is a huge transformation for this person."" The stage show is set to reopen on Broadway on Friday. Byrne said he had made some changes to reflect the pandemic and the protests for social justice during the past year. The musician said he spent time drawing and writing during coronavirus lockdowns but found it hard to compose new music. ""I'm totally jealous of Taylor Swift for writing and recording two albums,"" Byrne said. ""I wrote some things, but music, I wrote very, very little during the pandemic.

lifestyle,Popular Netflix series sparks new debate over S.Korea's military conscription," SEOUL, Sept 14 (Reuters) - A hit Netflix ?�D.P.?? short for Deserter Pursuit, has been among the top Netflix shows in South Korea since it premiered at the end of August. The series follows military police assigned to capture deserters, shining a light on daily life for many conscripts, including mental and physical abuse from other soldiers. Director Han Jun-hee said he sought to tell a humanising story about how the system makes deserters both victims and criminals, as well as the toll it takes on those forced to do the hunting. ""'D.P' is a story of tracing a deserter, but at the same time, it is a paradoxical story of looking for someone's unfortunate son, brother, or lover,"" Han told Reuters in an email. Asked about the popularity of the show, a defence ministry spokesman said that the military environment has changed and that the ministry has tried to stamp out abuse and harsh treatment. Last week the military announced that even before the series came out, it had planned to do away with the system of having rank-and-file soldiers track down AWOL comrades. That change will go into effect in July 2022. South Korea maintains an active duty military of 550,000, with 2.7 million troops in reserves, amid decades of tensions with North Korea. All men must serve for up to 21 months, depending on the military branch. South Korea's military criminal law punishes desertion by up to 10 years in prison. The Defence Ministry says abuse and desertion among conscripts are down, largely because of a 2019 decision to allow enlisted soldiers to use cellphones in their barracks. The ministry declined to confirm the exact number of deserters, but South Korean media reported that 55 cases were reported last year, down from 78 in 2019. Military deaths by suicide also dropped from 27 to 15 in the same period. HEATED DEBATE The series landed as the country debates the future of conscription and the potential for abuse, particularly as young men facing dim economic prospects have complained of losing time to military service that they could have spent on studies or work. In 2018 a The military has been rocked by multiple sexual abuse scandals this year, prompting lawmakers to pass a law that sex abuse and violent crime in the military will be handled by civilian courts. Reaction to the series among former conscripts has been mixed, with some saying it mirrored their experiences, others saying its depictions of abuse are overblown, and some avoiding the show altogether to prevent traumatic memories from resurfacing. ""There is a scene in D.P. where they throw combat boots (at the soldier). I went through a lot of similar harassments,"" said Ma Joon-bin, who described his time between 2013 and 2014 as the ""dark ages."" ""Now that I look back I feel it was unfair, but back then it was so common."" Lee Jun-tae, 24, who served from 2017 to 2019, said he had never experienced or heard of any of his friends suffering abuse during their service. ""There was no harsh treatment during my time,"" he said. Last week the presidential favorite for the ruling party, Lee Jae-myung, called the stories in the series a ""barbaric history"" of South Korea. Hong Joon-pyo, an opposition party candidate, has said he endured cruelty as a soldier and pledged to consider moving to voluntary military service. Ending conscription won't solve all the problems if broader military culture doesn't change as well, said pop culture critic Kim Hern-sik, who served as a D.P. ""As long as there is military service, whether mandatory or voluntary conscription system, problems are inevitable one way or another,"" Kim said.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 31 year-old Democratic Congresswoman from New York, had ""Tax the Rich"" written in red across the back of her white gown. ""It's time we bring all classes into the conversation about having a fairer country,"" Ocasio-Cortez said about the slogan. Like Ocasio-Cortez, many of the celebrities were first-timers at the Met Gala, including YouTuber Emma Chamberlain, Tik Tok star Addison Rae, musician Chance the Rapper, singer Olivia Rodrigo and ""Game of Thrones"" actress Maisie Williams. Last year's Met Gala was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Monday's gathering was about a third smaller than usual with about 300 guests, with proof of vaccination required, though they did not wear masks while posing upon their arrival.

Nearly 500 items from Stallone's personal archives are being sold, including costumes, props, scripts, notebooks and other memorabilia from the actor's biggest films, including the ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"" franchises, ""Cliffhanger"", ""The Expendables"" and ""Demolition Man,"" Julien's Auctions said on Tuesday. Highlights include Stallone's boxing gloves from ""Rocky III"", with an estimate of $10,000 - $20,000, as well as handwritten notebooks about the first four ""Rocky"" films, priced at $40,000 - $60,000.

""He's a sports guy, that's what he represents, sports and hard graft and people can relate to that,"" Martin Nolan, executive director at Julien's Auctions, told Reuters. ""And that's why he's so collectable and really, people have very little opportunity to own anything from his life and career until now."" Born in New York in 1946, Stallone found fame with 1976 Oscar-winning boxing film ""Rocky"", soon becoming one of Hollywood?�s biggest action movie stars. Asked why the actor, now aged 75, was selling the items, Nolan said: ""He actually is relocating, he's selling his house, so that's a perfect time for anyone to sort of downsize."" ""We expect... a huge response to this (auction) announcement because people have pent up demand for iconic items like this, authentic items coming directly from the man himself."" Other items for sale include posters, the boxing mouth guard worn by Stallone in ""Rocky"", a costume designed by Gianni Versace for ""Judge Dredd"" and a ""Cliffhanger"" arm sculpture. ""Everything is pretty much at no reserve and they are conservatively estimated,"" Nolan said. ""Overall, we estimate the sale in the range of $1 (million) to $1.5 million. That's a conservative auction estimate because they are so iconic and people love this stuff."" The ""Property from The Life and Career of Sylvester Stallone"" sale takes place on Dec 5 at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills and will be preceded by an exhibition of the items in London starting on Thursday at the Mall Galleries.

lifestyle,"Box Office: 'Shang-Chi' Triumphs Again in Second Weekend, 'Malignant' Misfires"," LOS ANGELES, Sept 12 (Variety.com) - Marvel's ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" ruled the domestic box office again, collecting $35.8 million in its second weekend in theaters. Ticket sales for the superhero movie, led by Simu Liu and Awkwafina, fell 53% from its debut, a decline on par with many Marvel installments in pre-pandemic times. Notably, ""Shang-Chi"" is holding up better than ""Black Widow,"" the comic book adaptation starring Scarlett Johansson, which plummeted nearly 70% in its sophomore outing. ""Black Widow"" opened simultaneously on Disney Plus (for an extra $30), while ""Shang-Chi"" is playing only in cinemas. Box office receipts for ""Shang-Chi"" appear to be encouraging to Disney, with the studio announcing last week that the rest of its 2021 slate -- including Marvel's ""Eternals"" and Steven Spielberg's adaptation of ""West Side Story"" -- will all screen exclusively in theaters. The news is especially promising to theater operators, because Disney films are routinely among the highest-grossing of the year and most multiplexes in the U.S. and Canada have been struggling to sell tickets to movies that are also available at home on streaming platforms. The weekend's only new nationwide release, the Warner Bros. horror film ""Malignant,"" was no match for ""Shang-Chi,"" with the twisted thriller debuting to $5.57 million from 3,485 locations. That's a tepid result since horror has been a reliable big-screen during the pandemic, and the film's director James Wan, the co-creator of ""The Conjuring"" Universe and the ""Saw"" franchise, has a solid track record when it comes to cinematic scares. But a bonkers twist ending, as well as decent reviews for the genre (75% on Rotten Tomatoes), weren't enough to entice audiences to watch a movie that, like each of the studio's 2021 releases, is available on HBO Max at the same time. It landed a ""C"" grade on CinemaScore, which doesn't bode well for its future prospects. Overseas, ""Malignant"" made $6.3 million from 69 international markets for an international total of $9.5 million and a global tally of $15.1 million. ""This is a weak opening for a genre that's held up well during the pandemic,"" says David. A Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. ""With the film available on HBO, this start is below average."" To put ""Malignant's"" muted opening weekend ticket sales into perspective, it generated nearly the same amount as ""Free Guy,"" Disney's sci-fi action comedy with Ryan Reynolds, did in its fifth weekend of release. In second place, ""Free Guy"" pocketed $5.8 million from 3,650 venues, boosting its domestic tally to $101.5 million, an impressive sum for an original property. Universal's slasher film ""Candyman"" nabbed the No. 4 spot with $4.8 million from 3,279 locations. After three weeks of release, the movie had amassed $48 million in the U.S. and Canada and an additional $10.9 million internationally.

lifestyle,Wrapping of Arc de Triomphe begins in Paris art installation," PARIS, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Visitors to Paris were surprised on Sunday when strolling up the Champs-Elysees as dozens of workers began enveloping in a shimmering wrapper a posthumous installation by artist Christo at Arc de Triomphe monument. Workers were shuffling around the 50-metre high, 19th century arch setting up 25,000 square metres of silvery blue, recyclable plastic wrapping, which will be on view between Sept. 18 and Oct. 3. Imagined decades ago in 1961 by the late Bulgarian-born artist Christo and his wife and fellow artist Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009, ""L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped"" was finally brought to life by Christo's nephew, Vladimir Yavatchev at a cost of about 14 million euros ($16.54 million). ""The biggest challenge for me is that Christo is not here. I miss his enthusiasm, his criticisms, his energy and all of these things. That, for me, really is the biggest challenge,"" Yavatchev told Reuters. Christo, who spent part of his life in Paris and in New York, once rented a small room near the famed Champs-Elysees avenue after moving to Paris in 1958, when he experimented with wrapping discarded crates and barrels with fabric and rope, according to an official site about the artist. Christo, whose full name is Christo Javacheff, was known for his larger-than-life installations. He wrapped up a stretch of coastline in Australia and the Reichstag parliament building in Berlin, and strung up a huge curtain in part of a canyon in Colorado. He worked closely with Jeanne-Claude on the projects. The pair covered Paris's Pont Neuf bridge in yellow cloth in 1985. The Arc de Triomphe project, involving the most visited monument in Paris that looms over one end of the Champs-Elysees, will still allow tourists to visit the site and its panoramic terrace.

lifestyle,"British monarchy could be gone in two generations, says novelist Mantel"," LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The British royals, who trace their history back more than 1,000 years, could be gone within two generations, writer Hilary Mantel said in an interview published on Saturday. The monarchy traces its history back at least to William the Conqueror, who invaded England in 1066, but also claims ties to the patchwork of kingdoms and principalities which stretched across what became England, Scotland and Wales long before that date. Mantel, best known for her Wolf Hall trilogy that traced the rise of blacksmith's son Thomas Cromwell to Henry VIII's chief minister and then his downfall and execution, said she admired the devotion of Queen Elizabeth, 95, and heir Charles, Prince of Wales. ""I think they do it as well as anyone possibly could, take it as seriously as anyone could,"" Mantel, 69, told The Times. But when asked how long the monarchy had left, Mantel told The Times that her ""back of the envelope"" calculation was just two generations. ""It?�s very hard to understand the thinking behind the monarchy in the modern world when people are just seen as celebrities,"" she said. If her view turns out to be correct, Elizabeth's great-grandson, Prince George, 8, who is third in line to the throne after his grandfather Charles, 72, and father Prince William, 39, would not become king. Mantel triggered anger in Britain earlier this month by telling La Repubblica that England was now a washed-out place that ran on ""the memory of power"". She described Brexiteers as callow and often ridiculous opportunists. ""I'd like people to stop shouting and start listening to each other,"" she said of Britain. ""I think in this country at this time it would be a change that could save us."" Although surveys suggest a clear majority of Britons continue to support the monarchy and especially respect and admire the queen, an opinion poll in May showed that young people in Britain would now prefer an elected head of state.

lifestyle,French film on illegal abortion wins top prize at Venice festival," VENICE, Sept 11 (Reuters) - ""Happening"" (L'événement), a hard-hitting French drama about illegal abortion in the 1960s, won the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice festival on Saturday. The film, by director Audrey Diwan, wowed viewers on the Lido waterfront with its portrayal of a young woman desperate to arrange a termination, at a time when it could mean a prison term or death, to continue with her studies. The movie is set in France in 1963 but its central theme is as relevant today as it was then, a visibly moved Diwan told the audience, just as the debate about abortion rages again in the United States following new restrictions in Texas. ""I did this film with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" she said. The awards ceremony wrapped up the 11-day movie marathon, with critics calling theline-up one of the best in years as many films had been held back because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It is amazing that you managed to make this happen,"" said New Zealand's Jane Campion, who won the Silver Lion prize for best director with 1920 frontier saga ""The Power of The Dog"". ""It is special for us film-makers to be here live with audiences and experience what we dream about."" Stars from far and wide turned out in force on the Venice red carpet - a vital ingredient for the success of a festival, and even more so after last year's subdued edition. Ben Affleck - holding hands with Jennifer Lopez - Matt Damon, Timothee Chalamet and Kristen Stewart were among the Hollywood A-listers who made the trip for the world's oldest film festival. Also creating a big buzz were two films which screened outside of the main contest, and were not eligible for awards -- Denis Villeneuve's remake of science fiction classic ""Dune"" and Ridley Scott's medieval epic ""The Last Duel"". FEMINIST FESTIVAL? Diwan's film was a fitting winner for a festival with many strong women's stories, in a year where the #MeToo movement has appeared to make a mark on the cinema industry. Adapted from Annie Ernaux's autobiographical novel, the picture's tight framing immerses the audience in the private trauma lived by Anne, its protagonist. ""On set, I was always thinking: Let's not look at Anne, let's be Anne,"" Diwan said. She is the sixth female director to win the Venice showcase, here in its 78th edition. ""Happening"" is also the second French movie to triumph at a major festival since Julia Ducournau's ""Titane"" scooped the Palme D'Or in Cannes in July. Among other awards, the runner-up Grand Jury prize went to Italian director Paolo Sorrentino for ""The Hand of God"", his deeply personal film about losing his parents as a teenager.

lifestyle,Company bosses face ethical dilemmas in French film premiering in Venice," VENICE, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The tension between labour and profit in globalised, market-oriented economies is at the centre of French director Stéphane Brizé's new film ""Another World"", the story of a plant manager who is asked by his bosses to lay off his own workers. The movie, which premieres at the Venice Film Festival on Friday, follows actor Vincent Lindon in the role of Philippe Lemesle, an executive at the French unit of Elsonn, a fictional multinational manufacturing firm. At home, his marriage is unravelling because of the pressures of his work. In the office, he is confronted by angry colleagues questioning his values and loyalties as he draws up a list of those set to lose their job. The film is the last instalment in a trilogy about labour issues by Brizé, but the director told Reuters the man's strained relationship with his own family was just as important as his job in ""Another World"". ""It's a story about people who question their commitment, both at the professional and personal level,"" he told Reuters in an interview. While his previous two films on the subject - also starring Lindon - looked at the employees-employer relationship from the point of view of the workers, this time it is the manager and his own inner conflict that take centre stage. ""I wanted to get out of the dichotomy, which is perhaps a little simplistic and comfortable, whereby you have bad managers who do bad things to the nice workers,"" Brizé said. He added that had wanted to tackle the issue from a different perspective, without overlooking the plight of society's most fragile, or seeking sympathy for highly-paid corporate bosses. ""A lot of those managers, a lot of them, were not born to be an executioner, but they slowly find themselves becoming one and losing part of their humanity.""

The movie, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival, tells the true story of the last lawful duel in 14th century France, where two knights squared off in the belief that the outcome of their battle would reveal the truth behind a noblewoman's claim that she was raped. Damon and Affleck, who also star in the film, co-wrote the script, the first time the two actors have worked on a screenplay together since ""Good Will Hunting"", which earned them an Oscar in 1997 and catapulted two unknown twenty-somethings into Hollywood fame. ""The big thing for me about this process was how much fun the process was and how important that is for me and my quality of life and how much I enjoy working with people that I like and love and respect,"" Affleck told Reuters in a joint interview with Damon on Saturday. Damon, who at times interrupted Affleck to crack a joke,  echoed his words: ""It' about working with the people you love. It makes it better."" Damon stars as Jean de Carrouges, fighting to avenge the  rape of his wife Marguerite and restore his family's honour by challenging her alleged attacker Jacques Le Gris, played by Adam Driver, to a duel.

lifestyle,From pipes to musical pieces: Brazilian project makes PVC violins for children," SANTO ANDRE, Brazil, Sept 10 (Reuters) - An orchestra making music from pipes. This is the driving idea behind the Locomotiva Project which converts polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes into violins and cellos and offers free music lessons to dozens of young musicians in Brazil's Sao Paulo state. ""It's a process that takes a bit of work to do, it's time-consuming,"" said Ivan da Silva Oliveira, a luthier who makes violins for the project. The production process consists of 42 steps from cutting and heating the pipe to framing and trimming the instrument. But the savings cannot be denied. A violin crafted by a luthier, who specialises in constructing and repairing string instruments, can cost up to 8,000 reais ($1,540), depending on the wood, Ivan said. Even an average violin is valued at around 800 reais, but the PVC material means the cost drops to around 300 reais instead. After they started making the violins in 2018, this cheaper solution allowed the organisation to wipe out its long list of youths between seven and 17 years of age waiting to receive an instrument. ""It's a PVC pipe that becomes a violin, with which we make music, play, do a lot of cool stuff. This is magic,"" said conductor Rogério Schuindt. In addition to violins, the project also produces cellos and has its own orchestra. The PVC pipes usually used in construction and hydraulic installations are donated by petrochemical company Braskem ""It's a sensational thing, knowing that a pipe that carried water now brings music,"" said Gabriel Santos Espinoza, 11, one of the project's students, hugging his PVC violin.

lifestyle,Venice film awards race wide open after star-studded festival," VENICE, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Paolo Sorrentino's film about the death of his own parents, Jane Campion's 1920s frontier saga and a hard-hitting French tale of abortion are among contenders for the top prize at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday, with the race seen wide open. Film critics agreed the main competition line-up of 21 titles, which included Kristen Stewart's turn as Princess Diana in ""Spencer"", was one of the strongest in recent memory as many movies were held back during the coronavirus pandemic. Outside the competition, and ineligible for awards, were Denis Villeneuve's remake of science fiction classic ""Dune"" and Ridley Scott's medieval epic ""The Last Duel"". Those two pictures bumped up the star-power - a vital ingredient to a successful festival, and even more so after last year's subdued edition. Ben Affleck - holding hands with Jennifer Lopez - Matt Damon, Timothee Chalamet, Stewart and Penelope Cruz were among the A-listers on the red carpet. COVID-19 restrictions meant fans were kept at a distance from celebrities - though Chalamet jumped over a security fence to sign autographs and pose for pictures with a screaming crowd. There were fewer, smaller parties and, with theatres running at half capacity, many attendees struggled to book seats through the mandatory online platform. But the buzz was back. ""I thought the line-up looked phenomenal going in and it has mainly held up,"" said Scott Roxborough of the Hollywood Reporter, lauding the mix of Hollywood, big budget movies with more intimate, auteur films such as ""Reflection"", a Ukrainian film about war against Russian-backed separatists in the east. He said his favourite film was ""Official Competition"", an Argentine satire that rips into the cinema industry and is also vying for the Golden Lion top award. A summary of film reviews by Italian critics on the Lido waterfront gave Sorrentino's ""The Hand Of God"", also popular with foreign reviewers, the highest score. ""Sorrentino looks like a good compromise pick,"" said Italian freelance journalist Paola Jacobbi, a Venice veteran, though she added that much would depend on the quirks of the jury, led this year by South Korea's ""Parasite"" director Bong Joon-ho. Other films praised by critics included Paul Schrader's ""The Card Counter"", the story of a soldier turned card player with flashbacks to the Abu Ghraib prison, and Russia's ""Captain Volkonogov Escaped"", about a state executioner having a crisis of conscience. The award ceremony wrapping up the 11-day movie marathon takes place on Saturday from 1700 GMT.

lifestyle,Bennifer have arrived! Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Venice for filmfest," VENICE, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Looking radiant and holding hands, singer Jennifer Lopez and actor Ben Affleck arrived for the Venice Film Festival on Thursday, getting into a water taxi to be whizzed off to their luxury hotel in the lagoon city. Affleck is in Venice for the festival premiere of Ridley Scott's medieval epic ""The Last Duel"", which also stars his close friend Matt Damon. Once in the water taxi the couple had a brief cuddle as Affleck put his arm around Lopez. Affleck and Lopez, a glamorous duo known popularly as ""Bennifer"", have recently rekindled their romance after almost 20 years. They became the most talked about couple in the celebrity world in the early 2000s, with his-and-her luxury cars and a large 6.1-carat pink diamond engagement ring for Lopez. But they abruptly called off their wedding in 2003 and split up a few months later. Lopez was expected to join Affleck on the film festival's red carpet on Friday evening.

lifestyle,'Like a fairy-tale' - Ukrainian filmmaker's journey from Russian jail to Venice festival," KYIV, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Two years after his release from a Russian jail, Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov will premiere his movie ""Rhino"" at the Venice Film Festival on Friday, a journey he said was ""like a fairy tale"". ""I never thought that I would be released so soon and would be able to finally make my film and be here,"" he said on a video call with Reuters from Venice. ""For me, it is not simply a dream come true, but it also means that I will be now treated as a film director."" ""Rhino"" had been in the works for nearly a decade but production stopped when Sentsov was detained in Crimea in 2014 after Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula. He was sentenced to 20 years in a maximum security prison on terrorism charges he says were trumped up. He went on a hunger strike and his fate became a rallying cry for Ukrainians in their stand-off with Russia over the annexation and Russia's involvement in a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. He won the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize in 2018 while still in jail and was released a year later as part of a landmark prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia. His new film is set in 1990s Ukraine shortly after the break-up of the Soviet Union, a period known for the rise of organised crime, lawlessness and oligarchs. It is told through the personal story of the main character, a violent criminal. Sentsov said it was important to reflect on that period in order to understand modern Ukraine. ""Those times traumatized our country very much,"" he said. ""We ourselves don't even understand to what extent. Many people who have risen during those times now govern our country in this or that way,"" he said. ""They are from those times and the way they see the world is from those times too."" The film was also a way of showing a Western audience what Ukrainians went through, he said. ""They have not experienced any of this,"" he said. ""That is why it is a chance for them to understand us better - why we have such problems, why we can't make such a step forward."" The main character, Rhino, is based on a real person whom Sentsov knew personally. Sentsov wanted to tackle what he saw as a sometimes romanticised view of the criminal world. Rhino is played by amateur actor, war veteran and activist Serhii Filimonov. Choosing from dozens of former soccer fans, convicts, veterans and sportsmen, Sentsov looked for a person with a similar life experience as the main character.

lifestyle,"Film on rape in medieval France reunites Affleck, Damon on big screen"," VENICE, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Actors and close friends Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are reunited in ""The Last Duel"", Ridley Scott's epic drama about the rape of a noblewoman in medieval France which premieres at the Venice Film Festival on Friday. The film tells the true story of the last lawful duel in 14th century France, when two knights squared off to determine the veracity of the woman's claim that she was raped. Damon stars as her husband Jean de Carrouges, fighting to avenge her and restore his family's honour by challenging his old friend-turned-rival Jacques Le Gris, played by Adam Driver. Affleck arrived in Venice flanked by singer Jennifer Lopez, in their first outing at an official event since they recently rekindled their romance after 20 years. ""Yes, I do consider myself a feminist,"" Affleck, who in the film plays an all-powerful, macho count, told reporters. ""It was important, I thought, and interesting to tell a story that wasn't just an indictment of one bad person, but that pointed to the cultural antecedent that Europe and countries colonised by European countries share, which is one that didn't view women for many, many, many centuries as human beings."" Considered as her illiterate husband's property, Marguerite de Carrouges, interpreted by British actress Jodie Comer, risks being burned at the stake by speaking out. Affleck said there were residual aspects of that mentality ""in the disproportionate power that men have in society"" today. The film is divided in three chapters, each one written from each of the three protagonists' perspectives, with some scenes repeating the same dialogues but with the body language subtly tweaked to reflect the different points of view. The film was co-written by Affleck and Damon, the first time the two actors have worked on a script together since ""Good Will Hunting"", the 1997 movie that won them an Oscar for best original screenplay. They drafted in Nicole Holofcener, a director and screenwriter who was a former student of Martin Scorsese, to write Marguerite's point of view. ""We found it in an entirely different process this time,"" Damon said, recalling that when he and Affleck wrote ""Good Will Hunting"", thousands of script pages had ended up not being used. ""One of the things that had kept us from writing for so many years was the way we wrote back in the 90s, when we were 22 and 20 years old, was really inefficient."" This time, the script - based on the book of the same name by Eric Jager - took just six weeks and came together very quickly around Christmas 2018, Scott said. He said the actors had had to shoot a big part of the duel scenes themselves: ""All the stuff on foot is all them. And it was probably the most brutal thing I've ever had to do...that took a lot of effort, six days of incessant detail and violence."" At 83, the ""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"" and ""Thelma Louise"" director said he was still looking for something ""fresh"" to do, and would like to make a musical or a western next. ""The Last Duel"" is screening out of competition at the Venice festival, which ends on Saturday.

Belmondo, a charismatic actor who often performed his own daring stunts, switched from existential New Wave roles in the 1960s to mainstream films and became one of France's most beloved comedy and action heroes. Family members and film figures - including Delon and director Claude Lelouch - gathered in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés church in central Paris for the funeral, a day after a national tribute led by President Emmanuel Macron. Delon, 85, stayed for some time in front of the church, where he was applauded by Belmondo fans massed outside. On Tuesday, Delon told Europe 1 radio that he was devastated by his great contemporary's death. ""We have made French cinema, the two of us, he and I, we are two icons of French cinema, you can't speak of one without the other. We are the same age, it won't be long before it happens to me too,"" Delon said, visibly moved. Through Thursday evening and well into the night, fans braved mixed sunshine and rain to pay their last respects to Belmondo. They queued for hours to be allowed to access the closed casket tribute set up in the sprawling courtyard of Les Invalides military museum, following the ceremony led by Macron.

The 65 works in the Macklowe Collection represent ""an unrivalled ensemble that charts the high points of Western artistic achievement of the last 80 years,"" Sotheby's said in a press release. ""There can be no doubt that this sale will captivate top collectors from around the world and that it will make history as a defining moment in the art market,??said Charles Stewart, Sotheby's chief executive officer, at a livestreamed press conference on Thursday. The announcement is a welcome piece of revitalizing news for the international art market as it rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove down sales and caused layoffs at galleries and dealerships. Sales plummeted in value by 22% in the art market in 2020, according to Real estate mogul Harry Macklowe and his wife Linda acquired the pieces over the course of their decades-long marriage, but a New York judge ordered them to sell the collection and split the proceeds during their 2018 divorce trial. Sotheby's said on Thursday it would offer the Macklowe Collection at two sales in New York, one on Nov. 15 and the second in May 2022. The first auction will feature iconic works such as Warhol's silkscreen portraits of Marilyn Monroe, an enormous tritone painting by Mark Rothko, and a seascape by Gerhard Richter. Other distinctive pieces that will be sold in November include Alberto Giacometti's ""Le Nez"" sculpture of a long-nosed figure in a cage, a painting from Cy Twombly's ""A Scattering of Blossoms"" series, and a Picasso sculpture dedicated to his friend, the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire.

lifestyle,'Dear Evan Hansen' opens hybrid Toronto Film Festival," Sept 9 (Reuters) - The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) lifted its curtains to a live audience for the first time in two years on Thursday with the world premiere of the musical ""Dear Evan Hansen"". The film, an adaptation of the Broadway production, stars Tony Award winner Ben Platt reprising his role as a high school student with social anxiety who gets caught up in a lie. Julianne Moore, Amy Adams and Kaitlyn Dever are among the cast. ""I love the story very deeply. It's been very close to my heart for many years so the fact that it's going so be on such a larger platform and seen by so many is really an exciting gift,"" Platt told reporters on the red carpet. Platt, 27, said he had his own struggles with anxiety and that he had tried to make the character ""as human and connected"" as possible. Moore, who plays Evan Hansen's mother, said she had been a fan of the stage musical for years. ""So to suddenly find myself in the middle of this story - how really lucky I was as an actor,"" she said. The Toronto festival will be a mix of in-person and digital events, screening almost 200 films over ten days. Other premieres include ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"" starring Jessica Chastain as the flamboyant U.S. televangelist,  documentaries about singers Dionne Warwick and Alanis Morissette, and films starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightley and Melissa McCarthy. Warwick, Chastain, British actor Benedict Cumberbatch and ""Dune"" director Denis Villeneuve are among those who will receive honorary awards. The Toronto festival has traditionally been seen as a showcase for movies that go on to win Oscars, including this year's best picture winner, ""Nomadland."" Last year's event was scaled back dramatically, but while  film festivals in Cannes and Venice this year had exclusively physical events, Toronto organizers said months ago that they would move forward with a hybrid model. Films will be shown online and outdoors with some screenings in movie theaters before limited capacity audiences. Attendees must provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test before entering a physical venue. Canada only recently reopened its borders to fully vaccinated American tourists and opened to international visitors two days ago.

lifestyle,"Set of ""Bored Ape"" NFTs sells for $24.4 mln in Sotheby's online auction"," LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - A set of 107 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing images of cartoon apes sold for $24.4 million in an online sale at Sotheby's auction house on Thursday, as the market for the niche crypto asset continues to heat up. The images were part of the ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"" collection of NFTs - a set of 10,000 computer-generated cartoon apes, made by the U.S.-based company Yuga Labs. Owners of the ape NFTs become members of an online club. An NFT is a digital asset that uses blockchain technology to record who owns a digital object such as an image, video or in-game item. While anyone can view the asset in question, only the buyer can say they are the ""official"" owner. Unusually for NFTs, the buyers of Bored Apes also receive the intellectual property rights for the images. They are often used as profile pictures on social media. The lot contained 101 of these anthropomorphic apes, with different combinations of features such as clothing, accessories and facial expressions, plus the option to generate six new ""mutant"" ones. The sale also included a lot of 101 ""Bored Ape Kennel Club"" NFTs - a set of dogs, marketed as pets for the apes. This fetched $1,835,000 and the set of apes fetched $24,393,000, bringing the total for the sale to $26,228,000. Sotheby's allowed payments in the cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ether and USDC, and fiat currency. RAPID GROWTH The frenzy for NFTs shows no signs of slowing. Sales volume on the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, hit $3.4 billion in August, up tenfold from July. Some speculators ""flip"" their NFTs for eye-watering profits within days or even hours. The average weekly secondary market price for a Bored Ape has surged from around $1,500 when they were launched in April to $71,942 last week, according to NonFungible.com, a website that tracks the NFT market. On Monday, a single Bored Ape sold for 740 ether (around $2.9 million). Michael Bouhanna, contemporary art specialist at Sotheby's, said that although there is financial speculation on NFTs, he sees the Bored Apes as works of art. He said the NFT market is not a bubble. ""People were talking about a bubble in March, in June, etc, and then we see that the market is even stronger today so I think they've been proven wrong ... I think it's a very organic market with great collectors who have great appreciation of art,"" he said.

lifestyle,S.Africa's first Black free dive instructor turns tide on apartheid history," CAPE TOWN, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Five youths from Cape Town's Langa township squeeze into wetsuits for a snorkelling lesson with South Africa's first Black diving coach -- turning the tide on decades of apartheid history in which water sports were reserved for wealthy whites. Zandile Ndlovu's Black Mermaid Foundation aims to introduce the ocean to the country's black youth, millions of whom live in impoverished shanty townships, where beach trips are a luxury and swimming skills in short supply. Sitting around Ndlovu, 33, South Africa's first Black -- and Black female -- free dive instructor, the children learn how to bite down onto the snorkel mouthpiece when breathing face down in the water, among other skills. Established in 2020, the Foundation currently pays for the lessons but is looking for funders to ensure its longevity. ""The water space has not always been diverse, and I wanted to create a space where diverse representation in the ocean is possible,"" she said. Ndlovu gave up her own consultancy business which she ran for five years after being employed in the corporate services sector. ""My joy is the moment when one of the kids says, ?�Oh look it?�s a fish, oh look it?�s a starfish,??because it means that they have transcended the fear to actually look beneath the surface,"" Ndlovu added. She was speaking after a lesson in which students entered shallow waters behind a flotation ring in the placid but icy Atlantic Ocean off Cape Town's Long Beach. Before South Africa's first democratic vote in 1994 ended white-minority rule, a myriad of apartheid laws legalised racial segregation across all facets of life. Public spaces, such as bathrooms and beaches, were reserved for whites only. ""I'm happy and I enjoyed it,"" said Somila Tise, a 12-year-old grade six student from Langa as she emerged shivering from the water. Trying snorkelling while on holiday to Bali in 2016, Ndlovu fell in love with the ocean. She swifly got her scuba diving certificate the following year.

lifestyle,Curtain Up! Broadway returns with high hopes and touch of butterflies," Sept 7 (Reuters) - Broadway puts on the razzle dazzle this month after an unprecedented 18-month pandemic shutdown, hoping that Americans have missed live theatre as much as actors and producers. A rousing video promotion by Oprah Winfrey, a television special, refundable tickets, and a week of outdoor performances in New York's Times Square will highlight the 18 musicals and five plays that open over the next few weeks. ""I think audiences are drooling to get back to live entertainment,"" said Ken Davenport, producer of ""Kinky Boots"" and ""Once on This Island."" ""One of the best things that Broadway did over the past 18 months was not try to return too early. That policy has done us very well in making sure we had customer confidence that when we came back, we'd be back for good,"" Davenport said.

""I'm encouraged that as soon as the shows announced (opening dates), people started buying tickets. That gives me hope that the appetite is still there to gather in the dark and tell stories,"" said Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the award-winning musical ""Hamilton."" About 16 Broadway shows are due to open in September, many of them returning musicals or plays that had been running for years before the shutdown. ""That's massive by any standards, even in a normal season,"" said Laurence Maslon, arts professor at New York University.     ""The degree to which they'll keep running, the degree to which shows will find audiences, I think that's a very open question. ""The technical opening of Broadway is a massive achievement... (but) it won't return overnight,"" Maslon added. With many foreign tourists still barred from visiting the United States, producers are hoping that people living in or near New York will fill seats. ""We've seen New Yorkers be tourists in their own backyards. And that is what will drive Broadway forward - New Yorkers and our neighbors in places where people can take a day trip,"" said Brian Moreland, producer of ""Thoughts of a Colored Man"" that opens in October. Moreland said it's likely to be March 2022 before the theatre community can get a solid indication of how things are going. Actors, most of whom have been out of work since March 2020, are overjoyed at returning. Jewelle Blackman, a member of the ""Hadestown"" cast, said the first day of rehearsals was intense. ""I don't think I'd actually mentally prepared myself for what that would be like, walking into a room with people who I hadn't seen, who I used to see every day, who I didn't see for 18 months,"" Blackman said. Despite the challenges, there is excitement and Tickets of up to $700 each are selling fast for the revival of ""The Music Man,"" starring Hugh Jackman, although the musical doesn't officially open until February 2022. ""Broadway is the heartbeat of New York,"" said Jackman. ""I think there is just a great determination that it's going to work and that we're going to make Broadway better. Not just as good as it was, but better.""

lifestyle,Italian film brings circus freaks to Venice festival," VENICE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Circus freaks fight Nazi occupiers in Italian director Gabriele Mainetti's dark fantasy movie ""Freaks Out"", which is competing for the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. Set in 1943 Rome, the film tells the story of four circus performers - each with their own peculiar characteristic - left to their own devices when the city is bombarded and their Jewish boss disappears. The four are a wolfman, a dwarf attracting iron like a magnet, an electric girl who gives shocks to anyone touching her, and an insect-taming albino. They end up in a rival circus run by Franz, a frustrated Nazi with six-fingered hands who can predict the future and wants to use their super powers to help prevent Hitler's demise. ""Freaks Out"" is Mainetti's second film after his well-received, offbeat 2015 superhero movie ""They Call Me Jeeg"", and took longer and more money to make than originally expected, partly because of the strong visual effects. In production notes, he said his latest work was at once an adventure story, a coming-of-age tale and a reflection on diversity. ""We were drawn to the idea of mixing together freaks with a strongly conflictual element such as the Nazis,"" Mainetti told reporters after a screening on Wednesday. ""The characters are frightened and cowardly at first, but then they manage to bring out the best of themselves, and that's their real super power."" Venice festival chief Alberto Barbera said the film has echoes of the works of two Italian cinema greats - Federico Fellini and Sergio Leone. But Mainetti also drew inspiration from Tod Browning's 1932 horror movie ""Freaks"" and 1939 musical ""The Wizard of Oz."" Acclaimed German actor Franz Rogowski stars as the Nazi pianist turned circus manager alongside Italy's Claudio Santamaria, whose hirsute wolfman Fulvio looks like Star Wars' Chewbacca, and newcomer Aurora Giovinazzo playing electric girl Matilde. ""Freaks Out"" is one of five Italian movies vying for the Golden Lion award in the 21-film competition line-up at this year's Venice festival, which ends on Saturday.

While the event is seeing a return to physical shows this season, both brands opted for pre-recorded digital video releases to present their spring-summer 2022 womenswear lines. Designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka chose lime, orange, lemon and blue as well as softer neutrals for their collection, inspired by Bette Davis in ""Now, Voyager"" as well as Italy. Against a recording of lapping waves in the background, models wore designs in an array of prints - floral, butterfly and salamander. There were sparkly trouser suits and sleek evening gowns, some belted at the waist, others adorned with sparkly embellishments including butterflies on the shoulders of one dress. Frocks were pleated, tasselled, sequined, off-the-shoulder or strapless. ""It's about colour and print ... James and I sketched these really pretty butterfly prints and we have a crocodile print. We have a salamander print. We have a turtle print,"" Badgley told Reuters. ""Her coming of that cocoon, out of being so sheltered and so sequestered for her entire life and all of a sudden blossoming on this cruise,"" Mischka added of the line's main theme. Shoji looked back to the Roaring Twenties for his collection, presenting modern takes on the decade's styles with an array of colourful dresses adorned with intricate shoulder cut-outs, lace trimmings and sequined fringes. Frocks were floaty, cinched at the waist or embroidered and came in dusty or bold pink, greens and blues. Shoji also presented a wedding dress made up of a lace top and tulle skirt.

lifestyle,Box Office: Marvel's 'Shang-Chi' Crushes Labor Day Weekend Records With $90 Million," LOS ANGELES, Sep 7 (Variety.com) - Marvel's ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" capped off Labor Day weekend at the box office with a bang. The superhero action adventure, starring Canadian actor Simu Liu, had an even bigger debut than expected, collecting $90 million in its first four days of release and setting a new high watermark for the holiday weekend. Since Labor Day is traditionally a slow weekend at the box office, the film's three day total of $75.5 million from 4,300 theaters blew past previous the record set by 2007's ""Halloween"" and its $30.6 million start. Despite concerns the delta variant would keep audiences at home, ""Shang-Chi"" notched the second-biggest opening weekend of the pandemic, behind only ""Black Widow"" with $80 million. Impressively, it ranked ahead of Universal's ""Fast & Furious"" sequel ""F9"" ($70 million) and Paramount's ""A Quiet Place Part II"" ($48 million), both of which opened earlier in summer at time when COVID-19 looked like it might eventually abate. At the international box office, ""Shang-Chi"" amassed $56.2 million in key markets such as France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. The film doesn't have a release date in China, which is an important territory for Marvel movies. Globally, ""Shang-Chi"" has made $146.2 million so far. ""'Black Widow' showed what a Marvel movie can do in pandemic conditions, and that release had the additional burden of a streaming option,"" says David A. Gross. ""For Marvel, 'Shang-Chi' is a creative departure, and at a cost of over $150 million, the results are very good."" Unlike ""Black Widow,"" which debuted simultaneously on Disney Plus, ""Shang-Chi"" is playing only in theaters for its first 45 days of release before it lands on-demand. Disney CEO Bob Chapek called its theatrical-only release an ""interesting experiment"" and indicated its ticket sales would influence plans for future releases, such as ""Eternals,"" which is scheduled for Nov. 5. Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, ""Shang-Chi"" takes place after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and centers on a skilled martial artist who is forced to confront his past when he is targeted by the covert Ten Rings organization. In a landmark moment for representation, it's the first installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the biggest film franchise, to feature an Asian star and predominately Asian cast. Moviegoers and critics were impressed with the final product; it has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and an ""A"" CinemaScore from audiences. Last weekend's champ, Universal's thriller ""Candyman,"" slid to second place, collecting $10.5 million over the weekend and an impressive $13 million through Monday. The horror film, which is playing only in theaters, has made $41 million to date, a strong result given its $25 million production budget. In third place, Disney and 20th Century's sci-fi comedy ""Free Guy"" finished Monday with $11.2 million (including $8.7 million from Friday to Sunday), bringing ticket sales to $94.3 million. Paramount's animated adventure ""PAW Patrol"" and Disney's family friendly film ""Jungle Cruise"" tied the No. 4 spot with each taking in $4 million over the three-day weekend and $5.2 million through Monday. ""PAW Patrol,"" based on the popular children's TV program, has generated $31 million to date, while ""Jungle Cruise"" recently crossed $100 million at the domestic box office, with its tally currently at $106.8 million.

lifestyle,S.African animator fuses cartoon with reality in satellite debut," JOHANNESBURG, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Self-taught South African 3D animator Lwazi Msipha wanted to create something for both grown-ups and kids, along the lines of The Simpsons, when he dreamed up the character that won him a coveted slot on satellite TV. So he hit on an idea: what if his children's' cartoon character were to accidentally get stuck in the adult real world? That notion forms the premise of 'My Cartoon Friend', which debuted on Cartoon Network in South Africa last month - the first of his compatriots to get a full 13-episode series. In the new show, Msipha plays himself as a young animator experimenting with some new software when he accidentally exports his creation into the real world. He is then stuck with Themba, his feisty, sharp-tongued animation, who he must accommodate into his life - which proves challenging. ""(Our) relationship is like a 'Tom and Jerry' type of relationship. He's a cartoon in the real world, and he doesn't understand that in the real world the dynamics are different,"" Msipha told Reuters TV at this studio. ""Adults can watch it, kids can watch it ??it's basically for the whole family,"" he added.

lifestyle,Augmented reality collection by Ukrainian companies hits runway," KYIV, Sept 7 (Reuters) - (This September 7 story was corrected to make clear that prints were made by foreign and Ukrainian artists, specifies that collection was designed by two companies) At first sight, it looks like an ordinary T-shirt or hoodie, but once a smartphone camera is pointed at it, virtual 3D animation is visible. Ukrainian family-run brand FINCH combined creative forces with the Ukraine-based IT company FFFACE.ME to design a collection of semi-digital clothing - real items that can be ""upgraded"" with augmented reality (AR) and exist both in real and digital worlds. ""By using augmented reality a designer can create items beyond physical characteristics of fabrics or elements of clothing which do not exist in the real world, but can be seen as dynamic 3D objects in virtual reality,"" FINCH co-founder Kateryna Biakova told Reuters. Conceived in 2019, the idea of wearable AR clothing grew from a few items in 2020 to a capsule collection presented at Ukrainian Fashion Week in early September. It featured seven prints by contemporary Ukrainian and foreign artists. Donned in designs by FFFACE.ME and FINCH, models performed in front of tablets which streamed video of augmented outfits. After scanning a QR code printed on an item, an AR layer is activated through an Instagram filter developed by FFFACE.ME, a company known for creating Instagram effects for global companies like Pepsi, Danone, Samsung and Visa. Dmitry Kornilov, FFFACE.ME CEO, said many people are more concerned nowadays about how they look in social media rather than in real life. ""Our message was that fashion production must be focused (on) the fact that the final result of wearing clothes is content production. And our fashion product makes content more powerful,"" he added. According to its creators, the collection promotes sustainability, as one piece may have several digital looks and stand for a whole digital wardrobe. Prices range from $70 to $178 per piece. FINCH says the designs can be used as a communication or marketing tool as they provoke users to engage. The collection will be exhibited in Dubai at Expo 2020, an international platform for innovation, science, and art, which will start in October.

Belmondo, who shot to international fame as a star of New Wave cinema after his breakthrough performance in Jean-Luc Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" (""Breathless"") in 1959, had, for decades, been one of France's most popular actors. ""He's immortal,"" fan Bruno Fougeroux said. ""It's the magic of cinema, you can keep on watching his movies forever. For me, Jean-Paul Belmondo will always be alive."" President Emmanuel Macron tweeted on Monday that the actor, who switched in the 1960s to mainstream films and became one of France's leading comedy and action heroes, was a ""national treasure"". Alain Delon, also one of the greats of France's cinema, told Europe 1 radio he was devastated.

lifestyle,Film shines light on Mexican sweatshops at Venice festival," VENICE, Sept 7 (Reuters) - ""The Box"", a Mexican movie competing for the top award at the Venice Film Festival, takes viewers inside textile sweatshops to shine a light on labour exploitation through the eyes of its protagonist, a teenager boy. The film, by Venezuelan director Lorenzo Vigas, centres around young Hatzin, who has gone to collect the remains of his father, one of countless people who suddenly vanish in northern Mexico only to be found in a mass grave. On his way home, Hatzin stumbles into Mario, a man who looks like his father and reluctantly takes the boy under his wing. Hatzin seems to have achieved his sense of belonging, only to find out that Mario makes a living hiring desperate people to work in the garment factories dotting the barren landscape. ""We are at war with China,"" one of Mario's associates tells the would-be labourers he is selecting on the side of the road. ""The problem is the little Chinese girls have tiny hands and they are very fast."" ""The Box"" is the closing part of Venezuelan director Lorenzo Vigas's trilogy about fraught relationships between fathers and sons. His previous film, ""From Afar"", took the top prize in Venice in 2015. He said that working in factories like the ones shown in the movie, with row after row of labourers toiling on sewing machines and steam presses to make jeans, is the only way to make ends meet for many Mexicans. ""Everyone in the north of Mexico depends on the factories,"" Vigas told Reuters in an interview. ""I am not saying that all the factories treat people badly, but you have factories that imprison their workers, much worse than what you see in ""La Caja"" (The Box)."" Vigas shot the film in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua, where drug gangs are rife and can be easily blamed for the sudden disappearance of those who work in the factories. Senseless violence in everyday life is also a theme in the background of ""Sundown"", another Mexican film screening in Venice main competition line-up by director Michel Franco. Starring Tim Roth and Charlotte Gainsbourg, the film follows members of a wealthy British family vacationing in the resort city of Acapulco, where hitmen come by boat to kill their targets and armed soldiers are seen patrolling the beaches. ""As a Mexican, you get used to hearing about violence every day,"" Franco told Reuters. ""I am very much against the idea of saying it's normal, it's part of our lives. It shouldn't be.

lifestyle,"In 1929 letter, Churchill ponders 'pleasing and profitable' pursuits outside politics"," Sept 7 (Reuters) - A 1929 letter in which Winston Churchill refers to Britain's House of Commons as his ""theatre"" but contemplates quitting politics will go up for auction in London next week. In the type-written letter to his friend Sir Frederick Ponsonby, the future war-time prime minister wrote about pursuing ""more pleasing and profitable"" occupations than being a member of parliament. Months earlier, in May 1929, the Conservatives had lost power in an election and were replaced by a Labour minority government, although Churchill retained his seat as member of parliament for Epping. ""Churchill is thinking about his next steps,"" said Matthew Haley, head of books and manuscripts at Bonham's auction house. ""He is about to set off on a tour of America, a great holiday with family and he writes to his great friend Ponsonby 'the House of Commons has always been my theatre'. So he's not given up on politics just yet."" Many historians view the decade between 1929 and 1939 as Churchill's ""wilderness years"", although he did remain engaged on several issues, including India and the threat from Adolf Hitler's Germany, before becoming prime minister in 1940. He wrote the letter on Aug. 8, 1929 during a trans-Atlantic crossing he took following a debate in parliament about which he said: ""It was evident I was almost alone in the house."" ""You must remember the House of Commons has always been my theatre, and if I cannot play an effective part there, it would indeed be time to quit the somewhat wearisome pursuit of politics for the many more pleasing and profitable occupations which lie outside,"" Churchill wrote. The ship, the Empress of Australia liner, docked in Quebec a day later and Churchill went on a coast-to-coast trip across Canada before visiting the United States. There, he dined with Charlie Chaplin and newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Ponsonby, known as ""Fritz"", was a court figure who had been   equerry to Queen Victoria and joint private secretary to Edward VII and George V. The letter will feature in an auction at Bonham's on Sept.15 and is expected to fetch between 4,000 and 6,000 pounds.

lifestyle,"Turkey cannot recover ancient 'Stargazer' idol from Christie's, Steinhardt -U.S. judge"," NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that Turkey cannot recover a 6,000-year-old marble idol known as the ""Guennol Stargazer"" from Christie's and the hedge fund billionaire Michael Steinhardt. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said Turkey ""inexcusably slept"" on its rights by not suing until April 2017, just before Christie's put the idol up for auction, though it should have known of the idol's whereabouts decades earlier. She said Turkey also did not prove that the nine-inch (22.9 cm) figurine, named for the slight upward tilt of its head as if toward the heavens, was excavated from Turkey after 1906, making the country its rightful owner under that year's Ottoman Decree. Nathan also rejected Turkey's suggestion that Steinhardt, a prominent art collector, ignored ""red flags"" about the idol's provenance. The decision is a setback to Turkey's legal efforts in the United States to reclaim antiquities it believes were looted. Nathan ruled after an eight-day non-jury civil trial in April. Turkey's U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Christie's and Steinhardt did not immediately respond to similar requests. According to Christie's, the idol dates from 3000 to 2200 BC and is one of the finest and largest preserved Anatolian marble female idols of Kiliya type. Steinhardt and his wife paid $1.5 million for the idol in 1993. The idol fetched $14.5 million at Christie's auction, but the unidentified telephone buyer walked away. Christie's still possesses the idol. Nathan noted that the idol had been discussed in several publications over the years, and displayed at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1968 to 1993 and again from 1999 to 2007. ""The Met is a major public institution [and] did not hide that the idol was part of the Guennol Collection,"" Nathan wrote. ""Turkey failed to contact the Met seeking more information about the origins of the idol- a relatively low bar, all things considered, and one that Turkey should reasonably have surpassed,"" she added. The case is Republic of Turkey v Christie's Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-03086."

""Why Can't We?"" features interviews as well as previously unseen pictures. It is curated by deputy editor Stuart Clark, who has known the band since their early days. The group, known for 1990s hits such as ""Zombie"" and ""Linger"", went on to become Ireland's best-selling rock band after U2, selling more than 40 million records. O'Riordan drowned in a London hotel bath in January 2018 due to alcohol intoxication. The group disbanded in 2019. Reuters spoke to guitarist Noel Hogan about the book, which can be pre-purchased in one of two editions, including a hardback copy signed by band members and O'Riordan's mother. Below are excerpts of the conversation, edited for length and clarity: Q: What is the book about? Hogan: ""We know Stuart from way back ... We live here in Limerick and he was a local DJ on a pirate radio station when we started out so Stuart used to interview us, then he moved to Hot Press and he always covered us. So there's literally, there is about 30 years worth of interviews, photos and so on. ""We liked the idea (Hot Press were) going to do everything but they wanted us to be part of it."" Q: Why do this book now? Hogan: ""Certainly, when they brought it to us, it wasn't something that was ever mentioned, maybe that's what kind of sparked this idea. The other side of it (is) the band obviously up until three years ago were a running entity. So I guess you do something like this when you're finished, more so. ""It probably didn't seem like right then would be the time, because things are moving along and you would be doing interviews and maybe, if Dolores hadn't passed away, I think the band was going and (it would be) something you could do way off down the road. So, maybe it's the combination of these things that kind of made them think, 'yep'."" Q: Did you have specific moments or thoughts when helping put the book together? Hogan: ""It's a bittersweet thing for us because you have amazing memories and you realise, God, we did so much stuff. And then it reminds you again that Dolores isn't here and that the band is finished and you don't have that anymore. But I guess we have learned to live with in time the legacy of the band more now, that it's still appreciated. And, I mean, to have that after all this time, it's a pretty cool thing.

""We always write about our reality,"" he said. ""You see something happening to a homeless child in the street, so you'll reflect that in your music. You walk past the Nile and witness the flooding, and the problems our people face that you then try to tell using simple words, simple phrases that can resonate with everyone."" Under its long-ruling president Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted two years ago, Sudan had a growing but cautious rap industry as artists had to contend with the country's security services if they were overtly critical of the government. Venues for their performances were also limited, particularly given strict public order laws. Ijraat now performs across the capital Khartoum, criticising the police, complaining of economic conditions, and referencing burning tires in anti-government protests. ""Happiness here is sold by the jerrycan. Women are hungry and the government is out of it,"" goes one of the group's songs, in a reference to the sale of illegal home-brewed alcohol. YOUTH APPEAL Group member Mohab Kabashy, known as Mo3, says they attract fans looking to express their own issues and those of wider society. ""Problems at home, problems with friends or girlfriends. It then developed when people, especially those of my generation, started to listen to the things I was working on and enjoyed them,"" said the 26-year-old, sitting in front of a mixing board. Artists performing in Arabic and English release albums through dedicated studios and command large social media followings. Large shows have become more common, with artists drawing thousands to venues previously used only by more traditional singers. Although music played a central role in the uprising against Bashir's Islamist regime, Mahdy says many Sudanese still reject rap music as foreign or immoral. ""However, we have faith that when we provide our own generation with songs and discuss issues through music and art, these young people will be able to get to grips with any issue, no matter how complex or difficult it may be,"" Mahdy said.

Luk, owner of the city?�s Paws Guardian Rescue Shelter, takes care of about 500 strays at a time. Luk ends up caring for many of the dogs until they die. He says arranging a respectful funeral for his strays adds dignity at the end of their lives. If he handed their bodies over to the government, they would end up at one of the city?�s landfills. ?�We don?�t want them to end up with the trash. We want them to be treated with some respect,??he told Reuters. The cremations take place at a nearby animal funeral parlour, which charges him a ""symbolic"" fee. Other pet owners pay higher rates, from HK$1,400 ($180) or higher for larger animals. Owners can say goodbye to their pets in a designated room. Later, they can choose to bring home the ashes or have them scattered in a garden at the funeral facility. Joey Wong, who chose cremation for her cat, Suet Suet, said she wanted to spread the cat?�s ashes at the foot of a palm tree on her balcony. Wong said she wanted Suet Suet to have funeral rites, just like a human. ?�She can look back at us from the balcony ??And she can remain part of our lives and be together with the children as they grow older,??Wong said.

""I definitely always have been an outsider in almost every way, literally coming from somewhere else, looking different, speaking different, adapting and surviving through that and also just not being into the things that seemed that everybody was into when I was kind of finding my own space,"" the English-born American-Iranian filmmaker told a news conference. Amirpour, whose 2016 dystopian thriller ""The Bad Batch"" also premiered at Venice, cast Hudson in a role the ""Almost Famous"" and ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" actress relished. ""She was pregnant the first time I met her. I was like 'so, if we can get that baby out then do you want to come and be a stripper?' And she was like 'yeah, cool',"" Amirpour joked at the news conference. ""I sort of found this like a celebration of people who live very hard lives,"" Hudson, 42, told Reuters. ""I think there's this sort of liberating thing to be able to just live as you want and not care what other people think about your choices. And it was fun. It was fun to get into that with Bonnie,"" Hudson added. With Mona Lisa, Amirpour said she wanted to create a new type of a hero who is able to reinvent herself as she moves through different environments. ""That's freedom. That's exciting,"" Amirpour told the news conference, adding that she hoped her protagonist would inspire young viewers to embrace their inner weirdo.

lifestyle,"France mourns 'national treasure' Belmondo, New Wave cinema star"," PARIS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Jean-Paul Belmondo, a star of France's New Wave cinema after his breakthrough performance in Jean-Luc Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" (""Breathless"") in 1959, has died. He was 88. The death of a leading figure in French cinema was felt across the country. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that France had lost a ""national treasure"". ""It seems to me that all of France is sad,"" Michel Godest, Belmondo's friend and lawyer, told BFM TV, breaking down in tears. A charismatic actor who often performed his own stunts, Belmondo switched in the 1960s to mainstream films and became one of France's leading comedy and action heroes. His decision to pursue a career in commercial cinema and to shun the art houses led to criticism that he had wasted his undisputed talent - something he always denied. ""When an actor is successful, people turn their back on him and say that he has taken the easy way out, that he doesn't want to make an effort or take any risks,"" Belmondo once said. ""But if it was so easy to fill cinemas, then the film world would be in much better health than it is. I don't think I would have stayed in the limelight for so long if I was doing any old rubbish. People aren't that stupid."" Godest told AFP that Belmondo passed away at home, adding: ""He had been very tired for some time. He died peacefully."" 'HOOLIGAN'S FACE' Belmondo was born on April 9, 1933, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the son of the renowned sculptor Paul Belmondo and painter Sarah Rainaud-Richard. Despite his cultured background, he appeared more drawn to the world of sport than the arts and was a keen boxer in his youth. Once he had discovered acting, it took three attempts before the Paris Conservatory agreed in 1952 to take him on as a student. Even then it was not a smooth passage, and Belmondo quit in a huff in 1956 after receiving a cool reception for one of his performances from a conservatory jury. One of his teachers predicted at the time: ""Mr. Belmondo will never succeed with his hooligan's face."" Belmondo's reply was an obscene gesture. He went on to star in more than 80 movies, many of them blockbusters, over the next half a century. Belmondo first gained acclaim in ""Sois belle et tais-toi"" (""Look pretty and shut up"") in 1958 and in ""A double tour"" by Claude Chabrol in 1959, where his magnetism stole the film. But his role as a small-time hood who romanced American ingenue Jean Seberg in Godard's ""Breathless"" earned him international stardom. Belmondo's appeal, a mixture of cynicism and sensitivity, warmth and unselfconscious ease, created a new kind of romanticism that brought him roles in the films of France's New Wave directors Francois Truffaut, Alain Resnais and Louis Malle. ""If I have advice to give young actors, it is to never neglect technique: without technique, you limit invention. But it should never show. What counts is the result, not the sweat and the pain it cost,"" he once said.

lifestyle,Argentine satire on film-making lightens up Venice festival," VENICE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The Venice Film Festival got a break from its anguish-filled line-up with Saturday's premiere of ""Official Competition"", a behind-the-curtains Argentine satire about film-making that had the audience laughing out loud. In it, an 80-year old billionaire businessman in search of social prestige decides to make a movie to leave his mark. To fulfil his ambition, he hires the best: maverick director Lola Cuevas, played by Penelope Cruz, and two actors with big talent but even bigger egos. One is a Hollywood star, impersonated by Antonio Banderas. The other, played by Argentine actor Oscar Martinez, is a high-brow theatre purist, with radical views about celebrity and commercial entertainment. From the get-go, the two are on a collision course, and the director's eccentric methods for immersing them in character only add to the tension, making for some farcical scenes. To elicit fear, they are made to rehearse while sitting beneath a precariously suspended boulder. In another scene, the pair are cling-wrapped together for bonding. COMIC RELIEF Argentine directors Gaston Duprat and Mariano Cohn said they wanted to show what happens on set and the tactics actors with different backgrounds use to prepare for rehearsals. Speaking to reporters after a press screening at the Venice movie showcase, where ""Official Competition"" is vying for the top Golden Lion award, they said inspiration had come from the personal experiences of their own cast. Banderas said he once worked opposite an actor who would bellow before a scene. ""The first time he did it, I thought it was a cow,"" he said. He added that it had been refreshing to make a funny movie at a time when ""laughing seems to be forbidden"": a reference to the global gloom from the coronavirus pandemic. The film explores universal themes and emotions, such as envy, under-confidence, competition between professionals and people's relationship with success, he said. Cruz, who also stars in another competition film in Venice - Pedro Almodovar's ""Parallel Mothers"" - said it was liberating to interpret Lola, whom she described as smart but a bit of a ""psychopath"". ""It was somehow a tribute to our profession,"" she said. The festival runs until Sept. 11.

lifestyle,"Willard Scott, rollicking weatherman of TV's 'Today' show 35 years, dies at 87"," Sept 4 (Reuters) - Willard Scott, the ebullient former ""Today"" show weatherman, venerator of centenarians, pitchman extraordinaire and the original hamburger-hawking Ronald McDonald, died on Saturday, his successor on the morning show Al Roker said. He was 87. Scott's chatty, folksy manner covered up his lack of meteorological training during his time as American television's most popular weatherman. Roker tweeted that Scott died peacefully surrounded by family but released no further details. He described Scott as a broadcast icon. Believing television weather forecasters needed to have some sort of shtick, Scott gave viewers a madcap, eager-to-please persona during a 35-year run on NBC's ""Today"" that ended with his retirement on Dec. 15, 2015. Scott was with NBC a total of 65 years. His act was aided by a high threshold for embarrassment. He dressed as Cupid for one Valentine's Day, came out of a manhole in a groundhog costume on Groundhog Day, had an on-the-air bar mitzvah (he was a Southern Baptist) and kissed a pig. Most famously, he went on the air dressed as 1940s dancer Carmen Miranda - including dress, earrings, high heels and fruit-laden hat - to benefit a charity. ""People said I was a buffoon to do it,"" Scott told the New York Times. ""Well, all my life I've been a buffoon. That's my act."" At his peak popularity, Scott also was a well-paid, in-demand convention speaker and ubiquitous pitchman, promoting sodas and tea, oranges, cars, hotels, jelly, hardware and other products. Scott was born and grew up in Alexandria, Virginia, a Washington suburb, and was a teenager when he took his first broadcast job as a page for an NBC station in Washington in 1950. FROM BOZO TO RONALD MCDONALD While working in Washington TV and radio, Scott took a side job portraying Bozo the Clown on a children's show, which led to another clown role that became one of the world's best-known marketing characters. A Washington-area McDonald's franchise owner hired Scott in the early 1960s for ads for his restaurants as the first Ronald McDonald, the hamburger-loving clown. It was a crude costume - Scott wore a food box on his head and had a paper cup for a nose - but the people at McDonald's headquarters liked it enough to take the character nationwide. For the national ad campaign McDonald's hired someone else to play Ronald, leaving Scott to think it was his size - he was 6-foot-3 (1.9 meters) and weighed close to 300 pounds (136 kg) at times - that cost him the job. Scott's success in Washington led to the weather job at ""Today"" in 1980 and his outsized personality, good ole boy demeanor and small-town values made him a fan favorite. Viewers sent him gifts and flocked to see him when he did the weather live from county fairs, parades and civic events around the country. In 1983 Scott wished a happy 100th birthday to a woman on the air, starting a tradition that became one of the ""Today"" show's most popular features. The show received hundreds of requests for 100th birthday shout-outs and Scott did them once a week on the show into 2015, long after he had turned over the full-time weather job. In all, he announced some 40,000 100th birthdays, NBC said. GUMBEL MEMO Not everyone appreciated Scott's on-air antics. In a 1989 internal memo that was leaked to the media, ""Today"" co-anchor Bryant Gumbel said Scott was holding the show ""hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste."" ""This guy's killing us and no one's even trying to rein him in,"" Gumbel wrote. Scott was miffed but popular sentiment was on his side. More than 27,000 respondents to a USA Today phone-in poll said Scott was an asset to the show, with 854 saying he hurt it. ""I work because people know I love them,"" Scott once told People magazine. ""I also know that just the fact that I'm alive offends some people. I'm big, overpowering, flamboyant and loud ... I might put my foot in my mouth five times out of six but the sixth time, I strike a chord and people respond."" Scott, who wrote several books, also was a co-anchor of NBC's coverage of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade from 1987 to 1997 and often appeared as Santa Claus at the White House. Scott and his wife Mary were married from 1959 until her death in 2002 and had two daughters. Shortly after turning 80 in 2014, he married Paris Keena, whom he first met in 1977 at a Washington television station.

lifestyle,"Squeaking, hairless and pink: twin giant pandas born at Madrid Zoo"," MADRID, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Twin giant panda cubs were born at Madrid's zoo on Monday in a boost to conservation efforts for the vulnerable species, whose numbers have been rebounding thanks to an international captive breeding programme. The pair, whose sex is yet to be determined, are the fifth and sixth cubs of Madrid's female panda Hua Zui Ba and her partner Bing Xing, the zoo said. After four hours of labour, the first cub was born around 8:30 a.m., while the second followed four hours later in what the zoo described as a ""peaceful"" birth. Two technicians from China's Chengdu panda breeding base will assist local veterinarians in checking the health of the pink, hairless newborns, who will be totally dependent on their mother for the first four months of their life.

lifestyle,Anya Taylor-Joy travels back in time in thriller 'Last Night in Soho'," VENICE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - British film-maker Edgar Wright said he drew inspiration from the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and Italian horror director Dario Argento to depict the dark side of London in his psychological thriller ""Last Night in Soho"". The film, premiering out of competition at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday, follows Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), a student enamoured with the 1960s who heads to London from the countryside intent on becoming a fashion designer. But her dream fast turns into a neon-drenched nightmare as she finds herself transported back to the decade and inhabiting the life of Sandie, an aspiring singer played by ""The Queen's Gambit"" star Anya Taylor-Joy. Wright, who started working on the idea more than a decade ago, called the film a ""dark valentine to Soho"", the central London area where most of the action takes place. While he asked audiences in Venice not to reveal too much about the plot ahead of the film's release late next month, he told reporters his movie sought to show it is ""dangerous to romanticise the past"". ""I love London, but there's a lot to fear about it as well, so you have a conflicted relationship with the city ... (Bad) things that are happening now were happening then,"" Wright said. The film nonetheless pays tribute to the style, fashion and music of the Swinging Sixties, with ""An Education"" costume designer Odile Dicks-Mireaux helping recreate the atmosphere. Alongside Wright's favourites from the period, the soundtrack includes a new take on Petula Clark's ""Downtown"", sung by Taylor-Joy in an audition scene. The film also features an elaborate choreography of dream-like mirror work between the two main characters, deliberately making it hard for viewers to tell reality from hallucination. ""Having something that requires such synchronicity between not just the two of us but the camera as well, we really had to be focused on the other individual,"" Taylor-Joy said. She said that most of the mirror scenes were captured live on set as opposed to having visual effects reproduced in post-production.

lifestyle,"Critics say 'Dune' movie will thrill ardent fans, may mystify others"," LOS ANGELES, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The much-anticipated movie remake of science-fiction epic ""Dune"" won praise from critics on Friday for its stunning visual spectacle, though some of the initial reviews said that only the most hard-core fans would enjoy the storytelling. ""Dune"" debuted at the Venice Film Festival on Friday and will hit theaters and the HBO Max streaming service on Oct. 22. The movie is adapted from Frank Herbert's 1965 novel about an intergalactic battle to control a precious resource. The book was made into a heavily panned 1984 film directed by David Lynch. Fans hoped that the new movie from Denis Villeneuve would capture more of the spirit of Herbert's work. Starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, the film ""earns five stars for world-building and about two-and-a-half for storytelling,"" said Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman. ""It's not just that the story loses its pulse. It loses any sense that we're emotionally invested in it."" Eighty-five percent of 27 reviews collected on the Rotten Tomatoes website were labeled positive as of Friday afternoon. Some predicted that the movie would compete for Oscars in cinematography and other technical categories. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph called it ""science-fiction at its most majestic, unsettling and enveloping"" and Xan Brooks of The Guardian lauded the film as ""blockbuster cinema at its dizzying, dazzling best."" Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt awarded the movie a ""B"" grade. ""If you're already knee-deep in Herbert mythology, you'll thrill to every whispered word; if you come in not knowing the difference between a Holtzman shield and a hole in the floor, it's a longer walk,"" Greenblatt said.

lifestyle,Maggie Gyllenhaal picks Ferrante novel for her directing debut," VENICE, Italy, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Maggie Gyllenhaal picked an unconventional novel about motherhood for her debut as a director in ""The Lost Daughter"", which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on Friday. In the film, Olivia Colman plays Leda, a middle-aged British literature professor vacationing on her own in Greece who becomes transfixed with a young mother (Dakota Johnson) and her daughter on the same beach. Watching them makes Leda dwell on her own emotional conflicts as the mother of two young daughters years before and the guilt-ridden decisions she made to be able to live her life. The script is adapted from the eponymous 2006 book by Elena Ferrante - a pseudonym of the notoriously secretive Italian author best known for her Neapolitan novels with whom Gyllenhaal only corresponded by letter. Gyllenhaal said that at first when she read the book she thought the protagonist was mentally damaged but then realised how she could relate to her. ""I realized that many people have this experience and nobody talks about it. These are secret truths about a feminine experience,"" she told reporters after a press screening. ""I think that I would be really shocked to hear that there was one mother who hadn't once thought, what if I walked out the door?"" Making the movie was an epiphany for the Oscar nominated actress, who comes from a family of film makers and is married to fellow U.S. actor Peter Sarsgaard, who also stars in the film. ""I think I've always been a director and I just didn't feel entitled to admit it to myself,"" she said. ""I think it's a better job for me actually."" Colman said she had relished the prospect of playing someone who at times does something awful. ""All people want to be one person, turns out they're not that person and they're probably someone else,"" she said. ""It was intriguing to play a character who does something that I wouldn't do, although you do sometimes think about it.""

lifestyle,Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac get intimate for new TV miniseries," VENICE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Actors Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac have known each other for years, but being old friends was a mixed blessing when it came to playing a married couple in new television miniseries ""Scenes from a Marriage"", the pair said on Saturday. Chastain, 44, and Isaac, 42, who both studied at the Juilliard arts school and have been friends since college days, portray Mira and Jonathan in the HBO series, an adaptation of acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's miniseries of the same title. Directed by Israeli filmmaker Hagai Levi, the 2021 version is set in the United States and examines the themes of love, marriage, monogamy and divorce, also explored in the original series, through a contemporary lens. ""This one explores gender roles in a relationship in the current time period in terms of salary ... who is supporting the family ... what it means to be a mother, a woman's relationship to sex, all of these things,"" Chastain said. ""The piece really allows you to look at what it meant to be a wife and mother in that time and what it could mean also in this time,"" she said as she presented the series at the Venice Film Festival with Isaac and Levi. Levi, 58, said watching the original 1973 series as a young religious Jewish boy in a remote village shocked and inspired him. He said he drew on his religious background for the screenplay, which he co-wrote, and strived to depict the challenges ""the new man, softer, more inhibited and complicated"" faces today. Chastain and Isaac described their close bond off set as ""both a blessing and a curse"" when it came to portraying the couple, translating to an easy intimacy and trust but allowing for little personal space. ""We got to the point where we were reading each other's minds and I was like, 'get out of my head!'. I felt on this job there was no quiet time,"" Chastain said. An intimacy coordinator helped put the actors at ease when it came to filming sex scenes, but they were awkward nonetheless, she added. ""I would still get embarrassed. Bourbon helped a lot.""

lifestyle,Kristen Stewart's turn as Princess Diana wows Venice," VENICE, Italy, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. actress Kristen Stewart's interpretation of Princess Diana in ""Spencer"" got a warm reception at the Venice Film Festival, where it premiered on Friday, with some critics already tipping her as an Oscar favourite. Chilean director Pablo Larrain follows a transformative Stewart as the troubled princess reluctantly joining the royals for a three-day Christmas gathering at Sandringham House as her marriage to Prince Charles breaks down. The film portrays Diana as a misfit, increasingly isolated and estranged from the rest of the royal family - with the exception of William and Harry - and longing to break free from rules and traditions she sees as hypocritical and suffocating. Speaking after a press screening about Diana's enduring legacy 24 years after her death, Stewart said: ""I think it's just something she was born with. ""There are some people endowed with an undeniable penetrating energy. The really sad thing about her is that as normal and casual and disarming in her air (as she was), immediately she also felt so isolated and lonely."" Stewart drew critical acclaim for her intense performance, including a posh British accent, with the Daily Mail calling her ""spectacular."" ""Kristen Stewart is Oscar-deservingly great ??and Meghan Markle's going to love it,"" Daily Telegraph critic Robbie Collin tweeted. The actress said that despite the sadness permeating the film she had very much enjoyed embodying Diana, her manners and demeanor, adding however that ""the curtsy went out of the window as soon as I stepped off set."" ""I took more pleasure in my physicality making this movie than I have on anything. I felt more free and alive and able to move and taller, even."" In the film, Diana is constantly late for dinner, often leaves the table abruptly to vomit because of her eating disorder, and grows frustrated and erratic as maids and the palace equerry keep telling her what to do. The royals are referred to as ""they"" or ""them"", and Diana only briefly speaks to the Queen or Prince Charles, preferring instead to confide in her dresser or the cook. In one scene she says she feels like an insect being dissected under the microscope, both referring to the paparazzis outside and her minders inside the palace. Stewart said that as a Hollywood star she could partly relate to the feeling of being hounded and not in control of the situation that Diana experienced. ""I've wanted to run back a million times every day and be like, 'oh, hey, can we actually redo that interview? I just thought about something else for a second, I didn't say the right thing'. Imagine what it was like for her. Imagine feeling backed into a corner, to that extent. At some point you're going to bare your teeth."" Larrain, whose previous movies include ""Jackie"", a biopic about Jackie Kennedy, said he had wanted to tell the story of Diana because it was an upside-down fairytale. ""This is the story of a princess who decided to move away from the idea of becoming a queen because she wants to be herself."" He said he had done extensive research on her, but his film - which includes appearances by the ghost of Anne Boleyn - was a work of fiction, imagining what might have happened during a fateful few days in which Diana decided to get a divorce. ""We didn't aim to make a docudrama, we wanted to create something by taking elements of the real, and then using imagination.""

lifestyle,Director Villeneuve says science fiction epic 'Dune' more relevant today," Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tackling politics, religion, the fight for precious resources and the environment, Frank Herbert's 1965 epic science fiction novel ""Dune"" is more relevant to today's audiences, director Denis Villeneuve said on Friday as he brought his ambitious adaptation to the Venice Film Festival. An ensemble cast led by Timothee Chalamet stars in the mammoth project, set in the future where noble families rule planetary fiefs. Villeneuve, known for ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Sicario"", read Herbert's 400-page book as a child and described it as a ""portrait of the 20th century"" which through time became ""a prediction of what will happen in the 21st"". ""Sadly the book is by far more relevant today about the danger of the blend between ... religion and politics, the danger of messianic figures, the impact of colonialism ... the problem with the environment,"" he told a news conference. ""His book stayed with me through the years, but it just felt ... through time more and more relevant ... I wish it was not the case but I think the movie will speak to the world right now more than it would have done 40 years ago."" Chalamet plays lead character Paul Atreides, whose father Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) takes on the stewardship of the remote planet Arrakis. Known as Dune to its native Fremen people, Arrakis is hotly contested for its lucrative spice, a unique and highly-desired commodity found in its desert where temperatures soar and giant sandworms prey. ""Simply put, this was the honour of a lifetime for me,"" said Chalamet, who on arrival delighted screaming fans by signing  autographs and posing for pictures. Villeneuve's two-and-a-half-hour movie, described as part one of the story, follows Alejandro Jodorowsky's unsuccessful attempt in the mid-1970s and David Lynch's critically-panned 1984 version, a film the latter has described as a ""heartache"" for him after he did not have final cut. Chalamet said he had watched Lynch's version and had ""huge respect"" for Kyle Maclachlan's performance as Paul but wanted to make the character his own. ""I hope we get to do the second (film),"" he said. ""That would be a dream."" ""Dune"", which also stars Zendaya, Josh Brolin and Rebecca Ferguson, will be released in cinemas and the HBO Max streaming service. ""These are of course difficult times for everybody and we all agree safety first, but if the audience feels comfortable and there is a safe environment, I encourage them to see this movie on the big screen,"" Villeneuve said. ""It has been dreamed, it has been designed, it has been made, it has been shot thinking IMAX.""

""Hadestown,"" which won eight Tonys in 2019 for its modern rock twist on the ancient Greek tale of lovers Orpheus and Eurydice, was the biggest show so far to take to the stage again ahead of the return of more than a dozen productions later in September. The musical ""Waitress,"" which ended its run on Broadway weeks before the coronavirus pandemic closed theatres in March 2020, returned for a limited run on Thursday with a new cast headed by singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles. Jewelle Blackman, who plays one of the three Fates in ""Hadestown"", said it felt overwhelming to be back at work.

lifestyle,Trove of missing ancient Mesopotamian artefacts found in Norway," OSLO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Norwegian police said on Friday they had seized a large number of archaeological artefacts reported missing by Iraqi authorities, including what is presumed to be cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia. The objects were found by the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Oekokrim), which assisted Norway's Ministry of Culture in the search. The items had been part of a private collection in Norway, and while several witnesses were questioned there were no criminal charges, a police spokesperson told Reuters. ""In total, almost 100 objects of significance to the global cultural heritage have been seized,"" Oekokrim said in a statement. ""They are now being examined by experts to determine their authenticity and, if possible, establish their provenance."" The police did not say when the items may have arrived in the northern European country, or how they ended up there.

lifestyle,Trash to treasure: Thailand makes COVID-19 protective gear out of upcycled bottles," SAMUT PRAKAN, Thailand, Sept 3 (Reuters) - With an abundance of plastic waste but a scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE), Thailand is turning trash into treasure by upcycling bottles into protective clothing for people at risk of coronavirus infection. Millions of plastic bottles have been collected, shredded and turned into threads to be weaved into fabrics eventually used for PPE, either for hospitals or Buddhist temples, where monks have been cremating coronavirus victims. The effort comes as Thailand has recorded more than 1.1 million coronavirus infections and 12,000 deaths since April this year. ""There are times where it is very difficult to get hold of PPE suits, sometimes even if you have money, you can't buy,"" said Phra Maha Pranom Dhammalangkaro, abbott of Chakdaeng temple in Samut Prakan province near Bangkok. ""But now we're making it out of upcycling plastic bottles, so what's trash is now valuable."" Temple volunteers have been sewing orange PPE suits for monks, undertakers and scavengers, and PPEs are being sent to thousands of temples in need across the country. Though these are not medical-grade, they provide at least some protection for those potentially exposed to COVID-19, and one PPE suit can be made using only 18 plastic bottles. The fabric for the PPEs is being donated by a textile factory in Rayong province, that usually makes fabrics used by some major global brands. At the factory, threads are made from recycled bottles and spun into a giant roll, then weaved into fabric that gets treated to become water resistant. ""This is so that it can prevent particle dust from seeping through and the virus from coming into contact with us,"" said Arnuphap Chompuming, head of sales and marketing at textile firm Thai Taffeta, which operates the factory east of Bangkok. Some 18 million plastic bottles have been used since the middle of last year to make fabric for PPEs, which have been sent to hospitals around the country, he added. The Chakdaeng temple abbot said the upcycling project was helping to ensure more people exposed to the coronavirus were protected, not only medical professionals. ""We're saving lives and the environment as well,"" he said.

lifestyle,Here they go again - ABBA reunite for first new album in 40 years," STOCKHOLM, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Swedish supergroup ABBA announced their first new album in four decades on Thursday and said they would stage a series of virtual concerts using digital avatars of themselves in London next year. Fans piled online to celebrate the long-awaited reunion of one of the world's most successful bands. ""2021 has been saved by new ABBA music,"" @elliemiles23 said in one widely shared Twitter post. The album ""Voyage"" will come out on Nov. 5, the band said during the streamed launch. They released two of its 10 songs - ""I Still Have Faith In You"" and ""Don't Shut Me Down"" - on Thursday. ""First it was just two songs,"" songwriter Benny Andersson said in a pre-recorded video message. ""Then we said 'maybe we should do, I don't know, a few others. What do you say girls?' And they said 'yeah' and then I asked 'why don't we do a full album?'"" The recording went smoothly, co-songwriter Bjorn Ulvaeus said. ""It all came rushing back in a matter of seconds."" ""I knew when Benny played the melody it just had to be about us,"" he added about ""I Still Have Faith In You"". The new album will also include a Christmas song ""Little Things"". ""ABBATARS"" The concerts will be held at a purpose-built ABBA Arena in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in May, and feature digital versions of its four stars Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The ""abbatars"" were created using motion capture technology - similar to that used to create Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies series - and will show members of the band as they looked in 1979. ""The only big problem was that we had to shave our beards,"" Andersson said. The concerts will feature 22 songs, including the two new numbers and a ""sort of a greatest hits"" compilation, including ""Dancing Queen"", he added. Ulvaeus said ABBA had chosen London because the group felt welcome there. ""Somehow, we have always felt that the Brits see us as their own - it feels like that when we come here every time,"" he said. Faltskog and Lyngstad did not speak during the streamed launch. In a statement Faltskog said she had not known what to expect when they got back together to record. ""But Benny?�s recording studio is such a friendly and safe environment, and before I knew it I was really enjoying myself."" ABBA was founded in the early 70s by then couples Agnetha and Bjorn, together with Benny and Anni-Frid. Their initials gave the band its name. They sold more than 385 million albums and topped charts from Australia to America with a string of hits including ""Waterloo"", ""The Winner Takes It All"" and ""Take A Chance On Me"". Their last album with fresh material, 1981's ""The Visitors"",  included songs tinged with the sadness of their divorces. The band split a year later. Rumours swirled for years that ABBA would get back together, but the members turned down many offers, including one reported $1 billion package to tour again.

lifestyle,"Returning to film, Jane Campion says #MeToo was 'like the end of apartheid'"," VENICE, Italy, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Acclaimed New Zealand director Jane Campion, back on the big screen after a 12-year hiatus, praised fellow female film-makers for a string of top awards over the past year, saying the #MeToo movement was like ""the end of apartheid"" for women. Campion, presenting her new film ""The Power of The Dog"" at the Venice festival on Thursday, pointed to colleagues Chloe Zhao - whose ""Nomadland"" won the top prize in Venice last year and went on to fetch three Oscars - and this year's Cannes winner Julia Ducournau. ""The girls are doing very well,"" Campion, the first female director to receive the Palme D'Or in Cannes for her 1993 film ""The Piano"", told reporters. ""All I can say is that, since the #MeToo movement happened, I feel a change in the weather. It's like the Berlin wall coming down or the end of apartheid for us women."" Campion, 67, picked a tale of machismo and revenge set in 1925 Montana and based on a novel by Thomas Savage for her first film since ""Bright Star"", a 2009 biographical drama about poet John Keats, and several years spent working on a TV series. ""The Power of The Dog"", shot entirely in Campion's native New Zealand, stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Phil Burbank, a cruel, twisted ranch owner who sets out to torment Rose, the new wife of his brother, together with her bookish son. Cumberbatch said the toxic attitude of his character towards Rose, played by Kirsten Dunst, was a product of his upbringing as well as his fear of losing out once she comes to live in the family ranch. He said that while shooting he had completely immersed himself in his character. He and Dunst - whose role is amplified in the film compared to the book - barely greeted each other on set to keep with the tense, antagonistic atmosphere that pervades the movie. ""Benedict and I didn't talk to each other on set at all. We always felt guilty if we were like, 'Hi, Hi', we kept our distance,"" Dunst said. Campion's film, which was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, is one of two titles produced by Netflix in the main competition line-up in Venice, together with Paolo Sorrentino's ""The Hand of God"". Both had been invited to the Cannes festival but opted instead for Venice, which unlike its French rival does not demand a theatrical release for films vying for the top prize.

lifestyle,Move over Clooney? Pitt lands starring role with Italy's De' Longhi," MILAN, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Brad Pitt followed in the footsteps of his Hollywood friend and Nespresso star George Clooney on Thursday by becoming a brand ambassador for coffee machine maker De' Longhi. The Italian domestic appliances company said it had launched a global campaign for its home espresso coffee machines with a video directed by La La Land's director Damien Chazelle and starring Oscar-winning actor Pitt. Clooney, who is a long-standing friend of Pitt's, has for many years been the advertising front man for Nestle's premium coffee brand Nespresso. ""Our Group has experienced extraordinary growth in recent years and the segment of espresso coffee machines for households has taken on a central role in this expansion,"" De' Longhi Chief Executive Massimo Garavaglia said in a statement. De' Longhi reported a double digit growth in revenues last year as people staying at home during lockdowns boosted demand for coffee machines, cooking aids and air conditioners. Espresso coffee machines for households count for more than half of De' Longhi turnover.

lifestyle,Italian director Sorrentino turns camera on own family tragedy," VENICE, Italy, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Italian film-maker Paolo Sorrentino turns personal with ""The Hand of God"", a movie about his own coming of age in 1980s Naples after losing his parents as a teenager. Presenting the film at the Venice film festival, Sorrentino said that as he turned 50 last year he had finally felt able to tell the story of his crowded, playful family and how his life was upended by his parents' accidental death. ""Maybe I have made it now because I have the right age. I thought I was old and mature enough to face such a personal film,"" he said. ""A dear colleague told me I never make anything that is very personal, and I thought it was a challenge to grasp."" He added that the fear of tackling such a delicate theme quickly melted away on set. ""I am fearful in life, but in films I am quite brave... here the bravery that was required was a little bit different. The bravery came out in writing the screenplay rather than in the filming."" The film is named after Diego Maradona's description of his famous goal against England at the 1986 World Cup. The late Argentine footballer - who went on to play for Naples in the mid-1980s and became an instant local hero - looms large in the movie. ""I think Maradona had semi-divine powers,"" Sorrentino said half-jokingly, adding that one of his biggest regrets was not to have been able to show the film to the footballer, who died last year. Sorrentino, who was 17 at the time, was in Naples to see Maradona play on the night his parents were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning at the family's ski house. He gave the role of his father to Toni Servillo, a long-time collaborator, while his young self is played by Italian newcomer Filippo Scotti, who he said displayed ""that same shyness and awkwardness that I remember having as a 17-, 18-year-old lad."" Servillo, one of Italy's most acclaimed actors who has worked with Sorrentino for the past 20 years, said he was moved to play the director's dad, but added that despite the painful memories, the atmosphere on the set was at times hilarious -- and the film is peppered with outright funny scenes.

The five-day festival, traditionally held in March, was cancelled last year as the COVID-19 pandemic struck Spain. The start of this year's event had to be postponed until Sept. 1 due to many restrictions in place earlier this year. ""Being in the street again is to win the game against COVID, with all the safety measures and working hard so that there are no infections, we hope that the festival makes us regain a little joy,"" said Jaime Bronchud, one of the organisers. Masks are compulsory and the fiesta must be over by 1 a.m. With few tourists around, organisers expected little of the usual revelry in the streets, but said getting their Fallas groups back together made for a joyous occasion regardless. Months of painstaking work go into constructing the ""ninots"", Valencian for dolls, some reaching soaring heights only to be burned to the ground in an explosive finale. They are made of materials such as wood, plaster and paper mache. At least one large ninot ensemble collapsed on Tuesday night due to a storm that hit eastern Spain, leaving crushed plaster birds and angels on the ground and baring the damaged wooden structure. ""It's very tough,"" said fallera Alba Miquel, crying. ""With everything that we've been through with the coronavirus, now this fall,"" she said. The festival is dedicated to Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters. Hundreds of sculptures, often satirical effigies of politicians and celebrities, are exhibited for the public to vote on their favourite, with only two saved from the bonfire to join fellow survivors at the local Fallas Museum.

""Know Your Rights and Claim Them"" - written with human rights lawyer Geraldine Van Bueren, one of the original drafters of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - aims to equip kids with the knowledge to safely challenge injustices. ""So many children are in harm's way across the world and we're simply not doing enough,"" Jolie told Reuters in an interview. ""These are their rights, decided years ago based on what would make them healthy, balanced, safe and stable adults."" Jolie, special envoy for UN refugee agency UNHCR, said she hoped the book would also remind governments of their commitment to the global treaty enshrining children's civil, social, political and economic rights. ""We spent a lot of time blocking those rights, so this book is to help the kids have a tool book to say 'these are your rights, these are things you need to question to see how far you, depending on your country and circumstance, are from accessing those rights, what are your obstacles, others that came before you and fought, ways you can fight'. So it's a handbook to fight back."" The mother-of-six said she put up the U.N convention in her home for her children, but was surprised to learn her own country, the United States, has not ratified it. ""That infuriated me and made me start to question what does that mean? So for each country, what is this idea of, you have the right to an education ... but then why is it so many children are out of school? Why is it the girls in Afghanistan are being harmed if they go?"" she said. HOW TO BE AN ACTIVIST The book addresses identity, justice, education and protection from harm, among other issues. It provides guidance on becoming an activist, being safe and a glossary of terms and organisations. ""Through the book, you have to find your own path forward, because we are very concerned about the safety of children. We don't want children just running around screaming for their rights and putting themselves in danger,"" Jolie said. The book is peppered with examples of powerful young voices from around the world, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, climate activist Greta Thunberg and 15-year-old  Palestinian journalist Janna Jihad. ""I was trying to ... show the world what Palestinian children face on a daily basis,"" Jihad, who lives in the village of Nabi Salih, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, told Jolie and other young activists in a video call, attended by Reuters, where they discussed their campaign work.

The book is out in Britain on Thursday and for pre-order in other countries, with the aim of worldwide publication. ""We're going to find that some adults in some countries are going to block the book and the children will find it so I think that's how it's going to reach more children,"" Jolie said.

Unlike rival Cannes, the world's oldest film festival did not skip the 2020 edition due to the health crisis but it is only this year that celebrities are returning in force to the Lido waterfront, in a show of support for an industry hammered by lockdowns. Organisers are banking on a strict anti-COVID protocol to help keep the 11-day movie marathon trouble free. Theatres are operating at half capacity and a wall blocks the view to the red carpet to stop crowds from gathering outside the main venue. Face masks and a health pass or a negative COVID test are required to attend screenings, and there will be fewer late-night parties. ""They are taking measures really seriously. Everyone is being really careful, really responsible. I think it's great for the industry that things can start to come back,"" Cruz told Reuters ahead of the opening ceremony. ""I am happy that it's happening. It's a celebration of cinema but it also gives jobs to a lot of people around the world."" Cruz stars in ""Parallel Mothers"", the festival's opening film by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. Hollywood stars Kirsten Dunst, Timothee Chalamet, Matt Dillon and Maggie Gyllenhaal are also among those who have made the trip to Venice so far. ""Everybody everywhere is eager to come back, to reopen, to restart, to release the films that stayed on the shelf for a year and a half or maybe two years,"" festival director Alberto Barbera told Reuters. He said most of the world premieres to be screened at the festival were already sold out, and promised that there would be no shortage of celebrities - even though fans will not be able to get anywhere near them. ""The red carpet will be one of the most crowded in years because everybody is here,"" he said. Titles vying for the Golden Lion award for best film include Jane Campion's ""The Power of the Dog"", with Benedict Cumberbatch as a ranch owner who torments a young widow played by Dunst, and Kristen Stewart's turn as Princess Diana in ""Spencer"".

lifestyle,UK regulator clears broadcaster over Piers Morgan's Meghan comments," LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - High-profile television personality Piers Morgan did not breach Britain's broadcasting code in his criticism of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" show earlier this year, Britain's media regulator ruled on Wednesday. The programme in March, in which Morgan said he did not believe a word Meghan had said in a landmark interview she and her husband Prince Harry gave to Oprah Winfrey, attracted more than 50,000 complaints. Most concerned comments Morgan made on mental health and suicide. Meghan, who during the Winfrey interview revealed she had felt suicidal while living as a royal in Britain,complained to both Ofcom and ITV about the programme. Morgan left his jobon the show following the incident. ""Our decision is that overall the programme contained sufficient challenge to provide adequate protection and context to its viewers,"" Ofcom said. In an interview that shook Britain's monarchy, Meghan, a Hollywood actor who married Prince Harry in 2018, said the royal family had also rejected her pleas for mental health support. The couple have stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States. Morgan, a former presenter on CNN, has accused the couple of damaging the royal family and seeking publicity on their own terms without accepting the responsibility and scrutiny that come with their position. He had also dubbed her ""Princess Pinocchio"" in a tweet. ""I'm delighted OFCOM has endorsed my right to disbelieve the Duke & Duchess of Sussex?�s incendiary claims to Oprah Winfrey, many of which have proven to be untrue,"" Morgan said on Twitter. ""This is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios. Do I get my job back?"" A U.S.-based spokesperson for the Sussexes was not immediately available for comment out of working hours. Ofcom said that while it was concerned about Morgan's apparent disregard for the seriousness of anyone expressing suicidal thought, the extensive challenge offered by his colleagues throughout the show provided sufficient context. The broadcasting code allows for individuals to express strongly held and robustly argued views, including those that are potentially harmful or highly offensive, Ofcom said. ""The restriction of such views would, in our view, be an unwarranted and chilling restriction on freedom of expression both of the broadcaster and the audience,"" it said.

lifestyle,Almodovar opens Venice film fest with tribute to those who disappeared under Franco," VENICE, Italy, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Spanish director Pedro Almodovar shines a spotlight on the tens of thousands of people who disappeared during the civil war and Franco's dictatorship in his latest film ""Parallel Mothers"", which opens the Venice film festival on Wednesday. The film, starring Penelope Cruz as one of two women giving birth in the same Madrid hospital on the same day, is a reflection on motherhood and the importance of family ties. But it also dwells on a painful chapter of Spanish history that the country is still struggling to come to terms with. Almost 50 years after the death of General Francisco Franco, more than 100,000 victims of summary executions during the 1936-39 civil war and the authoritarian rule that followed remain buried in unmarked mass graves dotted all over Spain. The majority were Republicans or leftist sympathisers killed by fascist forces, and their relatives seeking a dignified closure have often received little help from Spanish authorities to locate and excavate their remains. ""I wanted to give this topic visibility, and I believe that in Spain after 85 years, until we've paid this debt we owe to the 'desaparecidos', we will not be able to close the chapter of our recent history,"" Almodovar told reporters. He said Spain was still reluctant to confront its troubled and divisive past, despite some steps taken by the government in recent years to fund the locating of mass graves and the identification of the dead. ""We can't just close our eyes in front of what happened,"" the 71-year old Oscar-winning film-maker said after a press screening ahead of the official presentation on Wednesday. In the film, Cruz plays Janis, a single woman near her forties who unexpectedly falls pregnant - just like teenager Ana, whom Janis meets in hospital on the day they are each due to give birth to a baby girl. Their lives become increasingly intertwined when the man Janis had an affair with asks for a paternity test, while she also looks for help to exhume the body of her great-grandfather, murdered by Franco's forces. Cruz, an Almodovar favourite who says she decided to become an actress after seeing one of his films at 16, said Janis was her most complex character so far and she felt very privileged to work once again with the film-maker who helped make her a celebrity. ""I feel like the luckiest girl in the world, being able to work with him for so many years, seven different projects and so many different characters.

lifestyle,"Below a pyramid, a treasure trove sheds new light on ancient Mexican rites"," TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico, Sept 1 (Reuters) - More than a decade after Sergio Gomez began excavating a tunnel under a towering Mexican pyramid, the archeologist still spends most of his time studying the massive cache of sacred artifacts carefully placed there by priests some 2,000 years ago. The volume and variety of objects hidden in the sealed tunnel under Teotihuacan's ornate Feathered Serpent Pyramid has shattered records for discoveries at the ancient city, once the most populous metropolis of the Americas and now a top tourist draw just outside modern-day Mexico City. Over 100,000 artifacts from the tunnel have been cataloged so far, ranging from finely-carved statues, jewelry, shells, and ceramics as well as thousands of wooden and metallic objects that mostly survived the passage of time intact. On a recent tour of the tunnel and conservation workshops where his 30-member team pores over the trove, Gomez showed off some of the dig's most spectacular and until now unreported finds - all part of ceremonial offerings left along the 100-meter-long (330 ft) tunnel, which ended in three chambers directly under the pyramid's mid-point. ""Can you see it?"" Gomez asked, shining the light of his cellphone on a tennis-ball-sized carved amber sphere he picked up from a workshop table. Illuminated, it looks like molten lava. It is the first time an ornament made from amber has turned up in Teotihuacan. Found with a small top and residue inside that awaits further analysis - Gomez speculates it may be tobacco - it likely hung around a priest's neck. As in other ancient Mexican societies, the priests who entered the tunnel likely ingested hallucinogenic plants or mushrooms as part of rituals, Gomez said. The tunnel, which is tall enough in most places to walk through and is around 12 meters (40 ft) underground, was designed to dazzle, he explained. The walls and even the floor were coated with fine bits of iron pyrite, popularly known as fool's gold due to its resemblance to the precious metal. ""We can imagine when the priests entered with a torch how it would have sparkled as the flame moved,"" said Gomez, who believes the tunnel was made to recreate the underworld of their cosmovision and used to initiate new rulers. Scientific dating shows that the damp, never-looted space was in use for more than two centuries through 250 A.D. Teotihuacan, a wealthy contemporary of ancient Rome and Han China, thrived from about 100 B.C. to 550 A.D. and was home to up to 200,000 people mostly living in multi-family stone compounds painted with colorful murals. Much is unknown about them, including what language they spoke and whether they developed a system of FINAL DISCOVERY Walking through the now-empty tunnel, Gomez stops where a large offering was found. He describes 17 separate layers of shells meticulously laid down by priests, one on top of the other, with the bottom layers crushed. ""But that's because they themselves were stepping on them,"" he said. Gomez stresses that his dozen-year excavation of the tunnel, which had filled with mud over the centuries, was equally meticulous, so much so that bits of human hair and even skin were likely recovered. It appears that ceremonies in the tunnel involved the offering of gifts to the lords of the underworld, and to the city's main deity, the storm god. Several dozen nearly-identical shiny black jars sculpted to resemble the latter have been discovered. Among the richest offerings are hundreds of objects made of so-called imperial jade, one of the world's most expensive gems, including ear spools, necklaces and pendants - one in the form of a crocodile. Several thousand once-glittering iron pyrite pieces were unearthed. Possibly imported from as far away as Honduras, they include beads, disks and even the bottom half of a cup. Around 8,000 wooden objects - plates, bowls and more - were unearthed, as well as the skulls and claws of some three dozen animal species, especially predators like jaguars and pumas. Beyond traditional restoration work, Gomez's team is also developing three-dimensional digital recreations of the artifacts as they originally would have appeared, so they can eventually be accessed online. The final physical discovery made in late July proved especially satisfying for Gomez. In a circular pit carved into the tunnel floor previously missed by laser scans, priests had tossed four bunches of flowers. On top, they placed a heap of wood, handfuls of corn, chile, and nopal seeds, plus a miniature stone carved pyramid. Finally, they set it all on fire. Thanks to the charred wood, Gomez will soon be able to pinpoint the year the smoky ritual took place. The flowers were unprecedented, the first time intact plant remains have been found at Teotihuacan. ""It's just so unique,"" he said, hunching down just off the pit, wiping his brow. ""It makes you feel so close to the people who were here.""

Big John roamed the lands of modern-day South Dakota more than 66 million years ago. Paleontologists unearthed the first piece of bone in 2014 and eventually found 60% of his skeleton, including a near-complete skull. The Drouot auction house estimated Big John's skeleton would fetch between 1.2 - 1.5 million euros. Once primarily sold to museums, dinosaur remains have increasingly attracted private buyers, though their numbers remain few. ""I imagine there are about 10 buyers worldwide for this kind of piece,"" said Alexandre Giquello, who is leading the sale. The skull of Big John, named after the owner of the land where more than 200 of the dinosaur's bones were found, is 2.62 metres in length - nearly a third of his overall bodylength - and two metres wide. The name triceratops means 'three-horned face'. In the fossilised remains of his bony frill is a gaping hole, a battle scar inflicted by a smaller rival according to paleontologist Iacopo Briano.

lifestyle,Thinking out of the box: Japanese artist makes life-like cardboard sculptures," TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Using a long pair of tweezers, Monami Ohno delicately places tiny cardboard ""scales"" on the legs of her sculpture of Godzilla, the giant reptile from the classic Japanese movie. Over the past decade, the Japanese artist has used the unlikely medium of cardboard to create artwork inspired by popular culture, from anime robots to models of tanks and fighter jets, a life-sized gun to a full McDonald's meal. It all started when the 29-year-old made a ""bike-like thing"" out of cardboard for a college assignment ten years ago. ""When I first tried folding the paper, gluing and putting them together, the people around me praised me, saying things like 'Wow, you can make this,',"" she said. ""That made me so happy that I have continued doing this until now."" Ohno's intricate sculptures have since gained popularity, with her work exhibited in galleries in Japan and overseas. Rather than relying on a precise blueprint, Ohno simply draws a rough sketch on the cardboard to get an idea of the measurements before cutting out the design and moulding it, using glue and sometimes a little water. ""I make the things I would really like to decorate my house with,"" she said in her studio filled with her creations, including a child-sized Lego Batman sculpture. Ohno's commissioned pieces have sold for 100,000 yen  ($909.42) to 1,500,000 Japanese yen, according to her press officer. Although her art is entirely made from used cardboard boxes, Ohno said her work has no underlying environmental message.

lifestyle,"Actor Ed Asner, star of 'Mary Tyler Moore,' 'Lou Grant' dies at age 91"," Aug 29 (Reuters) - Ed Asner, who played a gruff newsman for laughs and for drama in the classic TV series ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and its spinoff ""Lou Grant"" in the 1970s and 1980s and was honored with seven Emmy Awards, died on Sunday at age 91, his family said. Asner, whose diverse credits also included a key voice role in the acclaimed 2009 animated film ""Up,"" died at his home surrounded by his family, his publicist told media outlets. His family confirmed the death on the actor's Twitter feed, writing, ""We are sorry to say that our beloved patriarch passed away this morning peacefully."" ""Words cannot express the sadness we feel. With a kiss on your head- Goodnight dad. We love you,"" his family said. Asner was known for his liberal politics and his stint as Screen Actors Guild president in the 1980s when he criticized U.S. involvement in Central America during the administration of a previous head of the actors' union, President Ronald Reagan. In a career of remarkable longevity, Asner acted into his 90s. Asner was integral to the success of the situation comedy ""Mary Tyler Moore,"" which ran on CBS from 1970 to 1977 and boasted one of the best assemblages of actors and writers in U.S. TV history. Moore starred as Mary Richards, an associate producer for a local TV news operation in Minneapolis. The short, barrel-shaped Asner played her brusque and irascible boss, Lou Grant. In the first episode, Moore's character interviews for a job with Asner's Grant but objects to prying questions about her religion and marital status. ""You know what, you've got spunk,"" Asner tells Moore, who mistakenly takes it as a compliment. ""Well, yes,"" she replies. ""I hate spunk,"" snaps Asner, who hires her anyway. Asner was not known as a comic actor before landing the ""Mary Tyler Moore"" role but demonstrated deft comic timing in working with a cast that included Ted Knight, Betty White, Valerie Harper, Gavin MacLeod and Cloris Leachman. ""I didn't really put my toe into the water of comedy until I went up to read for 'Mary Tyler Moore.' I was afraid of it,"" Asner said in a 1995 Montreal radio interview. ""Not that I couldn't do an initial spark of humor but I didn't know how to maintain it."" The series ran for seven years and won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series three straight years starting in 1975. Asner won three Emmys for his work on the show. ""Mary Tyler Moore"" spawned a number of spinoff series. After the show ended, Asner brought his Lou Grant character to a series of his own. Whereas ""Mary Tyler Moore"" was a fun sitcom, the new show, ""Lou Grant,"" was a drama with Asner's character relocated to Los Angeles to become city editor of a daily newspaper. CANCELLATION CONTROVERSY The series ran from 1977 to 1982 as Asner became the first actor to win an Emmy - two of them, in fact - playing the same character in both a comedy and a drama. Asner asserted that ""Lou Grant"" was canceled by CBS due to his outspoken political views, not due to ratings. ""I have no proof. But most insiders seem to think that the show would not have been canceled had it not been for the controversy that arose over my stand on El Salvador,"" Asner said in an interview for the Archive of American Television. As head of the actors' union from 1981 to 1985, Asner also clashed with conservative actor Charlton Heston. Asner also won Emmys for his work in two miniseries - ""Roots"" in 1977 and ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" in 1976 - and his total of seven was more than any other male actor. He was nominated for an Emmy 20 times. Later in his career, Asner became a successful voice actor for animated TV shows and films and played Santa Claus in several projects, including the 2003 Will Ferrell comedy ""Elf."" In the sentimental 2009 animated film ""Up,"" Asner provided the voice for the main character, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen, who after the death of his beloved wife ties balloons to his house and floats off to fulfill his fantasy of exploring South America, only to find he has a youthful stowaway. The movie won an Oscar for best animated film and a nomination for best picture. Asner remained a busy actor into his 90s with appearances in such series as ""Dead to Me"" and ""Cobra Kai."" Asner, born in 1929, became a regular on television and later the movies starting in the 1950s. Before their series began, he acted alongside Moore in the Elvis Presley movie ""Change of Habit"" (1969). Asner also appeared in the film ""They Call Me Mister Tibbs!"" (1970) with Sidney Poitier. Asner also was instrumental in the 2017 creation of the Ed Asner Family Center, founded by his son and his daughter in law, to help children with special needs and their families.

lifestyle,Dragons fly as Chinese millennials take a shine to gold," SHANGHAI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - For many affluent young Chinese consumers, modern simplicity is out and tradition is back in when it comes to jewellery. Sales of gold bracelets, pendants, earrings and necklaces that draw on dragons, phoenixes, peonies and other traditional Chinese patterns and symbols are flying among consumers, especially those in their 20s and 30s, helping drive a rebound in gold demand in the country after a pandemic-induced slump. An e-commerce boom and national pride are fuelling the rise in demand for what is known as heritage gold jewellery, which requires intricate craftsmanship and can command premiums of 20% or more over conventional gold jewellery, industry executives say. The popularity of these new pieces began to take off in mid-2020 and helped gold jewellery demand in China - the world's top consumer of the metal - more than double in the first half of 2021 from a year earlier to pre-pandemic levels, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). A strengthening economy and improving consumer spending are helping sales. Young consumers' interest in the classic designs and often chunky gold jewellery with a matte finish marks a turnaround in their appetite for the precious metal, previously eschewed as an ostentatious sign of wealth and status symbol for older generations. It also provides a boost for gold at a time when demand from India, the world's second-largest consumer, has been hit as the pandemic delayed weddings, where gold is traditionally included in the dowry. Major Chinese jewellery retailers like Hong Kong-listed Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd Chow Tai Fook, China's largest jeweller by market value, said its heritage gold collection accounted for 40% of the total value of its retail sales of gold products in mainland China in its fiscal year-ended March 2021 - up from 29% the previous year, faster growth than for other jewellery. Part of heritage gold jewellery's appeal, especially among young consumers, reflects a desire to be patriotic amid a backlash against Western apparel brands in China that expressed concern over allegations of rights abuses in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Beijing has denied the allegations. ""The younger generation grew up when China's economy was stronger, they have more confidence in Chinese development and may have less admiration for Western culture,"" said Roland Wang, managing director of WGC China. ""They want to have more traditional Chinese culture in their daily life, which can be represented through what they wear or how they decorate their home... Heritage gold can deliver this."" Gao, a 29-year-old sales executive from eastern Jiangsu province, who only wanted to be identified by a single name, says she has spent 30,000 yuan ($4,620.15) this year on a bracelet and hairpin, featuring filigree patterns, for everyday use. She plans to pass them on to her two-year old daughter one day. ""I really like Chinese culture and prefer products with Chinese history. I often wear (traditional) Han-style clothing, which is why I choose heritage gold, to match my overall look,"" Gao said. Jewellers say the products are increasingly popular with millennials in Beijing, Shanghai and other big cities too and a boom in e-commerce, giving consumers access to much greater choice of jewellery products, is reinforcing the trend. ""The pandemic indeed made me spend more on gold jewellery... It sparked a lot of live-streaming sales,"" said Gao. GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY In anticipation of longer-term demand, gold jewellery manufacturers are stepping up investment in heritage gold. A manager at a Shenzhen-based manufacturer, who declined to be identified as he was unauthorized to speak to the media, said his firm is mainly promoting heritage gold this year after receiving large orders from major brands and customers. ""Heritage gold sales were amazing this Lunar New Year holiday, surpassing that of conventional gold jewellery,"" he said. ""After seeing this trend, our company expanded research and development on design and technology to create more new designs of heritage gold. Other gold jewellery manufacturers in Shenzhen are doing the same."" The China Gold Association says heritage gold jewellery has become the main driving force in the industry's recovery from the impact of the pandemic. And fast growth looks set to continue. According to industry and market research consultancy Beijing Zhiyan Kexin Consulting, the market for heritage gold in China increased tenfold between 2017 and 2019, and is seen reaching nearly 100 billion yuan ($15.43 billion) by 2024. Its share of China's gold jewellery market is forecast to jump from less than 2% in 2017 to nearly a quarter by 2024. ""Gold jewellery enterprises are rapidly recognising the importance of cultural value and are digging deep into it,"" the consultancy said in a report on heritage gold in January.

lifestyle,Chanel buys up more jasmine fields to safeguard famous No. 5," PEGOMAS, France, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Wary of disappearing flower crops used in its best-selling perfumes, fashion and beauty firm Chanel has bought up more land in southern France to secure its supplies of jasmine and other varieties, harvested by hand in a delicate annual ritual. The luxury group said it had bought up an extra 10 hectares (100,000 square metres) of land, adding to the 20 hectares it already exploits in partnership with a local family near the town of Grasse, known for its surrounding flower fields. On a sunny late August morning before the heat reached a peak in nearby Pegomas, dozens of workers were busy with this year's jasmine harvest, the key ingredient for Chanel's 100-year-old No.5 perfume, created by late designer Coco Chanel. Chanel  struck a deal with the Mul family in the late 1980s to anchor its production of five flowers in the region. Some local producers began selling their land at the time, drawn in part by property deals in the region close to Nice and the French Riviera. ""There was a time when there was a threat because jasmine production was starting to move to other countries,"" said Olivier Polge, who followed in his father's footsteps to become Chanel's head perfumer in 2013. The jasmine grown in Grasse has a specific scent. The region became a flower and fragrance hub in the 17th century, when local leather tanners began to perfume their wares. Fabrice Bianchi, who runs the Mul family's production, said operations were not overly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with pickers able to work outside. The virus causes some sufferers to lose their sense of taste and smell - a particular problem for perfumers, known as ""noses"" in the business. ""For sure, it was a pretty peculiar year,"" Polge told Reuters. ""But in many ways it was the same for me as for everyone, even though I'm a nose - we all tried not to get it.""

lifestyle,British music festivals ready to rock despite high COVID-19 cases," LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of revellers will descend on late summer music festivals across Britain this weekend, armed with a negative COVID test or proof of vaccination in an effort to curb rising infections. Reading and Leeds, twin events that are a rite of passage for post-exam teenagers, will be two of the biggest since the government removed restrictions in July following a rapid vaccine rollout. Reading had a capacity of 105,000 in 2019. With Monday a public holiday in England, other large gatherings are being staged across the country, including the 70,000-strong Creamfields event in northwest England. The traditional Notting Hill Carnival in London has however been cancelled again. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said this month that a successful hosting of the British Grand Prix and Wimbledon tennis tournament last month showed mass events could be held safely, but that caution was needed in crowded settings. However, many health experts remain concerned that people will lose their inhibitions in the excitement, causing a spike in cases. Soccer matches in the Euro 2020 tournament and a surfing festival in Cornwall have already led to significant outbreaks in one of the countries hardest hit by the virus. Cornwall Council has said 4,700 cases could be linked to the Boardmasters festival, which attracted about 50,000 people to the small seaside town of Newquay this month. Meradin Peachey, director of public health for the area that covers Reading to the west of London, said a spike was a concern given that older teenagers were offered vaccines only this month. ""Sixteen, seventeen year olds are the main groups that are going to be there and they're not covered yet,"" she told BBC News. ""We are trying to ask people to show proof of a lateral flow test before you even get anywhere near the gates."" British infections have started to rise again, with about 34,000 cases and around 100 deaths being reported per day in the last week. But admissions to hospital remain well below previous peaks of the pandemic. 'UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL' Scientists believe the trigger points for spreading the virus are public transport and shared cars to get to events as outdoor gatherings themselves, even with large numbers, can be relatively risk free. Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said mixing at festivals was a risk when the rate of infection was about 25 times higher than a year ago thanks to the Delta variant. ""I think there's a greater capacity for people to be more intimate with one another, up close and personal, than in regimented seating you'll see somewhere like the Grand Prix,"" he said, referring to the Formula One race. With the music industry desperate to start touring again, festival organisers say the need for a negative test or vaccine  will prevent cases from surging. Pop-up vaccination clinics will be on site at the Reading and Leeds festivals headlined by UK rapper Stormzy, but no one under the influence of drink or drugs will be inoculated, health organisers said.

lifestyle,Tom Cruise shows off latest daredevil 'Mission: Impossible' stunt," LOS ANGELES, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Tom Cruise on Thursday presented what he called his most dangerous stunt ever in a clip from his upcoming ""Mission: Impossible 7"" movie. Cruise, known for doing his own stunts, takes a motor-bike ride down a ramp and off a giant cliff in Norway and lets go in mid-air before his parachute is released. The clip, and a featurette of Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie talking about the feat, were shown at the CinemaCon gathering of movie theater operators and Hollywood studio executives in Las Vegas, entertainment media reported. ""This is far and away the most dangerous thing I?�ve attempted; we?�ve been working on this for years,"" Cruise said in the video, according to Deadline Hollywood. ?�I wanted to do it since a little kid."" ""Mission: Impossible 7,"" in which Cruise returns as suave spy Ethan Hunt, is due for release in May 2022 after a coronavirus-disrupted shoot in Italy, Norway and the U.K. of more than a year. Cruise, 59, said he trained for more than a year to perfect the stunt, including making 500 sky-diving sessions and 13,000 motor-bike jumps, the Hollywood Reporter said. The stunt was filmed six times. In past movies, Cruise has hung off the side of a plane as it takes off, piloted a helicopter through narrow mountain ravines, scaled the 2,717-foot high (828 meters) Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, and performed a sky dive from almost five miles high.

sports,Zverev sees off Murray to reach Indian Wells fourth round," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells. Former world number one Murray, who got the better of the German in their two previous meetings, jumped out to a 3-0 lead and seemed to unnerve the 24-year-old by standing well inside the court when returning his second serves. But Zverev, seeded third, regrouped to win six of the next seven games and took the first set when Murray's drop shot failed to get over the net. Just as in the first set, Murray got an early break in the second but Zverev again battled back despite needing a lengthy break to lace up a pair of shoes after the shoelace on his first pair snapped. Zverev had the match on his racket serving at 6-5 but missed an overhead, a shot that bedevilled him all day, sending the set to a tiebreak. Murray's uneven play continued in the tiebreak and after a furious rally of volleys at the net he sent the final one wide on match point, the Scot slamming his racket into the court in frustration. Zverev told reporters after the match that he felt great. ""I'm happy about how everything went,"" he added. ""I thought it was a very entertaining match. It was pretty high level, so I'm happy to be through."" Zverev has now recorded wins against three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal, who were known as the 'Big Four' of men's tennis until injury problems took their toll on Murray. ""This is physically the best I've felt in a while, but I'm sort of battling my game a little bit,"" Murray said.

sports,"Gruden unlikely to coach in NFL again, say experts"," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Jon Gruden is unlikely to get another chance to coach an NFL team following the disclosure that he sent sexist, racist and homophobic emails, sports marketing experts said. Gruden resigned as coach of the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday after the New York Times reported he used misogynistic and anti-gay language in numerous emails during a seven-year period dating back to 2010. According to the Times, he used a racial trope to describe NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith, mocked the drafting of a gay player in 2014, the hiring of women referees and tolerance for player protests aimed at promoting racial justice. ""Given the NFL's increased focus on combating racism, sexism and social injustice, I can't see Gruden ever returning to a coaching position in the league,"" said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing analyst at Pinnacle Advertising. ""But assuming nothing worse in his past is uncovered, and he shows contrition, apologizes profusely, and does the necessary penance, in time he may be able to work his way back into the broadcasting booth, possibly with a network like Fox."" Others were not so sure. ""No chance for NFL or NFL TV employment,"" said George Belch, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. ""Maybe you can explain and excuse one transgression but not multiple gaffs, which speak of his character."" Gruden, 58, resigned five games into the fourth season of a 10-year, $100 million contract, saying he did not want to be a distraction and adding that he never meant to hurt anyone. Gruden returned to coaching in 2018 after a nine-year stint as an ESPN Monday Night Football analyst when he signed a deal to re-join the Raiders, who he initially coached from 1998-2001 before going to Tampa Bay, where he won a Super Bowl in 2002. ""I would say he is definitely done in the short term in both coaching and broadcast,"" said Victor Matheson, a professor at College of the Holy Cross and an expert on sports economics. ""And it is not like Gruden had made himself indispensable over the past 20 years,"" he said, noting that since winning the Super Bowl, he never won another playoff game. ""It's one thing to overlook poor behavior when a person is a star. It is quite another when a person has been decidedly below average for two decades. ""There must be a pretty long list of coaches out there who can consistently not win playoff games and lose a few more games than they win who don't carry the same racist and homophobic baggage that Gruden now does.""

Victoria sports minister Martin Pakula said on Tuesday that players planning to compete at the first Grand Slam of the year should get vaccinated to give themselves the best chance of competing in Melbourne. Tennis Australia has declined to comment on arrangements for players based on their vaccination status. However, vaccinated players are expected to given more freedom to move around and may also be able to skip the country's mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival.

The mastermind, college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, paid $100,000 to three accounts, including $40,000 to the Winston-Salem, North Carolina school's volleyball program and $50,000 to a private volleyball camp Ferguson controlled.

sports,IOC's Coates rules out pressuring China over human rights," MELBOURNE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will not pressure 2022 Winter Olympics hosts China over its human rights record because it is not in the governing body's remit to dictate to sovereign countries, IOC Vice-President John Coates said on Wednesday. Rights groups and U.S. lawmakers have called on the IOC to postpone next year's Beijing Games and relocate the event unless China ends what the United States deems ongoing genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups. Chinese authorities have been accused of facilitating forced labour by detaining around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in camps since 2016. China denies wrongdoing, saying it has set up vocational training centres to combat extremism. Coates said the IOC's human rights remit only covered the ""Olympic movement"" and the National Olympic Committees within it. ""The IOC does place a very high emphasis on human rights,"" Coates told reporters at a media conference. ""I know it's a very important part of the fundamental principles of Olympism, the fundamental principles set out in the Olympic charter. ""But the IOC is not -- the IOC's remit is to ensure that there is no human rights abuses in respect of the conduct of the Games within the National Olympic Committees or within the Olympic movement. ""We have no ability to go into a country and tell them what to do. All we can do is to award the Olympics to a country, under conditions set out in a host contract ... and then ensure they are followed."" Coates was asked why the IOC would intervene in Afghanistan, where the Games are not being held, but not take a stand in countries where they are. The IOC said last month it had helped around 100 members of the ""Olympic community"" in Afghanistan to leave the country on humanitarian visas after the Taliban took control. ""The work the IOC is doing is to protect the Olympians and those involved in the Olympic moments, those who comprise the sports federation in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""That's within our remit.

sports,Giants chase NLDS clincher at Dodger Stadium," 2021-10-12 14:04:00 GMT+00:00 - The San Francisco Giants are looking right at home in Los Angeles and will have one more game in Southern California in their attempt to reach their first National League Championship Series since 2014. On a Monday night when the weather was more representative of the Bay Area, the Giants turned in a 1-0 victory in Game 3 of the NL Division Series. San Francisco will play at Dodger Stadium again Tuesday with a chance to wrap up the best-of-five series. If there was a team that figured to be able to take advantage of the elements it was the Giants, who caught a break with a strong crosswind from left to right Monday. After a regular season in which San Francisco won a major-league-best 107 games, the Giants continue to find ways to produce victories. Game 3 ended when Dodgers pinch hitter Gavin Lux flied out to the warning track on a ball that was registered at 106.9 mph off the bat. ""The wind, from the beginning of the game, was something we have never seen here at all,"" Giants third baseman Evan Longoria said on MLB Network. ""Even that ball that Lux hit probably on a normal night goes out. But it was our night tonight."" Longoria managed to solve the riddle of the wind with a fifth-inning homer to left field against Dodgers right-hander Max Scherzer. Los Angeles had been 12-0 in Scherzer starts before Monday, but four San Francisco pitchers bested the Dodgers' ace. ""I needed everything I had behind the ball that I hit out,"" Longoria said. ""Thankfully it was the difference."" After Giants left-hander Alex Wood opened Monday's game with 4 1/3 scoreless innings and closer Camilo Doval finished it off with a six-out save, San Francisco will send right-hander Anthony DeSclafani to the mound Tuesday. DeSclafani went 13-7 with a 3.17 ERA in 31 regular-season starts, but he was 0-3 with a 7.33 ERA in six starts against the Dodgers. However, he tossed six scoreless innings in his most recent outing against Los Angeles, on Sept. 3, and he is entering a series in which his team has blanked the opponent twice. The Dodgers had right-hander Tony Gonsolin (4-1, 3.23 ERA) listed as their Game 4 starter, but manager Dave Roberts said all options would be considered for the win-or-go-home contest. Los Angeles could return to Game 1 starter Walker Buehler, who gave up three runs on six hits over 6 1/3 innings during the series opener, but he would be pitching on just three days' rest. Facing a must-win game in the playoffs is not a foreign concept for the Dodgers, who rallied from a 3-1 series deficit to win last year's NLCS against the Atlanta Braves. The Dodgers will need something closer to their nine-run, 11-hit performance in Game 2 on Saturday in order to force a decisive Game 5 at San Francisco on Thursday. In six regular-season starts against the Giants this year, Buehler was 3-1 with a 2.19 ERA. Gonsolin had just one start against the Giants this season and gave up three runs over 3 1/3 innings. In three career outings against San Francisco (two starts), Gonsolin is 0-2 with a 4.32 ERA. ""Just win (Tuesday),"" Roberts said when asked about his message to the team. ""Everything is on the table and our focus has to turn to (Game 4). Whatever it takes to win, and we'll kind of pick up the pieces after that."" --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,"Ice hockey federation seeks reform after racist incident, president says"," MOSCOW, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) will assess the need for harsher sanctions in response to a racist incident in Ukraine and plans to pressure leagues around the world to amend their rule books to define sanctions for racist behaviour, the new IIHF president said. Luc Tardif took office as head of the IIHF a day before the hockey world was rattled by footage of Andriy Deniskin, a forward at HC Kremenchuk in the Ukrainian Hockey League (UHL), taunting HC Donbass defenceman Jalen Smereck, who is Black, by pretending to peel and eat a banana. Smereck, 24, took a leave of absence after the incident. HC Donbass announced on Sunday it had reached a mutual agreement to terminate the American's contract. Tardif, who has dual French-Canadian citizenship, has ordered the IIHF's ethics committee to investigate the incident and assess the 13-game suspension handed to Deniskin by the Ukrainian Ice Hockey Federation, the maximum that could be imposed under its rules. ""Thirteen games, that's a third of the season,"" Tardif told Reuters in a video conference interview. ""That's still a lot, but we don't think it's enough."" If the ethics committee determines that the sanctions against Deniskin are inadequate, it could bring the case to the IIHF's disciplinary board for further action. ""That's where we can add to the sanctions, but only in terms of the competitions under our jurisdiction,"" Tardif said, referring to international games. Tardif added he could not be certain that additional sanctions would be imposed, an option left to the disciplinary board's discretion. ""By calling on the ethics committee, this shows that I think we could go further in respect to the sanctions,"" he said. ""I will let the committees come to a decision, but I don't want to stop there."" TOOLS TO SANCTION Ukrainian hockey officials have been criticised for what many players, including Toronto Maple Leafs forward Wayne Simmonds, one of the most prominent Black players in the National Hockey League (NHL), consider too lenient a sanction. Tardif said IIHF officials had analysed the rule books of several national leagues and federations in the wake of the incident. The IIHF realised that many of them did not define clear sanctions for the perpetrators of racist, homophobic and other kinds of discriminatory behaviour. ""We have to put pressure on the federations and the leagues to include sanctions for these types of incidents in their rules,"" Tardif said. ""We will have to spend the year encouraging federations to introduce a scale of sanctions. If not, they won't have any tools to hand them out.""

sports,Ricciardo gives a thumbs-up as F1 learns from Grosjean crash," Oct 12 (Reuters) - McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo has given a thumbs-up to new flame-resistant gloves, developed by Formula One's governing body after Romain Grosjean's fiery crash in Bahrain last year, following trials at the Turkish Grand Prix weekend. Grosjean made a miraculous escape from a fireball crash in  November but suffered burns to the back of his hands as he clambered free of the wreckage. The Frenchman's Haas car speared through the protective barriers lining the track in a 53G impact that split it in half and burst into flames. The governing FIA has been working on improving protection from fire and last week announced that selected drivers would be testing new gloves for comfort and dexterity during Turkish Grand Prix practice. ""I used them...I didn't notice the difference,"" said Australian Ricciardo, one of five authorised to try them out. ""I'm also not very fussy with kit...but completely fine for me. It's a nice addition without any downside."" Race director Michael Masi said the test went well. ""Due to..Romain's incident it was an area we started working on immediately, and I think we identified very quickly that it was an area we could improve,"" he told reporters. ""The initial feedback from the drivers is 'Yup, all good'. There is a couple of fine-tuning elements with a couple of the brands but nothing insurmountable."" Masi said the flame-proof properties had already been proven and it was now just a question of driver comfort.

sports,Jordan backs league's COVID-19 vaccination stance," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Chicago Bulls great Michael Jordan said he is a ""firm believer in science"" and that he backed the National Basketball Association's (NBA) stance on COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the new season starting on Oct. 19 The NBA has said unvaccinated players must comply with a long list of restrictions to play in games and take part in team activities such as practice. U.S. media reported earlier this month that 95% of players have had at least one shot but some players, including Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving, have not said publicly if they have been vaccinated. Jordan, who played 13 seasons with the Bulls winning six championships and currently owns the Charlotte Hornets, said he was not concerned by the league's protocols. ""Not at all. I'm total in unison with the league,"" Jordan said on NBC's Today show. ""I'm a firm believer in science and I'm going to stick with that and hopefully everybody abides by whatever the league sets the rules. ""I think once everybody buys in, we're going to be fine.""

sports,Hungary fans fight with police inside Wembley," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Dozens of Hungary fans fought with baton-wielding police inside Wembley Stadium at the start of their country's World Cup qualifying game against England on Tuesday in scenes reminiscent of the worst days of football hooliganism. Around 600 Hungary fans were squeezed into a small corner of the stadium, many dressed in the black t-shirts of the ultras who follow the country. The Metropolitan Police said they had taken action after  racial abuse of a steward. ""Shortly after the start of tonight's match at Wembley, officers entered the stand to arrest a spectator for a racially aggravated public order offence following comments made towards a steward,"" the police said on Twitter. ""As the officers made the arrest, minor disorder broke out involving other spectators. Order was quickly restored and there have been no further incidents at this stage."" Hungary fans had booed as the England players took the knee before kickoff, the visitors staying on their feet and pointing to the respect badge on their shirts. As the match started, trouble erupted between the fans and a group of stewards. A line of police then arrived and some were raining baton blows on fans, many of whom climbed over a barrier and were punching and kicking the security personnel. One fan fell to the ground with blood gushing from a head wound, while several police officers were also knocked down as the fans attacked them. The police then moved back out of sight down a tunnel and fans returned to their seats, with a group of helmeted riot police arriving in force. The incident comes after there was extensive trouble at Wembley in the Euro 2020 final, when hundreds of fans charged barriers to gain entry. It also follows Hungary being fined and banned from having fans in their ground as punishment for racist abuse and missile-throwing in Budapest when the teams met in September.

sports,"F1 benefiting from cost cap and rule changes, says Brawn"," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Formula One fans are seeing the benefits of this year's cost cap and the new rules coming for 2022, the sport's managing director Ross Brawn said on Tuesday with the championship battle on a knife-edge. Mercedes' seven times champion Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen have traded the lead repeatedly since March with the latter only six points clear after 16 of the scheduled 22 rounds. Four teams and six drivers have won races so far, although Verstappen has won seven and Hamilton five. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the cost cap and the rules changes that were implemented are having a positive impact on the closeness and intensity of the championship,"" said Brawn in a column for the ""There is no capacity for a team to pour massive resource into a championship and try and run away with it. The resources are now limited and the teams are also focused on next year?�s car, which is requiring a lot of time and resource. ""We still want a meritocracy. We still want the best team to win. But we don?�t want them to win by a country mile simply because they?�ve got a bigger budget than anyone else. It?�s pleasing to see the way things are developing."" Mercedes, winners of the past seven drivers' and constructors' championships, said in June that development on this year's car had stopped with the team focusing on major changes for next season. The champions were 40 points behind Red Bull after eight races but are now 36 in front. The $145 million budget cap introduced this season is set to drop to $135 million in 2023. Red Bull boss Christian Horner told reporters after Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix that the variety of winners had been a great feature of the season -- with Alpine's Esteban Ocon and McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo among them. ""It seems a shame to change it for next year, really,"" he added. Brawn disagreed, saying there remained underlying problems to resolve with cars still struggling to follow each other closely. ""This weekend I heard some comments around whether the 2022 regulation changes are needed given we're currently enjoying such a golden season,"" he said. ""While the 2022 rules won?�t change the situation overnight I think they are a much better platform to improve the racing on the track.""

The Group I match was interrupted soon after Poland forward Karol Swiderski scored inside the box following an assist from midfielder Mateusz Klich in the 77th minute. Albania were missing several key players, with striker Sokol Cikalleshi being the last one to withdraw from the squad with COVID-19, but they still managed to dominate the first half. After an intense battle, and several missed chances by both sides, Poland got on top in the second period and scored through Swiderski, whose goal sparked the crowd trouble and suspension.

sports,NFL community on Gruden's resignation as Raiders coach: 'had to go'," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Individuals from the NFL community and beyond condemned former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden, who resigned after reports emerged that he had sent emails which included racist, homophobic and misogynistic terms. Gruden, who resigned on Monday five games into the fourth season of a 10-year, $100 million contract, came under fire in recent days following reports in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times that cited emails dating back to 2010. ""You can't be racist, homophobic and misogynistic. You shouldn't be any of them,"" free-agent quarterback Robert Griffin III wrote on Twitter. According to the reports, Gruden used a racial trope to describe NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith, mocked the drafting of a gay player in 2014, the hiring of women referees and tolerance for player protests aimed at promoting racial justice. ""Jon Gruden had to go, immediately. And not one person should blame 'cancel culture', this is called accountability. Period."" tweeted Nigerian-American former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho. In a statement late on Monday announcing his resignation, the 58-year-old Gruden said he did not want to be a distraction and never meant to hurt anyone. Gruden returned to coaching in 2018 after a nine-year stint as an ESPN Monday Night Football analyst when he signed a deal to re-join the Raiders. He initially coached the Raiders from 1998-2001 and then was traded to Tampa Bay where he guided the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl championship in his first season while with the team from 2002-2008. According to a Wall Street Journal report last Friday, Gruden wrote in a 2011 email to then-Washington president Bruce Allen during the NFL lockout that the NFLPA head Smith, who is Black, has ""lips the size of michellin tires."" Gruden told ESPN that he did not recall writing the email but said he routinely used the term ""rubber lips"" to ""refer to a guy I catch as lying ... he can't spit it out."" ""The email from Jon Gruden -- and some of the reaction to it -- confirms that the fight against racism, racist tropes and intolerance is not over,"" Smith said in a statement late Monday. ""This is not about an email as much as it is about a pervasive belief by some that people who look like me can be treated as less."" Gruden apologised on Sunday for the remarks and said he was not racist and ""don't have an ounce of racism in me"". Gruden ultimately announced his resignation after the New York Times reported on Monday that he used misogynistic and anti-gay language in numerous emails during a seven-year period. ""This kind of behavior is unacceptable and reprehensible. Las Vegas is a welcoming city and the Raiders are a part of our family,"" Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak wrote.

sports,"Senegal, Morocco secure top spots in World Cup qualifying groups"," CAPE TOWN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Senegal's Famara Diedhiou scored a hat-trick on Tuesday to propel his country into the final phase of African World Cup qualifying followed later in the day by Morocco who also guaranteed top spot in their group with two games to play. Diedhiou, who left English second-tier club Bristol City for Turkey at the start of the season, headed Senegal ahead after 22 minutes against Namibia in Johannesburg and added two more goals in the second half for a 3-1 victory. The win gave Senegal an unassailable lead in Group H, with a 100% record after four games and two to play in November. The match was played in South Africa due to refurbishment work at Namibia's home stadium. Morocco then beat Guinea 4-1 in Rabat to ensure they finish top of Group I and will be one of the 10 group winners competing in the playoffs in March for five African places at the World Cup finals in Qatar. Selim Amallah scored twice for Morocco after Ayoub El Kaabi gave them an early lead as they also kept up a 100% record. Sofiane Boufal scored the fourth for the north African side in the last minute. An 11th minute own goal handed South Africa a narrow 1-0 home win over Ethiopia in Group G, where they have a one-point lead over Ghana, who earlier won away in Zimbabwe. Ethiopia captain Getaneh Kebede miscued an attempted clearance at a corner and sliced the ball into his own net at Soccer City in Johannesburg, where 2,000 spectators were allowed to watch the game. They were the first fans at any South African sporting event since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. South Africa are now on 10 points with Ghana one behind after Thomas Partey hammered home a thunderous free kick to secure a 1-0 victory against Zimbabwe in Harare. South Africa travel to Ghana for their last qualifier next month. Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring as Algeria reclaimed top place in Group A by beating Niger 4-0 away in Niamey. The African champions lead Burkina Faso on goal difference, with the two countries set for a showdown next month. Mahrez's 20th minute strike was followed by goals from Aissa Mandi, Ismael Bennacer and Baghdad Bounedjah.

sports,Late own goal ends Australia's record run and hands Japan much-needed win," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Australia's record-breaking run in World Cup qualifying ended on Tuesday when Aziz Behich's late own goal handed Japan a lifeline as the Samurai Blue earned a 2-1 victory at Saitama Stadium. Behich bundled the ball over his own goal line after Takuma Asano's late shot looped up and hit the post, ensuring Australia missed out on a 12th straight win on the road to Qatar 2022. Ao Tanaka had given Japan the lead in the ninth minute as the home side sought to pick up only their second victory after four games in the final phase of the continent's qualifying campaign, a run that put coach Hajime Moriyasu under pressure. The result moves third-placed Japan to within three points of the Socceroos, who lead Group B ahead of Saudi Arabia - also on nine points but with a game in hand - in the battle for two guaranteed places from the section at next year's World Cup. Tanaka was called up in place of Gaku Shibasaki and the midfielder impressed, striking across goalkeeper Mat Ryan to give the Japanese the lead. But Ajdin Hrustic levelled the scores 20 minute from time with a curling free kick that went in off the underside of Shuichi Gonda's crossbar after VAR had overturned a decision to award the Australians a penalty. The Japanese, who have qualified for every World Cup since 1998, were under huge pressure going into the game having won only one of their previous matches in the final phase of Asia's preliminaries. Moriyasu rung the changes, dropping Shibasaki - who was responsible for the goal Japan conceded against Saudi Arabia last week - and replacing him with the more dynamic Tanaka. The change paid off in the ninth minute as Tanaka was found with time and space in the penalty area by Takumi Minamino, and the midfielder scored with a low shot past Ryan. Japan had the opportunities to add to their tally with Junya Ito and Yuya Osako both missing the target, and they were to rue not taking those chances in the second half. Aaron Mooy and Tom Rogic went close before Hrustic was brought down on the edge of the area by Hidemasa Morita and, after referee Abdulrahman Al Jassim had initially awarded a penalty, VAR overturned the decision and gave a free kick. It mattered little as Hrustic struck in style before Ryan kept a determined Japan at bay until Behich's own goal. Only the top two teams in each of Asia's two qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals, with the third-placed teams going into a series of playoffs.

sports,Denmark defy odds to finish 2021 on a high," COPENHAGEN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - With their qualification for the World Cup finals, Denmark showed they have continued to rise in the wake of Christian Eriksen's heart attack and the near-tragedy has not derailed their impressive development under coach Kasper Hjulmand. Denmark booked their spot at next year's tournament in Qatar with a 1-0 victory over Austria on Tuesday that left them seven points clear of second-placed Scotland at the summit of Group F and their progress is all the more remarkable given what happened in June. When playmaker Eriksen collapsed to the turf at the Parken Stadium in their Euro 2020 opener against Finland, it was clear to everyone in the stadium and the watching millions that the player's life was in danger. Thankfully, rapid intervention by team mates and medical staff ensured Eriksen survived, but for most observers the idea that the team could possibly thrive in his absence seemed absurd. How wrong they were. Hjulmand gathered his shaken squad and somehow, they picked themselves up to make the knockout phase of Euro 2020 by the skin of their teeth. They then ripped up the script and tore their way through to the semi-finals, where they narrowly lost to England before receiving a hero's welcome on their return to Copenhagen. The wave of emotion did not stop there, and they continued to ride it through an incredible World Cup qualifying campaign, full of scintillating attacking football backed by an unbreachable defence. In Eriksen's absence the world has learned the names of Mikkel Damsgaard, the mercurial playmaker who replaced him, and winger Andreas Skov Olsen as Hjulmand's faith in his young creative talents allowed them to flourish. But the cornerstone has been the rock at the centre of the Danish defence - captain Simon Kjaer. His handling of the incident that almost claimed the life of his close friend Eriksen won praise from around the world, and his performances for club and country earned him a spot on the shortlist for the 2021 Ballon d'Or award. Kjaer's booming penalty in their win over Moldova on Saturday - only his fifth goal in 116 appearances for the national side - appeared to draw a line under a turbulent and emotional time for both himself and his team as they closed in on qualification for Qatar. Having come through an extraordinary trial by fire, Denmark will finish 2021 as one of the teams of the year and begin looking forward to 2022, when they will again measure themselves against the best of the world.

sports,Ronaldo nets hat-trick as Portugal rout Luxembourg," FARO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - A 58th career hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo helped Portugal stroll to a 5-0 home win over Luxembourg in Group A of World Cup qualifying on Tuesday. The treble, which meant Ronaldo became the first man to net 10 international hat-tricks, takes his tally to 115 international goals from 182 caps as he continues to pull away as the top men's international goalscorer of all-time. Victory ensures Portugal remain a point behind leaders Serbia, who moved onto 17 points with a 3-1 home win over Azerbaijan, with a game in hand and superior goal difference. Portugal had the game all but won within the first 18 minutes. Ronaldo struck twice from the penalty spot before his Manchester United team mate Bruno Fernandes made it three as he fired in following good work from Bernardo Silva. The forward then missed two gilt-edged chances either side of the break as he sought a third, before being denied a spectacular hat-trick goal when Anthony Moris kept out his acrobatic overhead kick. Portugal did not have to wait long for their fourth, however, as midfielder Joao Palhinha headed in from the resulting corner with just over 20 minutes to go. Ronaldo was not to be denied as the hosts pushed on, netting three minutes from time with a header from close range. Next month Fernando Santos's Portugal side travel to Ireland before then hosting Serbia in what could be a winner-takes-all fixture to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Things did not start well for Swedes, who had the assistant referee and the woodwork to thank in the first half as an early goal by Giorgos Masouras was ruled out for offside and he also hit a post while Vangelis Pavlidis headed off the crossbar just before the break. Isak was felled in the box by Konstantinos Mavropanos and Forsberg rattled the resulting spot kick low to the left for his second penalty in two games. Isak added the second in the 69th minute, exploiting a hesitant Greek defence to latch onto a long ball by keeper Robin Olsen before rounding the keeper and calmly chipping the ball home. Greece found themselves down to 10 men in the 86th minute when Pantelis Hatzidiakos was shown a second yellow card, snuffing out any chance they might have had of making a late comeback.

sports,England held 1-1 by Hungary in match marred by crowd violence," LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - England took another, somewhat faltering, step towards 2022 World Cup qualification when they drew 1-1 with Hungary at Wembley on Tuesday and are now three points clear at the top of Group I with two matches remaining. The gamewas marred by fighting in the stands between Hungary fans and baton-wielding police just after kickoff, with riot police entering the fray as visiting supporters forced stewards and police back down a tunnel. On the pitch, the visitors went ahead with a Roland Sallai penalty in the 24th minute after England's Luke Shaw caught a stooping Loci Nego in the head as he attempted a clearance. England equalised after 37 minutes when a Phil Foden free kick was flicked on by Tyrone Mings and the ball was turned in by John Stones from close range. The centre back came close to a second when he headed a corner just wide after an hour while Harry Kane miskicked when well placed in front of goal - the captain's last contribution before being replaced by Tammy Abraham for the last 15 minutes. That, and other changes, failed to swing the game England's way as Gareth Southgate's experiment of playing Foden, Jack Grealish and Mason Mount together in a miniature midfield proved something of a failure. Hungary were certainly more energetic and looked more motivated than when they were swept aside 4-0 by England in Budapest last month and Southgate was quick to praise them, while accepting his own side's shortcomings. TACTICAL PROBLEM ""Hungary, full credit to them. I thought they caused us a tactical problem. We weren?�t fluid and I didn?�t think we played at the level that we need to play,"" he said. ""We?�ll go away and think about the balance of the team a little bit but I think individually we can do better as well. We made lots of simple mistakes with the ball. Collectively we did not play at the level we need to. ""I think right across the board from the start we weren?�t sharp with our play, gave the ball away. It?�s the first time for a long time but we have to hold our hands up to that."" The result leaves England top of the group on 20 points ahead of Poland, who beat Albania (15 points) 1-0 away in another match hit by crowd trouble. Euro 2020 runners-up England are still strong favourites to win the group via their remaining games against Albania and San Marino next month, but have left themselves with work to do. Hungary, in fourth place on 11 points, need a miracle to have a chance of snatching second place and a playoff berth. Their entire squad and staff formed a centre circle huddle at the end of the game, then stood in front of their supporters - showing their better side after the unpleasant scenes two hours earlier - in a joint rendition of their national anthem, celebrating together as if they had won the World Cup. England?�s players and most of the near-70,000 home fans had already gone by then but though few will long remember the match, it might prove more useful in Southgate's World Cup preparations than if it had been a routine victory.

sports,Denmark reach World Cup with 1-0 win over Austria," COPENHAGEN, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Denmark became the second European nation to reach the 2022 World Cup after a 1-0 home win over Austria on Tuesday left them top of qualifying Group F with an unassailable seven-point lead over second-placed Scotland. After Germany advanced to the 32-nation tournament in Qatar on Monday, the Danes secured their own berth with two games to spare as a 53rd-minute goal from Joakim Maehle helped them to an eighth successive qualifying victory. Denmark and Germany joined Qatar, who gained an automatic spot in the finals as the host nation. Only the group winners from European qualifying advance directly while the runners-up enter the playoffs. Denmark have scored 27 goals and conceded none so far in World Cup qualifying, with their run to the finals underpinned by some impressive free-flowing football. Following joyous scenes as the Danes mobbed each other after the final whistle, captain Simon Kjaer stressed they now wanted to make an impact in Qatar after romping through qualifying. ""We built up a crew and a mentality that is incredibly healthy and we have been eager to improve all the time,"" the 32-year old centre back told the country's Kanal 5 television. ""We share the best with each other and adding that to the quality we have, we can go a long way. We have come a long way already but we have only become hungrier."" For all their flair and attacking potential, the Danes did look jittery for long spells against a well-organised Austria side who packed their midfield to cut off the supply routes. Visiting goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann denied Andreas Skov Olsen and Mikkel Damsgaard in the first half and then kept out a Thomas Delaney effort in the 48th minute as the home side struggled to create clear-cut chances. But Bachmann was powerless five minutes later as Denmark's best moment of the match produced a brilliant goal with Delaney at the heart of a breathtaking move. The central midfielder weaved his way past four markers through the middle and then teed up Maehle to plant his shot from eight metres inside the near post and delight the home fans in a packed Parken stadium. Delaney was elated after the match as Denmark made it to their second successive World Cup, having reached the round of 16 in the 2018 tournament before advancing to the Euro 2020 semi-finals this year. ""It's a pleasure throughout, in every match,"" he said. ""The support we've had. It is unique, what we have created, we can be proud of."" Maehle added: ""It means a lot, it's one of the coolest nights in the Park in a long time. It is fantastic. It's strong for us to win here, and we got this ticket to the World Cup.""

sports,"Top seed Pliskova, defending champion Andreescu lose at Indian Wells"," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Big servers Karolina Pliskova, Bianca Andreescu and Reilly Opelka saw their most potent weapon neutralized by strong desert winds on Monday as they all crashed out of Indian Wells. The biggest upset of the day came when tournament lucky loser Beatriz Haddad Maia, ranked 115 in the world, defeated top seed Pliskova 6-3 7-5 in a match where service holds were rare as wind gusts reached 40 miles per hour. Pliskova, who reached the Wimbledon final in July, served 12 double faults and her service was broken eight times by the Brazilian in their third-round meeting. Haddad Maia will next face Anett Kontaveit after the Estonian beat defending champion Bianca Andreescu 7-6(5) 6-3 to extend her winning streak to eight matches. Kontaveit, who already has two hard court titles to her name this season, won the last five games of the match to see off the tournament's 2019 champion, who won the U.S. Open crown the same year. Opelka's thunderous serve lacked its usual potency as the towering American lost 6-3 6-4 to Grigor Dimitrov. The win avenged Dimitrov's defeat to Opelka in straight sets at the Canadian Open in August. Dimitrov will next face top-seeded Daniil Medvedev, who defeated 27th seed Filip Krajinovic 6-2 7-6(1). Medvedev's fellow Russian, Andrey Rublev, lost 6-4 3-6 7-5 to American Tommy Paul. In other third-round action, Diego Schwartzman sent Briton Dan Evans packing 5-7 6-4 6-0 and 10th seed Angelique Kerber held on to defeat Daria Kasatkina 6-2 1-6 6-4 Evans, who reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open last month, fought back from 5-2 down to win the first set and maintained the momentum to break the Argentine 11th seed's serve in the opening game of the second set. But Schwartzman roared back to convert four of six break points in the second set to level the match.

sports,"Raiders's Gruden resigns after anti-gay, sexist comments in emails"," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Jon Gruden said on Monday he has resigned as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after the New York Times reported he had used racist, misogynistic and homophobic language in emails over several years. The emails mocked the drafting of a gay player in 2014, the hiring of women referees, tolerance for player protests aimed at promoting racial justice and the league's emphasis on reducing concussions, the Times reported earlier on Monday. A league source confirmed the accuracy of the report to Reuters. ""I have resigned as Head Coach of the Las Vegas Raiders,"" Gruden said in a statement. ""I love the Raiders and do not want to be a distraction. Thank you to all the players, coaches, staff, and fans of Raider Nation. I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone."" Raiders owner Mark Davis said in a statement he had accepted Gruden's resignation without elaborating. The team said Rich Bisaccia would serve as interim head coach, effective immediately. The emails came to the NFL's attention during a review of workplace misconduct at the Washington Football Team that was completed this summer. Gruden's emails were sent to Bruce Allen, the former president of the Washington Football Team, and others while Gruden was working as an analyst for ESPN, according to the Times. Gruden also referred to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell using a homophobic slur, it added. On Friday the NFL called an email by the Super Bowl winning coach in 2011 that included a racist slur directed at NFL Players Association (NFLPA) chief DeMaurice Smith, who is Black, ""abhorrent"". Gruden, who is white, said he regretted the email but said he did not have ""a blade of racism"" in him.

sports,Iran's Jahanbakhsh heads home to cancel out Son strike," Oct 12 (Reuters) - Alireza Jahanbakhsh's late header cancelled out Son Heung-min's opener as Iran drew 1-1 with South Korea in Tehran on Tuesday to remain on top of Group A in the final round of Asia's preliminaries for next year's World Cup. The Feyenoord forward powered his effort past Kim Seung-gyu 14 minutes from time after Son had put the Koreans in front three minutes into the second half. Dragan Skocic's side move onto 10 points from their first four games in Group A and remain two points ahead of the Koreans as the pair consolidated their hold on the top two positions in the standings. Only the first two teams in each of the two groups in the continent's qualifying competition are guaranteed to progress to the finals while the third place finishers will advance to a series of playoffs. Third-placed United Arab Emirates will take on Iraq later on Tuesday while Syria meet Lebanon. Iran had won all three of their matches going into the clash at the Azadi Stadium and were unfortunate not to go into halftime with a lead. Kim twice denied the home side in quick succession as Sardar Azmoun's low shot was parried to his left by the Kashiwa Reysol goalkeeper before another fine save - this time to his right - kept out Mehdi Taremi's overhead kick. Those interventions were to prove crucial three minutes into the second half when Son netted with a trademark finish. The Tottenham Hotspur forward was unstoppable as he latched onto a ball from inside the centre circle by Lee Jae-sung that evaded full back Sadegh Moharrami and Son coolly stroked the ball home. Saeed Ezatolahi hit the post from distance as Iran pushed to maintain their early dominance in Group A and, with 14 minutes remaining, Skocic's side were level. A determined Azmoun cut a lofted ball back from the bye-line and Alireza Jahanbakhsh powered his downward header beyond the outstretched arms of Kim. Taremi then hit the post from distance with an unstoppable drive while substitute Na Sang-ho was denied a dramatic winner by Alireza Beiranvand deep into stoppage time.

sports,FINA to establish integrity unit as part of reforms," Oct 11 (Reuters) - The International Swimming Federation (FINA) FINA's Reform Committee published a report recommending changes to address concerns over the governing body's operational independence and possible conflicts of interest in handling anti-doping violations. The Committee recommended reforms in six key areas, including the creation of an Aquatics Integrity Unit (AIU) to oversee anti-doping, event manipulation and corruptible offences and ethical violations. FINA has been urged by the Committee to disband its Doping Panel in favour of prosecuting potential violations before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and to create an Adjudicatory Chamber to replace the current Ethics Panel. ""For years, FINA has been criticized for the way in which it handles not only alleged anti-doping rule violations, but all other matters of integrity such as ethical violations and corruptible offences,"" the ""Alleged offences were referred to the respected adjudicatory body in clandestine fashion, often without explanation (of) why certain matters were considered alleged offences and others were not. ""The adjudicatory bodies within FINA ??while facially independent ??were not operationally independent from FINA. Athletes, in particular, have had little faith in the integrity of the FINA anti-doping, adjudication and ethical system."" Further recommendations include an overhaul of FINA's existing marketing strategy, reviewing its current events calendar, increasing prize money and having greater diversity in its Executive Boards and Committees. FINA said it was hopeful the AIU would become operational in June next year, subject to approval during an Extraordinary Congress in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 18. ""Aquatics athletes and those who support them deserve the very best in terms of integrity protections, whether for anti-doping, competition manipulation, harassment, abuse or other ethical violations,"" FINA executive director Brent Nowicki said. ""That is exactly what FINA is determined to put in place. The proposal to create an Aquatics Integrity Unit is a clear sign of FINA's determination to prioritise the protection and wellbeing of aquatics sport participants.""

Van der Merwe, 41, and F1 doctor Ian Roberts tested positive independently for the coronavirus ahead of the race and did not travel to Istanbul, with the FIA's Formula E crew standing in. Both had been in the medical car at the previous Russian Grand Prix in Sochi. The South African said on Twitter it was the second time he had contracted COVID-19 and he had not been vaccinated for personal reasons. ""From what we understand, there are a couple of countries that you probably won't be allowed to enter ... unless you're  vaccinated,"" Formula One's race director Michael Masi told reporters on Sunday. ""You need to comply with those requirements to enter the country and from that perspective the FIA obviously has to respect the country's requirements to get in, as will all the teams and everyone else."" Van der Merwe explained his position before the weekend, indicating he had received abuse on social media for his stance and would block those making personal attacks or wishing him fired. ""I am fully aware that I will potentially be less employable or that my freedom of movement will be restricted based on my choices,"" he said on Twitter. ""That I will not choose convenience over my own health does not mean I am making decisions out of selfishness. We all just want to be healthy."" He said he would continue to observe public health guidelines, reduce risk as much as possible, and respect the decisions of others. The remaining races this season are in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. ""In Switzerland (I?�m half Swiss) and other developed countries, prior infection counts as much as a vaccine,"" said van der Merwe.

""We have the quality but we also have to grow together as a team and we have to use every available training session to do that. We are on the right track but still have work to do."" Germany have won all five matches under new coach Hansi Flick, who replaced Joachim Loew following their disappointing performances in their last two international tournaments. Flick, who took over in September following his successful stint at Bayern Munich, seems to have found the right mix of youth and experience, with veteran Thomas Mueller indispensable once more after having been dropped by Loew for two years. They have scored 18 goals and conceded four in their last five matches. Although their opponents - Liechtenstein, Armenia, Romania, Iceland and North Macedonia - have been far from European heavyweights, they are raising the fans' expectations.

sports,Korea short track champion Shim barred from training with team mates," SEOUL, Oct 12 (Reuters) - South Korea's double Olympic short track gold medallist Shim Suk-hee has been excluded from training with the national team amid a probe into text messages she sent during the 2018 Games that suggested she may have intended to take down a team mate. An online newspaper last week revealed messages exchanged between Shim and a coach during the Games in which she ridiculed her team mate Choi Min-jeong and said she might try to create a ""female Steven Bradbury"" if things were not going her way. Australian Bradbury won gold in the men's 1,000m at the 2002 Winter Olympics after all the other competitors crashed at the last turn. In the 2018 women's 1,000m final in Pyeongchang, Shim and Choi became tangled up and fell over at the final corner, with Shim being disqualified and Choi finishing fourth. Yonhap news agency reported on Monday that the Korea Skating Union (KSU) planned to investigate whether there had been any intent on Shim's part. The report said the KSU had ""separated"" her from the national team at a training centre in the central city of Jincheon where they are preparing for qualifiers for the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Shim will not be able to compete at the International Skating Union (ISU) Short Track Speed Skating World Cup, which is scheduled to begin in Beijing on Oct. 21 and determines quotas for the upcoming Olympics, the report said. ""We've concluded after consulting the athletes, including Shim herself, and coaches that it would be difficult to train together in this situation,"" a KSU official was quoted as saying. The KSU was immediately available for comment. Shim apologised on Monday while Choi's management agency has called for an investigation. ""I'd like to sincerely apologise for disappointing and hurting many people with my immature actions and words,"" Shim said. However, she denied taking down Choi on purpose, saying it was ""just unfortunate we crashed into each other"".

The seven-times world champion, who started 11th on the grid due to engine penalties, was running in third place when he was told to pit for a tyre change, against his wishes of staying out in a bid to catch up with Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Hamilton responded angrily over the radio when he discovered he had lost two places in the pits as he finished fifth, allowing Verstappen to build a lead of six points in the drivers' standings with six races left. ""Don't ever expect me to be all polite and calm on the radio when I'm racing, we are all very passionate and in the heat of the moment that passion can come out, as it does for all drivers,"" Hamilton wrote on Instagram on Monday.

sports,Mbappe winner as France beat Spain in Nations League final," MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - World champions France won the Nations League final with goals from Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbappe earning them a 2-1 win over Spain at the San Siro stadium on Sunday. Didier Deschamps side had struggled to get a foothold in the game during a first half dominated by Spain but after going a goal down, following Mikel Oyarzabal's strike, they came alive. With Paul Pogba excellent in midfield, Mbappe's speed and movement stretching Spain and Benzema a constant threat, the French were good value for their victory. ""We showed our character against a very strong team. We never gave up,"" said Benzema. ""It shows what great teams do -- never panic, be patient and wait for the right time."" Luis Enrique's young Spain side, who had beaten European champions Italy in the semi-finals, had played their trademark possession football with patience and precision but in the end could not compensate for the absence of a genuine striker. ""It was a difficult defeat,"" said Spain's France-born defender Aymeric Laporte. ""We have proven to be a great team despite our youth, we have shown better football than them, but what counts is the result.??The first half was a relatively subdued affair with Spain moving the ball well but without dangerous penetration while France were disrupted by the loss to injury of centre-half Raphael Varane. But both sides were awoken after the break when France full-back Theo Hernandez thundered a shot against the underside of the bar after a swift break. Spain responded to that warning in clinical fashion, taking the lead when Oyarzabal latched on to a long pass from Sergio Busquets, held off Dayot Upamecano and fired into the bottom corner. The French response was swift, however, with Mbappe finding Benzema who cut inside before unleashing a brilliant curling shot into the far corner to make it 1-1. Mbappe then grabbed the winner, 10 minutes from the end, racing on to a through ball from Hernandez and keeping his cool to slot past Unai Simon. Spain protested that Mbappe was offside when he received the ball but the VAR check found a slight touch from defender Eric Garcia had played the France striker onside. France had keeper Hugo Lloris to thank for two late saves as Deschamps's side held on for the victory against intense Spanish pressure. Lloris got down well to keep out a low shot from Oyarzabal in the 89th minute and then in stoppage time he reacted superbly to parry a strike from substitute Yeremi Pino. Nations League, in just its second edition, remains clearly UEFA's secondary tournament for national sides, as the Italian fans singing of their team's Euro 2020 triumph reminded, but that didn't dampen France's celebrations. ""We did not get off to a good start we were dominated and waited until the first goal to react,"" said Pogba, who was crucial to France's response. ""We know we have to do better. But if it's the way we have to win, so be it. Winning a trophy is always good. We're always hungry for those,"" he added. Earlier on Sunday, Italy had claimed third-place in the Final Four tournament by beating Belgium 2-1 in Turin.

Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, has introduced a vaccine mandate for all professional athletes but authorities have yet to clarify whether athletes from overseas or other Australian states must also vaccinate. Victoria sports minister Martin Pakula urged players to leave no room for doubt. ""If I was an ATP or WTA player, I'd be getting vaccinated,"" Pakula told local radio station SEN. ""That will give them the best opportunity to play in the Australian Open with the more minimal restrictions that might be in place for those people."" Both the women's WTA and men's ATP tours have urged players to get vaccinated but some have expressed reservations, including Australian Open men's champion Novak Djokovic, who is opposed to vaccine mandates. Tennis Australia, which organises the Grand Slam, has not disclosed any arrangements for players for the upcoming tournament in January. But fully vaccinated players are expected to enjoy more freedoms to move around and may be able to avoid the country's mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival. Australia's borders remain effectively shut to non-residents, and Pakula said he did not know whether unvaccinated people would be allowed to enter the country by the time of the Australian Open which starts Jan. 17. ""That's going to be the subject, I suspect, of discussion at national cabinet and amongst the federal cabinet,"" he said. ""As for the rules that might apply around the Australian Open, specifically, we're in discussions with Tennis Australia and the department of health about that.""

Kipruto, who won the Prague Marathon in May, pulled away with less than 10 kilometres to go and had secured a commanding 41-second lead heading into the last mile, absorbing the cheers along Boylston Street as he broke the tape in two hours, nine minutes and 51 seconds. Ethiopians Lemi Berhanu and Jemal Yimer finished second and third, respectively. In the women's race, a crowded pack stuck together through the first 25 kilometres before Kipyogei, who won the Istanbul Marathon in 2020, made her move, securing a 10-second lead over the rest of the field by the 30-kilometre mark.

Ukraine's Svitolina, who won the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics, saved 12 of the 16 break point opportunities Cirstea set up in the two-hour-and-32-minute contest, and had to fight back from 4-2 down in the third set to survive.

""Mental health support, it's always been like a close topic for me, so I want to, for the first time, do something (in) that direction to help someone, some people,"" Swiatek said.

sports,More emails surface as NFL monitors Jon Gruden situation," 2021-10-12 00:31:56 GMT+00:00 - More emails from Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden emails were forwarded by the NFL to the team after a racially sensitive communication surfaced last week, ESPN reported Monday. According to the report, the NFL is monitoring the situation to see how the Raiders handle the situation. In a report Friday from the Wall Street Journal, Gruden used racist language in a 2011 email when describing the appearance of DeMaurice Smith, the Black executive director of the NFLPA. Gruden was working as ESPN's color commentator for ""Monday Night Football"" at the time the initial email in question was sent. The newspaper reached Gruden for comment, and he apologized while saying he did not recall writing the email in question. ""I'm really sorry,"" he said. Gruden again apologized Sunday after the Raiders were upset 20-9 by the Chicago Bears. Also on Sunday, he admitted to writing a series of emails a decade ago that disparaged NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and criticized several team owners. ""I can't tell you how sick I am,"" Gruden said. ""I apologize again to De Smith. But I feel good about who I am, what I've done my entire life. And I apologize for the insensitive remarks I had. I had no racial intentions with those remarks at all. ... I'm not like that at all. But I apologize."" According to the Journal, the league uncovered the email while reviewing 650,000 emails during its investigation into the Washington Football Team's workplace culture. It is unclear whether Gruden will face punishment from the league or the Raiders. ""The email from Jon Gruden denigrating DeMaurice Smith is appalling, abhorrent and wholly contrary to the NFL's values,"" the NFL said in a statement. ""We condemn the statement and regret any harm that its publication may inflict on Mr. Smith or anyone else."" Smith, who has served as the players association's executive director since 2009, told the Journal that it was ""not the first racist comment that I've heard, and it probably will not be the last."" Smith further addressed the subject on social media Monday. ""The email from Jon Gruden - and some of the reaction to it - confirms that the fight against racism, racist tropes and intolerance is not over,"" Smith said in a four-post thread on Twitter. ""This is not about an email as much as it is about a pervasive belief by some that people who look like me can be treated as less."" --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,"Lightning eye rare Stanley Cup three-peat, Kraken set to launch"," Oct 11 (Reuters) - The 2021-22 NHL season begins this week with most arenas back at full capacity, the Tampa Bay Lightning launching their quest to become the first team since 1983 to win three straight Stanley Cup championships and the debut of the Seattle Kraken. The season will feel closer to normal for the NHL after COVID-19 forced the previous campaign to be shortened, played with realigned divisions in a bid to limit travel and most games taking place without fans. While the pandemic will continue to be a challenge for the NHL, the league's high vaccination rate among its players allows for a comparably normal season during which fans will have to follow state and local guidance on COVID-19 protocols. Despite a significant squad turnover, the Lightning will retain the bulk of their key contributors -- including Nikita Kucherov, Steven Stamkos and Andrei Vasilevskiy -- that helped the team repeat as champions. The Lightning will kick off the season on Tuesday when they raise their Stanley Cup banner to the rafters before hosting the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday as part of a double-header that will be followed by Seattle at the Vegas Golden Knights. The Kraken, named after a mythical sea creature, are the NHL's 32nd team and are already drawing comparisons to the Vegas squad that made an improbable run to the 2018 Stanley Cup Final in the franchise's inaugural season. Seattle have assembled an experienced squad built around 38-year-old Mark Giordano who, as a three-time All-Star and former Norris Trophy winner as the NHL's top defenceman, will be counted on to provide leadership. Plenty of eyes will be on the Toronto Maple Leafs, who blew a commanding 3-1 series lead to Montreal in the first round of the 2021 playoffs when their high-powered attack fell flat. Despite the lack of offensive firepower in the playoffs, the Maple Leafs have remained committed to their core group of forwards in Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, John Tavares and William Nylander. ""There's no forgetting and there's learning to move it forward,"" said Sheldon Keefe, who is entering his third season as the Maple Leafs' head coach. ""We can recite the fact that we did a number of great things last season and we're not here to change the foundation as we laid as a team last year."" The Montreal Canadiens' hopes of making a return trip to the Stanley Cup Final were dealt an early blow as goaltender Carey Price, who was stellar in Montreal's playoff run last year, voluntarily entered the NHL's player assistance programme. Price entered the programme -- which helps players and their families deal with issues including mental health and substance abuse -- for an unspecified reason and is expected to be out for at least a month. Some of the NHL's best-known players are nearing milestones this season with Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin 36 goals away from tying Jaromir Jagr for third on the all-time goals list (766). Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby is 14 goals from becoming the 46th player in NHL history with 500. The season will include a three-week break to accommodate the participation of NHL players in the Feb. 4-20 Beijing Winter Olympics.

sports,Germany qualify for 2022 World Cup with North Macedonia win," SKOPJE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Germany became the first European team to qualify for the 2022 World Cup by crushing North Macedonia 4-0 away on Monday to secure top spot in Group J with two games to spare. A second-half double by Timo Werner and one goal each from Kai Havertz and Jamal Musiala secured Germany's fifth win in their fifth game under new coach Hansi Flick and lifted them to 21 points, with Romania in second place on 13. All group winners in European qualification automatically secure a place at the tournament in Qatar. ""From the result it was perfect. We got what we wanted, qualified as quickly as possible and we now have five wins in a row,"" Flick, who succeeded Joachim Loew earlier this year, said. ""Again the attitude was right. Compliments to the team. They did not ease off. The first half was a bit wild and we lacked a bit of precision. But we kept at it. We can be satisfied."" The Germans, who were eliminated in the first round of the 2018 World Cup and the last 16 at this year's Euros, had an early chance with a Thomas Mueller header. But, as in their 2-1 home win over Romania on Friday, the Germans lacked precision with their final pass and finishing, creating only a handful of chances in the first half until  Werner hit the post with a low drive in stoppage time. Germany, beaten 2-1 by North Macedonia in March, broke the deadlock in the 50th minute when Serge Gnabry split the defence with a superb through ball for Mueller and he laid it off for Havertz to tap in. Forward Werner then scored twice in three minutes, first drilling in from another Mueller assist in the 70th and then curling a shot home from 15 metres three minutes later. ""It was difficult at the start but it was good we did not concede a goal,"" Werner, who has now netted in four of the five matches under Flick. ""We know that if we push and attack over 90 minutes then it is only a matter of time until we score. After the lead it was easier for us."" Substitute Musiala completed the victory seven minutes before the end with his first international goal.

sports,Verstappen is back on top but Hamilton picking up speed," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Max Verstappen took back the Formula One world championship lead from Lewis Hamilton at Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix but champions Mercedes have got faster and alarm bells are ringing at Red Bull. The 24-year-old Dutch driver finished second to Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas at the Istanbul Park circuit to move six points clear of seven-times world champion Hamilton, who ended up fifth. At the same time Red Bull fell further behind Mercedes in the constructors' standings, the gap now 36 points, and team boss Christian Horner expressed surprise at how much his rivals had picked up the pace. ""I think their straight-line speed has taken a significant step recently,"" he told reporters. ""Whereas we could match them with smaller wings previously now we can't get near. ""We saw that particularly at this circuit where Lewis in particular had a significant straight-line advantage with a bigger rear wing on the car. We've got to maximise our package as best we can. ""It's surprising that they appear to have made the step that they have with the power unit."" Verstappen told reporters Red Bull needed to find more pace. ""They were definitely quicker this weekend,"" he said. ""We just didn't get it together and also in the wet they seemed to have a bit of the edge as well. ""I definitely do think they probably stepped it up a bit,"" he added. Hamilton had been fastest in qualifying in Istanbul and would have started on pole position had his car's engine not been changed as a precaution, triggering a 10 place grid penalty. ""We haven't done anything to the car so I don't really know why that is the case,"" the Briton, who took his record-extending 100th career win at the previous race in Russia, said when asked about the improved performance. ""Maybe the two tracks we've just driven on suited us a little bit more. The car's been feeling good, it felt great this weekend. ""If the car continues to behave as it has this weekend, that's good for us."" The last three circuits -- Italy's Monza, Russia's Sochi and Turkey -- have all been good ones for Mercedes in recent years but Red Bull have hung in there and come away with strong results to limit the damage. While Mercedes-engined cars won all three races, it was Australian Daniel Ricciardo at Monza in a McLaren one-two after Verstappen and Hamilton took each other out. Verstappen finished second in the other two, crucially ahead of Hamilton in Istanbul with team mate Sergio Perez third and Bottas no threat in the championship. ""Arguably this has been Mercedes' strongest circuit that we've seen so far this season so to have two cars on the podium and retake the lead in the drivers' championship is a positive day for us,"" said Horner. ""We know the next race in Austin has been a Hamilton stronghold for quite a few years now but then Mexico, Brazil hopefully, the higher altitude races have tended to be quite strong for us in the past. ""And then really not sure what to expect from the last three."" Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the races before the finale in Abu Dhabi, are both new to Formula One.

sports,'When will we get a rest? Never' - Courtois lashes out over number of games," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Belgium and Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has launched a scathing criticism of UEFA and FIFA for scheduling more and more matches at the expense of player welfare. Courtois hit out at the growing football calendar after his side's 2-1 defeat by Italy in the UEFA Nations' League third-place playoff, labelling the match, in which both teams rotated their squads, a ""money game"". ""We are not robots. It's just more and more games and less rest for us and nobody cares about us. When will we get a rest? Never,"" Courtois said. The football calendar has been squeezed in the last 18 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Champions League and many of the continent's top leagues taking place in shorter spaces of time but with the same amount of matches. The European Championship and Copa America were both held at the end of the gruelling season and there is to be no let up in the near future. Next year's World Cup takes place between November and December -- in the middle of the club season -- while the Nations League finals will be held in June 2023. FIFA, meanwhile, wishes to hold an expanded Club World Cup and its head of Global Football Development, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, has outlined proposals for a biennial World Cup. ""Next year we have a World Cup in November, we have to play maybe until the latter stages of June again. We will get injured,"" added Courtois. ""So in the end top players will get injured and injured and injured. It's something that should be much better and much more taken care of."" UEFA has opposed the plan for more frequent World Cups and the proposed European Super League, but Courtois said the European organising body was not interested in player welfare either as they too keep adding to the fixture calendar. ""They are against Super League but they just do the same, they put extra games. They made an extra trophy, (Europa Conference League). It is always the same,"" added the Belgian. ""They can be angry about other teams wanting a Super League but they don't care about the players, they just care about their pockets."" UEFA did not immediately respond to comments from Courtois. The Nations League was launched in 2018 with the aim of offering more competitive matches for the continent's teams instead of international friendlies. The Europa Conference League, which began this season, was created in order to increase the number of UEFA member nations playing in European competitions.

The 23-year-old, nicknamed ""Ironman Im"", carded a final round of nine-under 62 to seal a four-shot win over American Matthew Wolff as he went 24-under for the tournament at TPC Summerlin. Im's maiden triumph on the Tour was at The Honda Classic in March 2020 and he said his latest win was ""very meaningful."" ""I know I won my first win on my 50th start and to win my second PGA Tour win on my 100th start, that in itself is a pretty amazing stat,"" said Im, the second youngest winner of the event after 1996 champion Tiger Woods. ""It was hard coming, but I think today how everything went, I think it was a gift from above. I played so well and I'm glad I got the win. It was tough to win the first one and I thought the second would be harder. ""I just kept my patience and tried to keep my focus throughout the period."" Im said he will turn his attention to this week's CJ Cup, a PGA Tour event that is being played in Las Vegas for a second straight year after being moved out of South Korea due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I want to celebrate today's win, so tonight and probably tomorrow I want to take a break. But starting Tuesday morning I want to prepare for the CJ Cup,"" Im said.

The Greek broke serve to take a 2-0 lead in the opening set which he claimed with ease, but he was made to work much harder in the next set by his unseeded opponent. World number 61 Martinez, who lost the pair's only previous meeting in straight sets at Roland Garros earlier this year, was determined to push Tsitsipas all the way as he raced ahead 3-1 in the second set with an early break. But French Open runner-up Tsitsipas quickly found his rhythm again to claw his way back and close out the contest in style. ""Well it's been a great night for me. The first time playing a night session here on this court,"" Tsitsipas, making only his third appearance in the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in the Southern California desert, said. Tsitsipas fired 23 winners, including 12 in the second set, and made only six unforced errors in the match. ""I'm pretty happy with the way I fought and found a way to clinch that victory at the end,"" Tsitsipas said, before turning his attention to Italian Fognini, who went through with a 6-4 4-6 6-3 win over German Jan-Lennard Struff. ""I've played Fognini before,"" Tsitsipas added of their two previous meetings, both of which the Greek won in straight sets. ""I'm looking forward to that match.""

sports,Murray says Raducanu's defeat at Indian Wells a 'little bump'," Oct 10 (Reuters) - Emma Raducanu's defeat in her first match since winning the  U.S. Open was a ""little bump"", fellow Briton Andy Murray said, backing the 18-year-old to deal with expectations and disappointment in a mature way. Qualifier Raducanu did not drop a set in 10 matches en route to the title at Flushing Meadows last month but lost 6-2 6-4 on Friday to Aliaksandra Sasnovich in the second round of the Indian Wells tournament in California. ""What happened in New York was obviously incredible but in tennis and sport it doesn't just go in an upwards direction all the time,"" former world number one Murray told reporters. ""There's always little bumps and stuff along the way. It's just a little bump, but I think pretty much everyone was sort of expecting that as well. I don't think it's anything unexpected, to be honest."" ""She's unbelievably bright, well educated and stuff,"" Murray said. ""So you would imagine she would certainly be a lot better equipped to deal with everything that's going on than most and deal with it in a more mature way than I'd have done when I was 18."" Murray fended off a challenge from 18-year-old U.S. Open quarter-finalist Carlos Alcaraz of Spain to win 5-7 6-3 6-2 and reach the third round on Sunday. His former coach Darren Cahill tweeted that it was the 34-year-old's best performance since having hip surgeries in 2018 and 2019. ""It wasn't easy out there today. Not easy conditions. Very hot. Court is incredibly slow. Balls after a couple of games are also extremely slow,"" said three-times Grand Slam champion Murray, who faces Alexander Zverev next. ""Not easy to finish points.

sports,Panama stun U.S. 1-0 in World Cup qualifier," Oct 10 (Reuters) - Panama won their first-ever World Cup qualifying match against the United States in Panama City on Sunday, picking up a 1-0 victory in CONCACAF qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. The U.S. side couldn't find its rhythm and a header from midfielder Anibal Godoy following a corner kick in the 54th minute gave Panama the advantage to roars from the home crowd. Godoy was taken off on a stretcher in the 67th minute with an injury and a collision between American Kellyn Acosta and Panamanian Armando Cooper late in the second half led to an extended stoppage of play as medical trainers tended to each on the pitch. Moments later, Panama midfielder Christian Martinez was also taken off the field with an apparent leg issue. ""It was clear we didn't have our best stuff,"" coach Gregg Berhalter told reporters. ""I think we came up short in a number of areas."" Berhalter said the focus would pivot now to ""regrouping"" for Wednesday's match against Costa Rica. ""Overall, we performed below the expectations we have for ourselves,"" he added. The match took place four years to the day since the United States suffered a humiliating 2-1 defeat to Trinidad & Tobago that caused them to miss the 2018 World Cup, the first time they failed to reach the tournament since 1986. The loss on Sunday dropped the United States to second in the qualifying table, after opening the round with two draws and beating Honduras and Jamaica.

sports,COVID snags could see Australian Open join summer sports scrapheap," MELBOURNE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Australia's hopes of rebooting its golf tour remain thwarted by COVID-19 and its premier event may be a casualty of the pandemic for a second year running, Golf Australia boss James Sutherland told Reuters. The country's biggest tournaments were cancelled last year and this year's have been pushed back to early-2022 but organisers remain hamstrung by strict travel curbs and quarantine rules. Australia's borders are effectively shut and unlikely to open to non-residents until 2022, while the mandatory 14-day isolation in quarantine hotels is putting off the nation's top players from returning home to support the domestic tour. That adds up to a nightmare for tournament organisers whose supply of talent required to sign sponsors and sell tickets has been all but choked off. ""The uncertainty sort of puts us in a difficult situation,"" Sutherland said in an interview on Monday. ""From our perspective, we are just trying to get a little bit of certainty as to what things look like and may look like. ""There?�s usually a bit of crystal balling there but unfortunately these players tend to make arrangements a long way in advance."" The flagship Australian Open, which boasts former world number ones Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy among its recent winners, was pencilled in for late-January or early February last month after its November scheduling proved untenable. Both the Australian Open and the 2022 women's event in Adelaide in February, which is also a stop on the elite LPGA Tour, are now in doubt. ""We?�ve just got to now weigh up what do the events look like and is it possible to play at some lesser scale?"" said Sutherland. ""They?�re the sorts of things we?�re trying to work through at the moment."" The loss of the tournaments would be another hammer blow for the local tour, while adding to a growing list of cancelled sport events in Australia. Melbourne's Formula One Australian Grand Prix was postponed from its traditional March window to a November slot before being scrapped for a second year, along with motorcycling's MotoGP event at nearby Phillip Island. Road cycling's Tour Down Under, a race on the top UCI World Tour, was cancelled last month, and there are doubts over whether the team-based ATP Cup tennis tournament can go ahead before the Australian Open Grand Slam at Melbourne Park in January. Even organising small golf events for home-based players desperate for competition is proving a huge challenge for administrators, with Australia's southeastern states effectively isolated from the rest of the country while battling COVID-19 outbreaks. ""(That's) another layer of complexity with state borders and how players can move themselves around,"" said Sutherland. ""For players, time is money and they can?�t afford two weeks in quarantine.""

sports,"Bottas wins in Turkey, title advantage to Verstappen"," ISTANBUL, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Valtteri Bottas ended his year-long drought with a dominant victory in Turkey on Sunday while unhappy Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton finished fifth and lost the Formula One championship lead to Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Verstappen, 24, was runner-up and 14.584 seconds behind the Finn at a wet Istanbul Park to overturn a two-point deficit to Hamilton and go six points clear with six races remaining. Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez finished third with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc fourth and ahead of seven-times world champion Hamilton, who had started 11th due to an engine penalty. ""It's been a while, but feels good. I think from my side probably one of the best races I've had ever,"" said Bottas, who started on pole position and took a bonus point for fastest lap. ""Apart from that one little slide, everything was under control."" The victory, sealed by overtaking Leclerc 11 laps from the end after the Ferrari driver had taken the lead by staying out while others pitted, was the Finn's first since Russia in September last year and 10th of his career. Verstappen, who started on the front row, had a quiet race and said it had all been about tyre management. ""I'm happy to be on the podium. I think it's been close the whole year and I'm pretty sure in Austin it will be a good battle with Mercedes, so we just have to keep pushing, keep trying,"" he said. The U.S. Grand Prix in Texas is the next race on Oct. 24. HEATED HAMILTON Hamilton might have been on the podium but Mercedes called him in for a late stop from third place for a fresh set of intermediate tyres with the track drying. ""Why did we give up that place? We shouldn't have come in, man. Massive (tyre) graining. I told you,"" said the angry Briton in heated radio exchanges as he realised he had lost two places in the pits. He noted afterwards that Alpine driver Esteban Ocon, who finished 10th, had made his one set of tyres last the entire race. Had he stayed out and kept third, Hamilton would be only a point behind Verstappen. ""We thought we could finish third without stopping or, if a dry line emerged, maybe going to a soft tyre,"" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. ""Then we saw Leclerc dropping off and Lewis was dropping off and it was clear we wouldn't make it to the end."" Pirelli boss Mario Isola said the tyres would have been absolutely on the limit had Hamilton tried to last the entire race on them. Spaniard Carlos Sainz was voted driver of the day for going from the back of the grid, due to power unit penalties, to eighth for Ferrari. AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly was sixth with Lando Norris seventh for McLaren and Lance Stroll ninth for Aston Martin. ALONSO PENALTY The start was clean but Gasly dropped from fourth to fifth after contact with Alpine's Fernando Alonso, who spun. The Frenchman was handed a five-second time penalty but Alonso also collected a similar sanction for a later clash with Haas's Mick Schumacher. Bottas was 1.6 seconds clear after three laps with Verstappen complaining soon after that he had problems with the gear shift. Hamilton meanwhile worked his way through the field, 10th after the opening lap before passing AlphaTauri's stubbornly defensive Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda for eighth place on lap eight. He passed Stroll a lap later, with Norris and Gasly taken in quick succession. A worrying moment came at the halfway mark when he was lapping Haas rookie Nikita Mazepin only for the Russian to move across the track, the two cars avoiding contact but Hamilton losing time in his chase of Perez. Hamilton and Perez went wheel-to-wheel through four corners as they fought for fourth, with the Mexican forced to run the wrong side of a bollard marking the pitlane entry as he held position and his team applauded. With Ferrari finally recognising Leclerc had run out of tyres after Bottas passed him, the Monegasque pitted and was overtaken by Perez.

Rashford's penalty miss in the shootout against Italy ultimately cost England the title at Wembley. The 23-year-old's young team mates, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, were also targeted after missing their spot kicks. A Rashford mural in Manchester was defaced too but the community came together and left messages of support to cover up the vandalism and the player said that was a ""special moment"". ""It's nice to have that support from different types of people. It's probably something that I've not really experienced before,"" Rashford told the BBC. ""You never want to get that far in the tournament and then get to the final game and lose. But to lose on penalties it's such, such fine margins. ""But there's never a time that racism is acceptable, or we should accept racism and just get on with our lives. But probably on the biggest stage that racism has been in front of us as young players, it was nice to see so many people supporting us without us even saying anything."" Rashford has been sidelined ever since after undergoing surgery for a shoulder injury he said he had been carrying since September last year but is on the comeback trail after returning to full training. ""My recovery is, I wouldn't say coming to an end because obviously I have to keep looking after it, but I'm in a much better place physically and mentally,"" he said. Rashford also said he was looking forward to playing with Cristiano Ronaldo having been a fan of the 36-year-old during his first stint at the Old Trafford club.

sports,Fury defeats Wilder with 11th round knockout to retain WBC title," Oct 9 (Reuters) - Tyson Fury retained his WBC heavyweight title on Saturday when he sent Deontay Wilder to the canvas for a third time with a vicious right hand to the head in the 11th round at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The enthralling slugfest was more competitive than many expected but still ended as most predicted, with the Briton outboxing the American to remain the undefeated lineal champion. After losing the WBC belt to Fury 20 months ago in a one-sided bout, Wilder was the aggressor early, using his jab to back up the larger Fury while seizing on every opportunity to throw his powerful right hand. Fury weathered the early storm and knocked Wilder down in the third round with a short uppercut but the American responded in the fourth, knocking Fury down twice with shots to the head from close range. But like he did when he was knocked down in the 12th round of their first meeting, Fury absorbed the punishment and picked himself up. From there, Fury took control and bludgeoned Wilder, knocking him off his feet in the 10th round before ending the brutal affair with a clean right hand to the side of his head that sent Wilder face-first into the canvas. Although down on the score cards, the fight never felt completely out of reach for Wilder (42-2-1, 41 KOs) due to his right hand but the defensive-minded Fury mostly managed to avoid it. With the win, Fury (31-0-1) has now taken two of the three meetings between the rivals after the first fight ended in a draw and Fury dominated the second. ""It was a great fight tonight, it was worthy of any trilogy in the history of the sport,"" Fury said on Saturday. ""Deontay Wilder's a top fighter, he gave me a real run for my money. I always said I'm the best in the world and he's second best."" Fury serenaded the crowd after the bout with a rendition of ""Walking in Memphis."" The battered Wilder reportedly went to hospital immediately after the fight. DOUBTS ON READINESS SETTLED Before the fight, which was moved from its original July 24 date after Fury contracted COVID-19, there were questions about Fury's readiness. Fury and wife Paris welcomed a baby girl nearly two months ago but she had to be placed into the hospital's intensive care unit. He said he spent two weeks by her side before she came home but insisted he was in excellent condition. ""Don't ever doubt me. When the chips are down, I can always deliver,"" Fury said. It is unclear what is next for Fury. Ukraine's Oleksandr Usyk holds the other three titles and the winner of a fight between the two would lead to the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis 21 years ago. That fight may have to wait, however, as Britain's Anthony Joshua earlier in the day triggered his clause for a rematch against Usyk, who defeated him last month to take the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO belts. ""We'll see. I've just earned a well-earned break from everything. I've been away from me family, I've only been home for two weeks over the past six months,"" he told a press conference.

sports,Messi scores unusual goal as Argentina beat Uruguay 3-0," BUENOS AIRES, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Two goals in the minutes before half time, one of them an unusually fortunate counter from Lionel Messi, helped Argentina on their way to a comfortable 3-0 win over Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier on Sunday. Eight minutes before the break Messi floated a 35-meter pass into the area but it was missed by both advancing striker Nicolas Gonzalez and goalkeeper Fernando Muslera and somehow sneaked into the net. Six minutes later Lautaro Martinez swung and missed at a chance on the edge of the box but the loose ball fell into the path of Rodrigo De Paul who made no mistake. Martinez made up for the miss when he converted a low cross from De Paul 17 minutes into the second half. ""We played a great game,"" said Messi. ""Everything worked out perfectly.??""Uruguay wait for you and they generate danger. Once we got the first goal we started to find space and the goals appeared.??The win, combined with Brazil?�s 0-0 draw at Colombia earlier in the day, narrows the gap between leaders Brazil and second-placed Argentina to six points at the top of the 10-team South American qualifying group. The top four teams qualify automatically for Qatar and the fifth-placed side go into an inter-regional playoff. Uruguay, who ended the day fourth in the 10-team table, were unbeaten in eight matches coming into Sunday?�s match. They took the game to their rivals, with Luis Suarez coming close on three occasions in the first half hour, including one thunderous shot that came back off the post. Argentina grew as the game went on, though, and Giovani Lo Celso missed a golden chance to open the scoring when he rounded the goalkeeper but delayed before striking a shot that hit the underside of the bar and the goal line before rolling to safety. After the home side drew first blood they never looked like losing an unbeaten run that now stands at 24 games. Edinson Cavani came on in the second half for Uruguay but it was Argentina who had the better chances in an entertaining game that featured only 15 fouls and no cautions. Messi came close to getting his second and substitute Angel Di Maria could have made it four on two occasions only to twice see Muslera parry his goalbound shots. Elsewhere, Chile won for the first time in eight qualifying matches to keep their slender hopes of qualifying for Qatar alive. Ben Brereton and Mauricio Isla scored in the 68th and 72nd minutes to lift the Chileans, who missed out on Russia in 2018, on to 11 points, just five behind fifth-placed Colombia. Charles Aranguiz was sent off two minutes later for the home side but Paraguay could not make their late advantage count and they had their own player sent off in the final minute when Omar Alderete saw red.

sports,Braves turn to Ian Anderson in crucial Game 3 vs. Brewers," 2021-10-10 17:20:10 GMT+00:00 - Ian Anderson will look to continue the Atlanta Braves' trend of strong starting pitching on Monday afternoon when they play Game 3 of their National League Division Series against the visiting Milwaukee Brewers. Charlie Morton tossed six scoreless innings before allowing a two-run homer to Rowdy Tellez in the seventh inning of an eventual 2-1 loss in the series opener on Friday. Max Fried also worked six scoreless frames Saturday as the Braves evened the set at one win apiece with a 3-0 win. On Monday, the best-of-five series shifts to Atlanta, although one has to wonder which team holds the advantage by playing at Truist Park. The Braves posted just a 42-38 record at home while the Brewers boasted a 50-31 mark to set a franchise record for road victories outside of Milwaukee. Austin Riley, who belted a solo homer on Saturday, said he thinks the Braves have the advantage. ""Going back home 0-2, you definitely don't want it. Getting a split here is all you can ask for,"" Riley told Bally Sports South and Southeast. ""Taking it home to our fans, they're excited. I know we are. I'm looking for it."" Anderson (9-5, 3.58 ERA) owns a 4-0 record in six starts since returning from a seven-week absence due to right shoulder inflammation. The right-hander has yielded two runs or fewer in three of his past four starts. Anderson, 23, flustered the Brewers in his lone start against them this season. He carried a no-hit bid into the seventh inning before allowing one run on two hits in an eventual 5-1 victory on May 15. Milwaukee needs to wake up its slumbering bats in a hurry to keep Atlanta from moving within one win of returning to the NL Championship Series for the second straight season. The Brewers are batting a paltry .183 (11-for-60, 24 strikeouts) while mustering just two runs in the first two games of the series. To be fair, the Braves are batting just .175 (11-for-63, 18 strikeouts). ""It's been a tough series to score runs for both sides,"" Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. ""It's two games. It's 1-1. It's a two-out-of-three series now. Everybody's going to be frustrated when you just miss a pitch that you feel like you had to hit, so I think that's natural. But I don't think offensively there's frustration."" Christian Yelich, who is 1-for-6 with two walks in the series, echoed that sentiment. ""It didn't really work out for us (on Saturday). But, it happens,"" Yelich said. ""We kept after it, kept putting the pressure on them, and they did a good job making pitches when they had to."" The Brewers have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Game 3. Right-hander Freddy Peralta (10-5, 2.81) is a likely choice, although he limped down the stretch in September. He posted a 1-2 record with a 4.70 ERA in five starts last month. Peralta, 25, certainly fared well in his lone start this season against Atlanta. He scattered two hits and struck out eight batters in six scoreless innings of a wild 10-9 victory on May 16. In four career appearances (three starts), Peralta owns a 2-1 record with a 4.41 ERA vs. the Braves. Ozzie Albies (1-for-7) and Freddie Freeman (2-for-9) have struggled in small sample sizes against Peralta. --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,"Zverev overcomes Brooksby at Indian Wells, qualifies for ATP Finals"," Oct 10 (Reuters) - World number four Alexander Zverev said he struggled to hit top gear against American Jenson Brooksby on Sunday, as he recovered from a flurry of mistakes in the second set to prevail 6-4 3-6 6-1 in the second round of Indian Wells. The German got the early break in the first set but lost some of his momentum in the second, winning fewer than half of his service points as 20-year-old Brooksby pounced, weeks after his run to the fourth round of the U.S. Open as a wildcard. But Zverev, who picked up a gold medal in Tokyo this summer, quickly found his composure, dropping just one first-serve point in the third set, where he never faced a break point, and launching 10 aces. ""The match wasn't the best level ever from me, but I won. I think the third set was starting to be pretty decent. I started to feel the ball a lot better,"" Zverev told reporters. The win meant the 24-year-old became the fourth singles player to qualify for next month's season-ending ATP Finals to be held in Turin, the men's tour said. ""I've had my best season so far and I'm really happy to have qualified,"" Zverev, who won the title in 2018 in London, added. Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Novak Djokovic have also booked their places in the tournament. Zverev's immediate focus will be on securing his third Masters 1000 title after winning the Madrid Open and the Cincinnati Masters this year. He next faces Briton Andy Murray, who defeated Spain's Carlos Alcaraz 5-7 6-3 6-2 in a three-hour, three-minute marathon on Sunday. ""The conditions aren't ideal for me I'd say. I've never done extremely well here. I'm going to try my best at the end of the day,"" Zverev added. ""Andy's playing great again. He's won two great matches. I think today was very high level from him. I'm looking forward to playing him. He's the only one out of the 'Big Four' I haven't beaten yet. I hope I can change that after tomorrow.""

Both men were neck and neck for much of the day and ended at 19-under for the tournament. Cabrera Bello then held his nerve after a fine approach shot on the first playoff hole -- the par-four 18th -- to make birdie as Arnaus could only manage par. ""I knew it was going to be a really hard battle today and I don't think I need to say that I didn't get off to the ideal start. It was definitely one trophy that was on my bucket list... It's very, very special,"" said Cabrera Bello. ""I've been believing in myself, I've had amazing support all this week rooting for me ever since the first minute and I was just hanging in there, I knew I'd have an opportunity and I'm glad that luck swung my way."" Frenchman Julien Guerrier, India's Shubhankar Sharma and Scot Grant Forrest were all two shots back at 17-under, finishing tied for third. World number one and home favourite Jon Rahm, who was chasing a hat-trick of titles at the event, endured another frustrating day as he carded a two-under 69 and 13-under overall that gave him a share of 17th place. Cabrera Bello, the overnight leader, began the round with a double-bogey on the par-four first but found his touch on the back nine, making three straight birdies starting with the 13th that gave him a two-under 69. Arnaus, on the other hand, made eagle on the 14th but could only par his last four holes to end with a round of 67. ""I came here in a pretty bad place with scores being not what I expect them to be, and to be able to get momentum and turn it around and to walk out of here with a win means a lot to me,"" added Cabrera Bello. The tournament was Cabrera Bello's fourth title on the European Tour while it left Arnaus still searching for his maiden win.

Ireland captain McCabe belted a vicious dipping volley over keeper Alexandra MacIver in the 32nd minute, and the left back then picked out Lotte Wubben-Moy to score from a corner nine minutes later. Everton posed little threat in attack and Frida Maanum scored the pick of the bunch for Arsenal late on, cutting inside before unleashing a right-foot rocket that burrowed its way into the top corner in the 87th minute. Earlier in the day champions Chelsea left it late in their 2-0 win over newcomers Leicester City, with Pernille Harder making the breakthrough for the Blues in the 83rd minute and Fran Kirby adding the second deep into stoppage time. Spurs, who started the day in second spot, conceded a goal in each half to Brighton and had forward Rachel Williams sent off for two yellow cards to slide to third in the table. Reading got their first win of the season with a 3-0 thumping of Aston Villa, while Birmingham City picked up their first point this term thanks to a 1-1 draw with West Ham United. Arsenal lead the league with a perfect 15 points from five games.

sports,Italy edge Belgium 2-1 to finish third in Nations League," TURIN, Italy, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Nicolo Barella?�s thunderous strike and a penalty converted by Domenico Berardi earned hosts Italy a 2-1 victory over Belgium on Sunday and third place in this year?�s Nations League. It offered some consolation for the European champions, whose semi-final loss to Spain in Milan on Wednesday ended their record 37-match unbeaten run. They returned to winning ways as Barella volleyed a poor corner clearance into the net one minute into the second half and Berardi added the second from the spot in the 65th minute, after Timothy Castagne had brought down the tricky Federico Chiesa. Belgium claimed a consolation in the 86th minute when substitute Charles De Ketelaere finished off a quick counter- attack. Belgium, who were without Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku and only brought on Kevin De Bruyne in the second half, hit the woodwork three times but were outplayed for large portions of the match by their hosts at the Juventus Stadium. ""Today we played very well, we were excellent. We have different solutions and quality in midfield, today they did well,"" Italy coach Roberto Mancini told RAI television. Early chances for Berardi and Giacomo Raspadori were dealt with by the Belgian defence before Alexis Saelemaekers, who plays in Serie A with AC Milan, slammed a shot against the Italian crossbar in the 28th minute. But immediately after the break, the Belgians fell behind to Barella?�s snap effort, cleanly hit after a clearing header from a corner fell perfectly into his path. Michy Batshuayi then had an effort come back off the woodwork as Belgium came close to a 60th minute equaliser but fell 2-0 behind when Castagne mistimed a tackle on Chiesa to offer Italy a chance to extend their lead from the penalty spot. Berardi?�s kick squeezed past Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Toby Alderweireld then proved an unlikely attacking threat with two efforts that brought out fine stops from Italy?�s goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma before Yannick Carrasco smashed a curling shot against the Italian post in the final 10 minutes. Courtois??quick clearance set up Belgium?�s goal with De Bruyne passing to the youthful De Ketelaere to squeeze it past Donnarumma from close range, but it came too late to offer a dramatic finish to the game. ""We had a lot of younger players today and they did decently,"" De Bruyne said. ""It was good for them to play against a team of Italy's quality.""

sports,Verstappen demands more pace after retaking F1 championship lead," ISTANBUL, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Max Verstappen played down his Formula One championship advantage on Sunday and said his Red Bull team needed to find more pace to fend off Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes in the last six races of the season. The championship lead has swung between Verstappen and Hamilton all season, with the title battle looking like it could go all the way to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December. Verstappen returned to the top with second place in the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday and the Dutch 24-year-old is now six points clear of seven times world champion Hamilton, who started the day in Istanbul two ahead. The race was won by Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas, with Hamilton fifth. ""We need to find more pace because six points is nothing. I wish I had more pace. It's going to be tough,"" Verstappen told Sky Sports television. Team boss Christian Horner agreed Red Bull had lagged in straight-line speed at a circuit where Mercedes looked the quickest they have been all year. Verstappen hoped the races to come -- three in the Americas and three in the Middle East -- would suit his car more than Mercedes. ""They were definitely quicker this weekend, we just didn't get it together,"" said the Dutch driver. ""On the wet they also seemed to have the edge. Even with the points lead, it's not going to be easy."" Verstappen, who has won seven times this year compared to Hamilton's five, said on Thursday the outcome of this season's title fight would not change his life either way. He said after Sunday's race that Red Bull would continue to fight for the title but that he ""won't be sleeping less"" if they were to lose out on the championship. ""We've had a really good year, so it's not going to change the world for me if we finish first or second at the end of the year,"" said the Dutchman.

sports,Team by team analysis of the Turkish Grand Prix," Oct 10 (Reuters) - Team by team analysis of Sunday's Turkish Formula One Grand Prix at the Istanbul Park circuit (listed in current championship order): MERCEDES (Valtteri Bottas 1, Lewis Hamilton 5) Bottas won from pole position and set the fastest lap. It was his first win in more than a year and 10th of his career. Hamilton started 11th on the grid, due to an engine penalty, and was third when he made a late pitstop, losing two places. From being two points clear of Verstappen in the championship he is now six behind. Mercedes are now 36 points clear of Red Bull, a gain of three points. RED BULL (Max Verstappen 2, Sergio Perez 3) Verstappen went back on top of the championship while Red Bull celebrated their second double podium finish of the season. The podium was Perez's first since France in June. Perez went wheel-to-wheel with Hamilton through four corners as they battled for fourth place in a highlight moment of the race. MCLAREN (Lando Norris 7, Daniel Ricciardo 13) McLaren's lead over Ferrari shrank by 10 points to 7.5. Ricciardo started at the back of the grid due to an engine change penalty and struggled with the tyres. The Australian had qualified 15th. Norris started seventh and said it had been a very long and tough race. FERRARI (Charles Leclerc 4, Carlos Sainz 8) Leclerc led once Bottas and Verstappen had pitted, staying out as long as he could before the tyres lost performance and he pitted on lap 47 of 58. Sainz was voted Driver of the Day for racing from 19th on the grid to eighth. He lost time in the pitstop, costing him a chance to attack Norris. ALPINE (Esteban Ocon 10, Fernando Alonso 16) Alonso made contact with Gasly at the first corner, spinning down the field. The Spaniard fought back but then banged into Schumacher's Haas and was handed a five second penalty. He came in for fresh intermediates on lap 31. Ocon did not pit, making one set of intermediate tyres last the entire race which is allowed under wet weather rules. ALPHATAURI (Pierre Gasly 6, Yuki Tsunoda 14) Gasly was handed a five second penalty for the clash with Alonso, for which he apologised, but still finished 10 seconds from the podium. Tsunoda wore down his tyres battling Hamilton early on and then spun, dropping out of the points. The team closed the gap to Alpine to 12 points. ASTON MARTIN (Lance Stroll 9, Sebastian Vettel 18) Vettel made a bold move to switch to slicks at his pitstop, which backfired and he had to pit again on the next lap to take on intermediates again. Otherwise he might have scored. Stroll lost some time in his pitstop but felt he got the most out of the car. WILLIAMS (George Russell 15, Nicholas Latifi 17) Russell started 13th and Latifi 15th and both made one stop. Russell lost positions at the start after Alonso's spin and a battle with Ocon. Latifi spun on the opening lap in what was his first fully wet race. He also lost time behind the Haas drivers. ALFA ROMEO (Antonio Giovinazzi 11, Kimi Raikkonen 12) The pair started 16th and 17th respectively but were 12th and 13th after the first lap. They passed Ricciardo with a lap remaining. HAAS (Mick Schumacher 19, Nikita Mazepin 20) Schumacher started 14th but the contact with Alonso sent him to the back of the field.

All aspects of the top-seeded Russian's game were clicking as he improved to 5-0 in head-to-head matches against the American. ""I'm actually really pleased, because usually I haven?�t played well in Indian Wells and I haven't been playing that well in practices before (the tournament),"" Medvedev said in his on-court interview. ""(I am) really happy with my performance. That's the most important (thing) no matter how I played before the tournament."" The 25-year-old Medvedev was sharp from the outset, breaking McDonald to open the match on a warm night in the Southern California desert. Medvedev's ability to cover the court despite his towering frame, an aspect of his game that was on full display when he won a 44-shot rally, proved too much for the challenger, who never really pushed the tournament favorite. Medvedev unleashed a blistering serve to McDonald's backhand on match point and the return sailed wide to end the affair. The Russian ended world number one Novak Djokovic's shot at history last month by stopping his bid for a calendar year Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows. Djokovic withdrew prior to the start of the tournament in Indian Wells, which was not held last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving Medvedev as its number one seed. In his last outing, Medvedev beat Denis Shapovalov in straight sets at the Laver Cup. Next up for Medvedev is Filip Krajinovic, who defeated Marcos Giron 7-6(2) 7-5 in the second round at the Masters 1000 tournament.

sports,Pirelli say Hamilton's tyre gamble likely would have failed," Oct 10 (Reuters) - Formula One tyre supplier Pirelli backed Mercedes on Sunday after Lewis Hamilton questioned his team's Turkish Grand Prix strategy and said he would have rather risked getting to the finish on a single set of intermediates. The seven-times world champion said he obeyed against his ""gut feeling"" when told to pit late in the race while in third place. He had decided to stay out when given an earlier instruction. The stop dropped Hamilton, who started 11th due to engine penalties, to fifth with Red Bull's Max Verstappen taking back the overall lead and going six points clear with six races remaining. Hamilton, winner of a record 100 races, responded angrily when he discovered he had lost two places in the pits. ""We shouldn't have come in, man. I told you,"" he said over the radio. ""My gut feeling was to stay out, and I feel like that's what I should have done. So I'm frustrated in myself for not following my gut,"" the Briton then told Sky Sports television. He had calmed down by the time he spoke to reporters. ""It was frustrating at the time. I could see second and all of a sudden I'm back in fifth,"" he said. ""I only have a certain amount of information and the team have other information. They see everyone else. For me it's hard to give something up when you don't fully know the whole picture. ""We win and lose as a team. I listened to the team today. Could we have stayed out? Who knows. If you look at a couple of other drivers who did, they dropped off massively and lost positions. So it was a risk either way. ""If I'd stayed out we don't know if I would have held position. But I'm a risk taker so I would have wanted to take that risk."" Alpine's Esteban Ocon finished 10th on the same set he started with, on a wet afternoon too slippery for regular slicks. Pirelli tyre boss Mario Isola doubted whether Hamilton would have been able to make the tyres last the full 58 laps and hold on to third place. ""Looking at the tyres after the race, I would say no or at least it was really at the limit,"" he said. ""It is a bit dangerous to push the boundaries like today but I fully understand that in race conditions they have to maximise the result."" Isola said most of the cars that stopped close to the end had tyres worn down to the carcass and that were ""completely finished"". ""I was suggesting to our engineers to warn the teams to change the tyres, not to go to the end because it was a risky move,"" he added.

The North Macedonians, who stunned Germany 2-1 in Duisburg in March, are desperate for a win to maintain their chances of advancing. ""I think the atmosphere in Skopje will be fiery. The (North Macedonian) team will be fully motivated. They want to protect their chances (of qualifying) and with their win in Germany they now have more confidence,"" Flick said. ""This team knows how to play football, they have skilled players in the squad. So we have to show our own qualities and that will be decisive."" ""I do not look back at the past,"" Flick said when asked about Germany's loss to North Macedonia, under his predecessor Joachim Loew.

sports,"Turkey win was one of my best, says Bottas"," ISTANBUL, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Valtteri Bottas hailed one of the best races of his Formula One career after ending a drought of more than a year with a dominant performance at the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday. The 32-year-old Mercedes driver, who is leaving for Alfa Romeo at the end of the season and may not have many chances  to win races again, said his first victory since September 2020 -- and 10th of his career -- tasted ""very sweet."" ""It's been a while, it feels good,"" he said after winning from pole with fastest lap. Bottas would normally be expected to play a supporting role to seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton but on Sunday he led from the front of the grid with his team mate starting only 11th after an engine penalty. Hamilton ended up fifth, losing his championship lead to Red Bull's Max Verstappen who now has a six-point advantage. Bottas said his win on a rain-affected afternoon was like ""night and day"" in comparison to last year's dismal outing in Turkey where he spun and dropped to the back on a slippery track. ""To some people, it could have looked easy, but it's far from that in these conditions,"" he told reporters. ""Everything went smoothly, I'm very glad, and the car really has been good in any condition this weekend. ""I had probably the worst race of my career last year and now one of the best.""

sports,LGBT+ fan groups alliance criticises Newcastle takeover," Oct 9 (Reuters) - Pride in Football, the alliance of LGBT+ supporters' groups in Britain, criticised Newcastle United's takeover by a Saudi Arabia-led consortium and called for reforms to the Premier League's owners' and directors' test. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) -- chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman -- now owns 80% of the club, with the rest divided between RB Sports & Media and PCP Capital Partners, whose chief executive, Amanda Staveley, led the takeover. Before the takeover was announced, Amnesty International had urged the Premier League to change its owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues and prevent ""sportswashing"". ""We have significant concerns, alongside human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, about the treatment of LGBT+ people in Saudi Arabia and other countries worldwide,"" Pride in Football said in a ""It is evident that the new ownership of Newcastle United have close links to, and in some cases are, the same people who lead the oppressive regime in Saudi Arabia. ""The footballing authorities have serious and significant questions to answer in allowing owners and sponsors to use football clubs as commodities to 'sports wash' and 'rainbow wash' their treatment of LGBT+ people, women and other minorities."" Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and Amnesty International questioned how the Premier League can go ahead with campaigns like ""Rainbow Laces"", an initiative it launched with LGBTQ+ rights group Stonewall to promote diversity and equality. On Friday, Newcastle United's official LGBTQ+ supporters' group said they were hopeful that the club's takeover could have a ""positive influence"" in the Saudi Arabia and improve conditions for LGBTQ+ people there. Staveley denied that the acquisition was designed to ""sportswash"" Saudi Arabia's human rights record, saying the deal would rebuild the club into a winning team. However, Pride in Football expressed solidarity with LGBT+ fans who would see the takeover as ""a sign of the continual broken commitments to the human rights in sport"". ""It is our fundamental belief that no fan should be in the situation that they have to decide between supporting the club they love and standing up for their rights or the rights of others,"" the statement continued. ""We directly called for a more thorough fit and proper test for owners and directors... This takeover highlights how inadequate the current tests and structures for football ownership are in this country -- they are simply not fit for purpose.""

Buster Posey hit a two-run home run in the first inning and Kris Bryant and Brandon Crawford added solo shots for the Giants, whose 107-win regular season earned them the home-field advantage in the best-of-five series against the 106-win Dodgers.

Tellez, who was on the injured list from Sept. 12-Oct. 1 with a right patellar strain, then drove a 1-2 pitch 411 feet to right-center. Pinch hitter Joc Pederson brought the Braves within 2-1 with an opposite-field homer to left with two outs in the eighth off Adrian Houser, who had retired the first five hitters he faced. Houser (1-0) got the victory after starter Corbin Burnes pitched six scoreless innings, allowing two hits and three walks while striking out six. --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Italy switching focus to game of the year against Swiss ??Mancini," TURIN, Italy, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Roberto Mancini is already focused on one of Italy?�s biggest games of the year against Switzerland next month, after the European champions returned to winning ways by beating Belgium in the UEFA Nations League on Sunday. The Azzurri?�s world record 37-match unbeaten run ended with a semi-final defeat by Spain, but goals from Nicolo Barella and Domenico Berardi sealed a 2-1 victory in the third-place playoff. ""They were two great games. Today we changed the players a bit, but despite that the team played just as well,"" Mancini told a news conference. The manager was quick to look ahead to his side?�s next challenge, a World Cup qualifier against the Swiss in Rome on Nov. 12, which may well decide who finishes top of Group C and earns an automatic qualifying spot. Switzerland, who lost 3-0 to Italy in the group stage of Euro 2020 before drawing 0-0 in last month's qualifier, will move level on 14 points with Mancini?�s side with two games remaining if they beat Lithuania on Tuesday. ""It will be a difficult match, like it was at the Euros and in Basel,"" Mancini said. ""We are playing at home, it will be the game of the year after the Euros matches. We know that we have to win."" Mancini, who made history by reaching his 30th win as Italy manager in only 44 matches, opted to use Manuel Locatelli as a deep-lying playmaker against Belgium, a role usually occupied by Jorginho, who missed his first Italy game since May.

sports,Cabrera Bello grabs lead as Rahm loses ground at Spanish Open," Oct 9 (Reuters) - Spain's Rafa Cabrera Bello surged into a two-shot lead with a faultless seven-under 64 as compatriot and world number one Jon Rahm slipped six shots off the pace after carding a one-over 72 in the third round of the Spanish Open on Saturday. Cabrera Bello, thrice a winner on the European tour, was in marvellous form as he made seven birdies in a bogey-free round that left him at 17-under for the tournament at the Club de Campo Villa de Madrid. Rahm, who attempting to become the first man since Seve Ballesteros in 1995 to win the Spanish Open three times, had a day to forget after he failed to recover from a terrible start. A bogey and double-bogey on the front nine were followed by bogeys on the 11th and 12th for the U.S. Open champion, who partially recovered with two successful birdie putts in his last five holes. Frenchman Julien Guerrier and Spaniard Adri Arnaus were tied for second at 15-under, with both making costly bogeys on the back nine that handed Cabrera Bello a two-shot advantage, while England's Richard Bland continued his fine season with a round of 64 that gave him a share of fifth place.

sports,Dramatic late winner keep alive Scotland?�s World Cup dreams," GLASGOW, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Scott McTominay headed home deep in stoppage time as Scotland twice came from behind to beat Israel 3-2 on Saturday and keep alive hopes of a first World Cup finals appearance since 1998. The dramatic conclusion to their qualifier at Hampden Park, and three-point haul, means Scotland consolidated second place in Group F as they moved to 14 points, four ahead of third placed Israel, with three matches each still to play. Denmark lead the group with a 100% record after six games. McTominay headed home John McGinn's corner after Israel had twice led through goals from Eran Zahavi and Munas Dabbur. McGinn and Lyndon Dykes replied for the hosts. Israel?�s goalkeeper Ofir Marciano made a penalty save from Dykes and two key stops to keep alive his own team?�s World Cup hopes before McTominay rose high to win the game for the Scots. Israel stunned the crowd at a wet Hampden as Zahavi stepped up off the turf after being fouled by Jack Hendry in the fifth minute and whipped the resultant free kick over the wall and beyond the reach of Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon. A sustained period of pressure from the home side led to McGinn?�s equaliser in the 29th minute as he curled a shot into the top corner from the edge of the area after being set up by some smart passing between Kieran Tierney and captain Andy Robertson. Parity, however, lasted all but two minutes as Israel struck from another free kick. The effort did appear to hit Dor Peretz on the arm before Dabbur tucked the ball away but, after a VAR check, the goal was allowed to stand. Scotland should have been level before halftime, however, when Billy Gilmour had his feet taken out from under him by Bibras Natcho as he attempted a shot from the edge of the box and a spotkick was awarded. However, Dykes' penalty was straight down the middle and easy for visiting goalie Marciano to save with his legs. Dykes did make up for the miss in the 57th minute to make the score 2-2 but it was only awarded after the Polish referee Szymon Marciniak went to the VAR monitor and overruled his own decision to initially disallow the attempt. Dykes had been penalised for a foot high challenge but replays showed he touched the ball before any contact with defender Ofri Arad, at the end of a perfect cross from Robertson. ""We know they're a difficult team, but in the second half we dominated them in my opinion on the pitch. We created a huge amount of chances,"" said goal hero McTominay. ""At halftime, we knew we had to wake up. They were more aggressive, more aware, more compact as a team in the first 45 (minutes).""

sports,WADA sanctions Russian anti-doping laboratory," MOSCOW, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said on Saturday it had revoked the status of a Moscow anti-doping laboratory because it failed to comply with ethical and laboratory standards. The National Anti-Doping Laboratory in Moscow had already been provisionally suspended in January 2020. WADA said the decision means the laboratory ""remains ineligible to carry out any work related to the analysis of blood samples in connection with the athlete biological passport (ABP) or any other form of anti-doping analysis..."" The laboratory has 21 days to appeal the decision at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA said. In 2016 WADA had authorised the laboratory to analyse athlete biological passports (ABP) to ensure the programme's continuity. However, its right to carry out other anti-doping activities remained revoked. ABP is designed to monitor different biological components that reveal doping over time. The laboratory's full accreditation was revoked in 2015 after a WADA-commissioned report found evidence of institutionalised doping in Russian athletics. Russia is banned from competing under its flag and with its national anthem at major international sporting events, including next year's Beijing Winter Olympics, as part of sanctions designed to punish Moscow for having provided WADA with doctored laboratory data. Russia has denied the existence of state-sponsored doping in the country but has at times acknowledged shortcomings in its enforcement of anti-doping regulations.

The 34-year-old, who started his professional career with Barca and is their record scorer with 672 goals, joined PSG on a two-year deal in the close season after being told by the Catalan club they could not afford to keep him. ""I came back to Barcelona (from the Copa America in July) to prepare for the season, after taking advantage of the extra days of vacation that the coach (Ronald Koeman) had given me,"" Messi told France Football in an interview released on Saturday. ""I had in mind to sign my contract and to start training right away. I thought that everything was settled and that all that was missing was my signature (on the contract). ""But when I arrived in Barcelona, I was told that it was no longer possible, that I could not stay and that I had to find another club, because Barca could not afford to extend my contract. That changed my plans. ""It was extremely hard to take. To think that we would have to leave our home and that the family would have to change its routine,"" added the the six-times Ballon d'Or winner. Messi, however, was reunited with Neymar at PSG, after he and the Brazilian played together for four seasons at Barcelona from 2013-17, and joined compatriots Leandro Paredes and Angel Di Maria and coach Mauricio Pochettino, also an Argentine. ""That was a big part of my decision because I knew I was coming to a new country and had to start from scratch. Knowing that I had friends in the dressing room made me think that things would be easier to adapt to,"" said Messi. ""And I was not wrong, because it was very easy to settle, especially because there are many players who speak Spanish, like me, and some friends like 'Ney', 'Lea' (Paredes), 'Fideo' (Di Maria), who helped me when I arrived."" After the ""very painful"" experience of leaving Barca, where Messi arrived at the age of 13, he is now aiming to win a fifth Champions League title. Messi forms, with Neymar and France striker Kylian Mbappe, one of the most formidable attacking lineups in the world, but he is aware they need to work on finding the perfect balance. While Neymar and Messi have known each other for years, the Argentine and France striker Mbappe still need to build a relationship. ""With a player like him, it's easy to get along. Also, Kylian speaks perfect Spanish, so we have good exchanges off the pitch as well,"" said Messi, who has so far scored one goal in five appearances in all competitions for PSG.

It's going to be very hard, from 11th, but not impossible ... so just staying on my toes and making sure that we deliver maximum attack tomorrow."" Hamilton has three other Red Bull drivers ahead of him on the grid, with Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez on the third row while Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda, from Red Bull's sister team AlphaTauri, are fourth and ninth. McLaren's Lando Norris, who lines up seventh, said he expected to stay ahead of Hamilton for only a couple of laps. ""I'm not going to say I'm going to beat him because I'm not,"" said the 21-year-old, who started on pole in Russia and nearly won. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff saw it differently, suggesting ""progress will be a tough one"" with all the cars ahead of Hamilton starting on the same medium tyres except for Tsunoda on the softs. ""Yesterday in the long run at a certain stage we were behind a Haas and also Williams and it was very difficult to even come close. So I guess strategy is more going to be the one that helps tomorrow,"" he said. The qualifying times, however, highlighted Mercedes' performance advantage with Hamilton more than a second quicker than Norris, and eight tenths faster than Perez. Hamilton said he would just take it one step at a time, and had to get through the opening lap safely first from his midfield position. ""If I can be higher up early on, then great.

sports,'I'm 300% with Spain' - Laporte ready to face country of birth France," Oct 9 (Reuters) - The grand finale to what has been an enthralling Nations League Final Four tournament will be a memorable occasion for the players of France and Spain but will be particularly special for Manchester City defender Aymeric Laporte. Laporte played over 50 times for France's youth teams, captaining Les Bleus at under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 level. He was then called into three senior squads, but never made an appearance under coach Didier Deschamps. The solution to his lack of international action was a drastic one to say the least but, after becoming a Spanish citizen in May, the switch of allegiance has paid off. The 27-year-old Manchester City defender's 12th international in that short time is set to be against the country of his birth on Sunday in Milan as Spain look to become Nations League champions - an event he is more than ready for. ""It will be a very special meeting for me but, as I have always said, I am very focused. I am 100% or even 300% with Spain,"" Laporte told Spain's official Twitter account. ""I'll give it my all. I will face former team mates (from France's youth teams) but the only thing I think about is winning this final, that's the most important thing for me right now."" The centre back grew up in south-west France but moved to Spain in 2010 to join the Athletic Bilbao youth academy. Deschamps said on Saturday that he had not spoken to Laporte since he made his decision to switch allegiances. ""I didn?�t speak with him again. He had this opportunity and I am happy for him. He was with us, now he is with them, it is his choice and I respect it,"" Deschamps said. ""It was the path he wanted to take and I hope it goes well for him, even if tomorrow our path will cross,"" he added. The decision to switch country, which players can do as long as they have not featured in more than three matches for that nation before the age of 21 and have not played at a World Cup or continental tournament, was not straightforward. HUGE CONTRIBUTION In 2016, Laporte said, while on international duty with France, he had the chance to become a Spanish citizen but elected to stay with Les Bleus in pursuit of a first cap. His full international bow remained elusive though as Laporte got injured when named in the France squad for the Euro 2020 qualification fixtures against Albania and Andorra, before Spain coach Luis Enrique's interest was piqued. ""As soon as Aymeric was able to play for us he began to make a huge contribution,"" Luis Enrique said in July. ""He is a top player in both the attacking and defensive phases. ""He is an excellent defender and we are all delighted that he has decided to play for Spain."" The relationship with Deschamps was not quite so positive, with both sides accusing each other of lying over whether Laporte sent the France coach a message to inform him of the allegiance switch. That is all water under the bridge now, with Laporte, who has won his place back in the City side this season with a string of impressive performances, a key part of an exciting, young Spanish side. Spain shocked many by ending Italy's world record 37-game unbeaten run en route to the Nations League final and, after falling at the semi-final stage to the Italians in Euro 2020, Laporte is aiming to go all the way this time around. ""It was very important to take our revenge on Italy after what happened at the European Championship,"" he added. ""Beating Italy gives us confidence to come home with a gold medal around our neck.""

sports,Premier League clubs demand emergency meeting over Newcastle takeover," Oct 9 (Reuters) - Premier League clubs have reached out to the league with complaints about Newcastle United's takeover by a Saudi Arabia-led consortium and are pushing for an emergency meeting next week, the The Premier League announced on Thursday that Newcastle had been sold to a group consisting of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media. The investment group had previously made public a 305 million pound ($415 million) bid to buy the club in April 2020. That deal collapsed three months later amid scrutiny from the league, which came under pressure to stop the sale due to concerns over alleged broadcast piracy in Saudi Arabia. The piracy dispute involved Qatari-owned beIN Sports, the league's broadcast rights holder across the Middle East, which had been barred from operating in Saudi Arabia. That ban was lifted on Wednesday, clearing a major hurdle to the takeover. The Guardian said the 19 Premier League clubs are understood to be united in opposition to a Saudi-led consortium being allowed to buy out former owner Mike Ashley. The clubs have also raised concerns that the league's brand ""could be damaged"" by Saudi Arabia's PIF - chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman - taking an 80% stake in Newcastle, the report added. On Thursday, Amnesty International urged the Premier League to change its owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues. Human rights groups have condemned Saudi Arabia's efforts to ""sportswash"" its human rights record but the kingdom's government denies allegations of human rights abuses and says it is protecting national security from extremists and external actors.

sports,Hamilton qualifies quickest but Bottas takes pole," ISTANBUL, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton qualified quickest for the Turkish Grand Prix on Saturday but a 10-place grid penalty for the Formula One championship leader meant Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas took pole position. Hamilton's title rival Max Verstappen, two points behind the Briton with seven races remaining, qualified third for Red Bull and will join Bottas on the front row at Istanbul Park on Sunday. The pole was a first since Portugal in May for Bottas, and the 18th of his career, but Hamilton was fastest in every phase of qualifying after taking the hit for a new engine that exceeded his season's allocation. ""Tomorrow is going to be difficult but I'll give it everything,"" said Britain's seven times world champion Hamilton of the task ahead. ""We've got the long straight down the back, we'll see what we can do. Hopefully we can give the fans here a good race."" Verstappen took a grid penalty at the previous race in Russia and finished second after starting at the back of the field, his progress helped after late rain caused problems for others. Mercedes will be looking to Bottas, who is leaving the team for Alfa Romeo at the end of the season, to keep Verstappen behind him while Hamilton sets about fighting through from 11th. ""I'll focus on my own race tomorrow, that's the way to go when you start in front, and try to keep up a good pace,"" said the Finn. Verstappen struggled with the setup in Friday practice, with the track far grippier than last year's slippery surface, but said the team had made ""a decent recovery. ""Tomorrow, lining up in second, let's wait and see what the weather will do, but overall I'm pretty happy,"" said the Dutch 24-year-old. ""Let's see how competitive we will be in the race. The tyre wear seems quite high around the track, but it's quite fun to drive."" Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will share the second row with AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, who will be expected by Red Bull to make life difficult for Hamilton as a driver for their sister team. Double world champion Fernando Alonso, for Alpine, and Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez line up together on row three and will also be hard to get past. McLaren's Lando Norris, on pole in Russia and leading until the final laps, was eighth fastest and starts seventh with Lance Stroll alongside for Aston Martin. Hamilton will also have to get past AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda and four times world champion Sebastian Vettel's Aston Martin.

McLaren's Australian Daniel Ricciardo, winner of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, qualified 16th with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz keeping him out of the second phase right at the end. Sainz, who starts at the back of the grid due to an engine change, also gave team mate Leclerc a useful aerodynamic tow to help the Monegasque into the final phase.

""We have rejuvenated myself, reinvented myself. Redemption is upon us, and I can't wait to show the world what I'm all about.""

Rupp, who in 2017 became the first American-born male to win the Chicago Marathon in 35 years, placed eighth at the Olympics where some major names dropped out amid humid conditions but said his coach Mike Smith has him ready for Sunday. ""I've actually recovered great,"" Rupp, 35, told reporters. ""Obviously we knew it was going to be a quick turnaround coming here so soon after the Olympics, but it's always nice when it's something that you've been planning for. ""I knew I was going to come here well in advance before the Olympics and I think Mike and I sat down and before we committed, (we) really talked about what are the pros and cons of doing this."" Rupp last competed in the Chicago Marathon in 2019 where, after recovering from Achilles surgery and in his first race of any distance in a year, he dropped out just before the 23-mile mark with calf strain. After Tokyo, Rupp said Smith wanted him to take a short break from intense workouts so he could reset, clear his mind and spend time at home with family before resuming training. ""I took a week pretty easy right after the Olympics, didn't do any workouts, just ran super slow. Mike literally said 'think about your grandma running with you,'"" said Rupp, who won a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. ""It's just about moving your legs and getting out there and that's going to help flush out a lot of junk that comes from running a marathon."" After the second week, Rupp was nearly fully recovered and so increased his volume and added moderate workouts to the mix. In the third week post-Olympics he picked up the intensity and has been hitting it hard ever since. Rupp now hopes a return to a course where he has enjoyed success will help him to put the disappointment of his Tokyo Olympics result behind him. ""I would say the last six weeks have been better than really anything I did before the Olympics,"" said Rupp. ""You're never sure how it's going to go coming off of a marathon like that but it's actually been a really good build-up for Chicago here.

""It was my decision having talked with my agent, coaches, [general managers] and owners,"" Manning said on the ""10 Questions with Kyle Brandt"" podcast, which was posted Thursday. ""Going through the draft process, I was just worried about the Chargers organization at the time. I felt it was the right decision and I had a little pull. I quietly tried to say. ?�Hey, please don't draft me, it can be our secret,' and they didn't keep the secret part of it real well."" At the time, the Chargers hadn't had a winning season in 10 years and were 1-15 in 2000 - the same season the Giants lost Super Bowl XXXV to the Baltimore Ravens. The Chargers took Manning No. 1, then traded him within an hour to the New York Giants for No. 4 overall draft pick Philip Rivers and three future draft picks. Taken between them were Robert Gallery at No. 2 to the Oakland Raiders, who turned out to be a bust, and future Hall of Fame wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. Many people long have speculated that Manning's father, Archie, was behind the play to keep Eli out of San Diego. Eli said that wasn't true. ""My dad just tried to take some heat off of me,"" Manning said. ""He knew I'd get criticized, he didn't love the idea of it at first just because it was going to cause a lot of drama."" The trade worked out for both teams. Both Manning and Rivers are the all-time leading passers for their teams. Manning threw for 57,023 yards, Rivers for 63,440 yards in 16 seasons with the Chargers and one with the Indianapolis Colts. Rivers is fifth all-time in passing yards and Manning is eighth.

sports,"Indonesia, Thailand want WADA to reconsider non-compliant ruling"," Oct 8 (Reuters) - Indonesia and Thailand will ask the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to reconsider its decision to declare them non-compliant, representatives of the two countries said on Friday. WADA announced on Thursday that the National Anti-Doping Agencies (NADOs) of North Korea and Indonesia were ruled to be non-compliant for not implementing effective testing programs. Thailand was declared non-compliant after failing to fully implement the 2021 Anti-Doping Code, WADA added. Indonesia's sports minister Zainudin Amali told reporters that the country wrote to WADA on Friday explaining that the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented it from extracting enough samples from athletes and sending them to WADA. The pandemic resulted in most sports events around the world being cancelled or postponed last year. ""This caused the sample requirement to not be fulfilled,"" Amali said, adding that Indonesia's government hoped to send WADA 'ample' samples from a nationwide sports event being held in the easternmost Papua province. A spokesman for Indonesia's badminton association said three tournaments in Bali -- the Indonesia Masters, Indonesia Open, and BWF World Tour Finals -- would proceed as planned in November and December despite the WADA sanction. The declaration of non-compliance means the three countries are ineligible to be awarded the right to host regional, continental or world championships during their suspension. Representatives of the countries are also ineligible to sit as members of the boards on committees until their nations are reinstated or for a period of one year, whichever is longer. The Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT) said they would petition WADA next week to reconsider the non-compliance ruling. Thailand has finished amending the text of its anti-doping regulations to be in compliance with WADA's 2021 Anti-Doping Code, but the document has not been published for enactment due to internal legal processes, SAT Governor Gongsak Yodmani said. ""We will explain to WADA that we weren't ignoring the problem. We will proceed with enacting the law as soon as possible,"" Gongsak added. The law could be published as a decree instead to speed up enactment and it will be in effect before the Beijing Winter Olympics in February, he said.

sports,U.S. charges 18 former NBA players with defrauding league's health plan," NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Eighteen former National Basketball Association players were charged on Thursday with defrauding the league's health and welfare benefit plan out of $3.9 million by seeking reimbursement for medical and dental work that was never performed. According to an indictment filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, players received $2.5 million in fraudulent proceeds, with 10 paying the alleged ringleader, Terrence Williams, at least $230,000 in kickbacks. Prosecutors said Williams offered false invoices in exchange for the kickbacks and helped obtain bogus ""letters of medical necessity"" for three players. ""The defendants' playbook involved fraud and deception,"" U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Audrey Strauss said at a press conference. Among the defendants are Tony Allen, a six-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team, and Glen Davis, both of whom won a championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008. Other defendants include Sebastian Telfair, a former Brooklyn high school basketball star, and Milt Palacio, now an assistant coach for the Portland Trail Blazers. Williams played for the New Jersey Nets and three other teams from 2009 to 2013. Lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be identified. The Trail Blazers said Palacio, who was added to the team's coaching staff in early August, was put on administrative leave pending further notice. ""The federal investigation is independent of the Trail Blazers organization and we will have no further comment pending the outcome of the legal process,"" the team said in a statement. In a statement, the NBA said it will cooperate with prosecutors, calling the accusations ""particularly disheartening"" given the importance of its benefit plans to support players' health, including after they retire. The alleged scheme involved two dental offices and a chiropractic office in the Los Angeles area, and a wellness office in Washington state. Prosecutors said some invoices showed Allen, Davis and the defendant Tony Wroten receiving crowns on the same six teeth on the same day, and Davis receiving crowns on eight teeth in Beverly Hills when he was actually in Nevada. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit health care and wire fraud. Williams was also charged with identity theft for posing as a plan manager questioning a reimbursement to ""frighten"" Chris Douglas-Roberts, a defendant who had not paid a kickback, into re-engaging with him. Other defendants include Alan Anderson, Shannon Brown, Will Bynum, Melvin Ely, Jamario Moon, Darius Miles, Ruben Patterson, Eddie Robinson, Greg Smith, C.J. Watson and Antoine Wright.

The 18-year-old British sensation had an aura of invincibility at Flushing Meadows, where as a tournament qualifier she did not drop a set in 10 matches en route to her stunning maiden Grand Slam title. But it was a different story under the lights on the stadium court as Raducanu struggled with her accuracy and energy level. Unforced errors piled up as the night wore on and she never exuded the on-court joy that was a hallmark of her breakthrough despite a supportive crowd. After the match, she tipped her hat to the unseeded Belarusian. ""Aliaksandra played a great match,"" the 17th seed said. ""She's an extremely experienced opponent who has been on the Tour for many years. She was better than me today so she deserves to win."" The match started promisingly enough for Raducanu when she held serve at love to kick off the affair in the Southern California desert. But errors began to creep in and a locked-in Sasnovich took full advantage, floating a lob over Raducanu's outstretched racket to claim the first set. Raducanu was broken to begin the second set but battled back to take a 4-2 lead when Sasnovich began to misfire.

sports,Japanese octogenarian skateboarder learns new tricks," OSAKA, Japan, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Yoshio Kinoshita is living proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks. The 81-year-old rides the ramps at his local skate park in the city of Osaka almost every morning, picking up tips from skateboarders decades younger than him. ""They are all my teachers,"" said Kinoshita, who worked as a technician in the construction industry before retiring and still works part time as an attendant in a bicyle parking lot. ""At first I was holding on to the railing"" he said, before he progressed to mastering a 180 degree turn and other tricks. Kinoshita picked up skateboarding just two years ago, when he bought a board he saw at a market selling unclaimed goods left on the railway. The 800 yen ($7.15) skateboard was a spur of the moment purchase that changed the Japanese octagenarian's life. In a country that has the most aged society in the world, with more than 35% of its population expected to be 65 and over by 2050, Kinoshita recommended skateboarding as a way to prevent dementia. ""It's a sport with a sense of tension,"" he said. ""Rather than zoning out, I think skateboarding improves the ability to think even just by a little bit."" ""For (old) people like me who try to learn new things, if we don't practice it little by little every day we will forget how to do it immediately,"" he said. ""That's why I think I have to (come here) and practice every day."" Kinoshita, who has two children and two grandchildren, said he watched skateboarders at the recent Tokyo Olympics in awe. All three medallists in the women's street skateboarding competition at the Games were in their teens, including the country's own ""They are really incredible,"" said Kinoshita. ""To be honest, I can't beat those 5-year-old, 4-year-old or 3-year-old kids. That's for sure.""

sports,Hamilton to take grid drop in Turkey after engine change," ISTANBUL, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Seven-times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton will take a 10-place grid penalty for the Turkish Grand Prix after Mercedes changed the engine on his car on Friday amid reliability concerns. The new internal combustion engine (ICE) exceeds the Briton's allocation of three for the season, triggering the penalty. Hamilton is two points clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen with seven races to go, including Sunday's at the Istanbul Park circuit, and any mechanical failure in a race would be a big blow. Verstappen took a penalty at the previous rain-hit race in Russia, starting last but still finishing second to limit the damage. Hamilton won in Turkey last year, clinching his record-equalling seventh championship. He had played down the need for an engine change on Thursday. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz has taken an entire new power unit as part of a planned upgrade and will start from the back of the grid. Mercedes' head of trackside engineering Andrew Shovlin told Sky Sports television that the team had simulated all the races to the end of the year before deciding Turkey was the best option. Hamilton famously went from 19th to second at the Istanbul circuit in a GP2 race in 2006, the year before his Formula One debut with McLaren. ""This is a circuit, you remember Lewis and that GP2 race, where he felt there's a lot of opportunity and it should make for an exciting Sunday,"" said Shovlin. Hamilton would have gone to the back of the grid had Mercedes changed all the elements in the power unit but Shovlin said changing the engine covered most of the risk and anything more was 'a lot of fairly intrusive work'. ""Obviously the thing that you definitely don?�t want to do is fail during a race and then have to take a penalty anyway,"" he said. ""And then there?�s also a performance element, because the power units do lose a bit of horsepower over their life. ""The bit that most contributes to that reliability element and the performance is the ICE itself and it?�s better to take 10 places than start from the back."" Hamilton lapped fastest in first practice, four tenths of a second quicker than Verstappen.

sports,Human rights groups criticise Newcastle sale to Saudi-led consortium," Oct 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian human rights group ALQST accused the Premier League of being driven only by money and employing 'profoundly inadequate' criteria for assessing human rights considerations in the wake of Newcastle United being acquired by a Saudi-led consortium. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) -- chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman -- now owns 80% of the club, with the rest divided between RB Sports & Media and PCP Capital Partners, whose chief executive, Amanda Staveley, While fans are hopeful that the takeover will help turn the Premier League club's fortunes around, several human rights groups have questioned the Premier League for allowing the move to go through, pointing to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record. ""For Saudi Arabia, the deal shows the success of their PR strategy to invest in sporting ventures in a bid to clean up their image. For the Premier League... they are effectively inviting other abusive leaders to follow suit,"" ALQST acting director Nabhan al-Hanashi told Reuters. ""Their (Premier League) reasoning that PIF is a separate entity from the Saudi state is farcical -- one only has to look at who chairs the PIF -- Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman himself, whose rule has been marked by the most brutal forms of repression."" Omid Memarian, director of communications at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), told Reuters: ""The purpose of this investment is to infiltrate in areas where people invest a lot of emotions... people want to cheer for teams owned by responsible owners and not those who are involved in atrocities."" DAWN was founded by Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was allegedly murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, with a U.S. report saying that the prince had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi. ""People should know that the government investing in this club has murdered a journalist and not been held accountable for that,"" added Memarian. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and dismissed the report's findings. Human Rights Watch described the takeover as a wake-up call for fans, broadcasters and players. ""This is against the backdrop of a strategy by Saudi Arabia to use sports teams, athletes and major sporting events in the country to distract from its national human rights crises,"" said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. The Premier League and PIF did not immediately respond to requests for a comment. Saudi Arabia's government denies allegations of human rights abuses and says it is protecting itself from extremists and external factors, while the Premier League said on Thursday that it green-lighted the move after receiving ""legally-binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club"". In an interview to The Times on Thursday, Staveley rejected suggestions of ""sportwashing"", saying had that been the case, they would have bought a major franchise in the U.S. and not a club sitting in the relegation zone in the Premier League. ""... This is about business investment and doing something special with a fantastic football club with the best fans in the world,"" she said.

sports,"Staveley promises Newcastle overhaul, knocks back sportswashing critics"," LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - British businesswoman Amanda Staveley on Friday denied that a Saudi-backed takeover of Premier League club Newcastle United was designed to ""sportswash"" Saudi Arabia's human rights record, saying the deal would rebuild the club into a winning team. Staveley's PCP Capital Partners group fronted a consortium 80%-led by Saudi Arabia's PIF sovereign wealth fund that on Thursday secured the club in a 305 million pound ($415.5 million) deal to the delight of fans who had accused former owner Mike Ashley of under-investment. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and human rights groups, such as Amnesty UK, have accused the oil-rich nation of ""sportwashing their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football"". But Staveley said the $430 billion PIF was an autonomous, commercially-driven fund that had paid a reasonable price for a club in which it planned to invest for the long term. Key decisions will be made by the new board of PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Staveley and Jamie Reuben, the son of billionaire property investor David Reuben - although Staveley said the executive team could be strengthened in future. ""We are buying a club that could be relegated next week,"" she told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""If we were thinking about this as being some type of sportswashing exercise we would have made different choices."" Newcastle are currently second from bottom in the Premier League standings after a disappointing start to the season under manager Steve Bruce. Staveley said she had been texting former striking great Alan Shearer and former Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan, both revered on Tyneside, and hopes to offer them as-yet unspecified roles. She'll start by seeking to move Shearer's statue to its ""rightful place"" inside the St James' Park grounds, she said. It currently stands outside of the stadium. ""We are really excited about working with him because he's just a legend,"" she said after returning to London from Newcastle by train where, she added, she had been ""cuddled"" and photographed by fans delighted at a change in ownership that will make the club one of the richest in the world. She now wants not only to secure new players, but ensure there are great managers, training staff, medics and physiotherapists and a beefed up academy and scouting network to attract young talent. ""Of course I want to win the Premier League,"" she said. ""At some point, of course, we want trophies. The last time the club won a trophy was 1955.

sports,Pepi double gives US win over Jamaica," Oct 7 (Reuters) - A second-half double from Ricardo Pepi gave the United States a 2-0 home win over Jamaica on Thursday to remain unbeaten in CONCACAF qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. After opening the group with two draws the United States have now won two in a row, with 18-year-old Pepi becoming the youngest American to score in consecutive World Cup qualifiers. The victory earned the United States a share of top spot on eight points with Mexico, who drew 1-1 with Canada at the Azteca Stadium in an ill-tempered contest that was halted briefly in the second half when spectators began chanting homophobic slurs. The top three in the eight-team group qualify automatically for Qatar 2022 with the fourth-placed finisher going into an intercontinental playoff for another spot. Pepi put the United States ahead in the 49th minute in Austin, Texas, when he headed home a superb cross from Sergino Dest. He added a second 13 minutes later, charging onto a cross from Brendan Aaronson and stabbing it past a diving Andre Blake for his third goal in two national team appearances. Hosts Mexico opened the scoring in the 21st minute with Jorge Sanchez taking advantage of a breakdown in the Canada defence. Jonathan Osorio netted the equaliser in the 42nd minute, running onto a ball from Alphonso Davies and clinically tucking it past keeper Guillermo Ochoa to give Canada their first goal against Mexico at the Azteca since 1980. ""The positives, we take a point in a hard place and we keep going,"" said Osorio. ""It's a big goal for me and for Canada, it is just another step in the right direction but we know we still got a lot of work to do."" Mexico were booed off the pitch after a half dominated by Canada with Davies missing from close range and a Steven Vitoria header flying just past the far post. Things turned nasty in the second half with Tecatito Corona and Richie Laryea getting into an exchange that produced yellow cards, which was soon followed by homophobic chants that resulted in the match being stopped and a warning issued in the stadium. In other qualifiers, Honduras and Costa Rica laboured to a 0-0 draw in San Pedro Sula while El Salvador took all three points in a 1-0 win over Panama on a first-half goal from Enrico Duenas. Canada are on six points, two behind the joint leaders, while El Salvador and Panama are on five points. Costa Rica and Honduras have three points and Jamaica prop up the group on one.

Newcastle were bought by a group comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media, ending years of uncertainty to the delight of fans. Ashley, the owner of a sportswear chain alongside other businesses, had long ceased to be a fan favourite over what most saw as a lack of investment. The club were relegated twice during his 14 years in charge before immediately bouncing back. ""I would like it to be known that I received a higher offer for the club than the one that I accepted. It was from another reputable bidder who made a credible case,"" Ashley told the Sun newspaper in an ""But I felt the bid that we accepted from the current new owners would deliver the best for Newcastle United. Money wasn't my only consideration. There were times when I stepped in financially to keep Newcastle United afloat. ""We ensured the wage bills were paid when we went down in order that we could bounce straight back up. Nobody was happier than me when we achieved immediate promotion."" Ashley said he was not in the same ""financial league"" as the consortium, and selling had been the best option. ""It's hard to compete at the highest level in football with certain clubs that have almost unlimited resources,"" he said.

Receiving texts from players he grew up worshiping and being front page news around the world -- especially in his native Russia -- was a thrill, he said. But there is one element of his newfound fame that has left him baffled.

The world number two received $2.5 million for winning the U.S. Open and has amassed nearly $20 million in prize money over his career, so it is safe to say he can afford to pay for his own meals.

Sally Bolton, who last year became the AELTC's first female CEO after a career that has also encompassed rugby league, rugby union and athletics, found herself as a panelist at the Leaders Week sport business conference justifying Wimbledon's famed reluctance to speak about any issue beyond Wimbledon. ""We spend a lot of time not having a view on things,"" Bolton told an audience of business leaders at Twickenham Stadium. ""On pretty much any issue we are getting a phone call asking what's Wimbledon's position on it. The reality is we don't have a position on most things because it's not for us to comment and you have to be very careful. ""We do often talk about issues and consider whether Wimbledon should be more forthright,"" she added. ""Wimbledon is still often described as the 'highly secretive All England Club'. In a way for a reason as we (previously) literally never commented on anything. ""To a large extent people don't know who the CEO is - and that's a good thing. I don't want to be the story."" Other than its annual announcement of prize money, a routine promise to invest profits in the development of British tennis, the ticket ballot and bright pieces of news about how many strawberries have been sold, Wimbledon is usually tight-lipped. ""The issue you have to be mindful of is when Wimbledon has a view on something it grabs a headline and that's a precious thing to protect because it means you can influence things,"" Bolton said. ""Around environmental sustainability we want to use our voice to influence but we also have to be mindful that people want our voice in lots of debates and we have to pick and choose which ones we want to be in."" Bolton shared the stage with BBC Director-General Tim Davie, who asked Bolton about the mystery and aura surrounding Wimbledon. ""There is a live debate because when you have an event like The Championships there is a lot of mystique about it,"" she said. ""If people could see the ugliness of the scramble to put an event on, its not pretty, the mystique ... it should look like it should happen by magic."" Davie's subsequent suggestion that the Championships could become the next subject for the sort of behind the scenes TV shows that shone a light on the likes of Manchester City and the Australia cricket team was dismissed by Bolton. Then, after listening to Davie explain that increasing transparency was one of his driving forces at the BBC, Bolton left the stage and declined to speak to reporters at the event.

She felt she had to do something and a bar of chocolate helped her reach a decision. A local NGO was offering chocolate to anyone who wanted to try out boxing and Da Silva went along. She loved it. She gained a new passion and a new moniker. If she ever makes it in the ring her friends joke her nickname will be ?�Twix?? Da Silva is part of a fledgling boxing programme in Capao Redondo, a favela on Sao Paulo?�s gritty south side. The project has been helped by a surge of interest in the sport after the summer Olympics, where Brazil won three boxing medals, their biggest haul at a single Games. ?�I imagine having a gold medal around my neck in that gigantic ring and my mum being proud of me and me being happy at winning,??Da Silva said of her boxing dreams. The programme is run by an NGO called NAVE. NAVE was formed in 2014 to provide educational and cultural programmes, but indoor activities were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sport continued outdoors and NAVE added boxing to its roster of activities in June this year, believing it teaches children how to channel their aggression. ?�Letting them punch in a controlled environment like boxing is an escape valve for them,??Bruno Hereira dos Santos, NAVE?�s founder and president, told Reuters. ?�They don?�t have a lot of options so even the girls enjoy it."" Da Silva is the first to don gloves when the sparring begins alongside a dirt football pitch near the summit of the hillside community.

sports,Saudi Arabia-led consortium completes Newcastle takeover," LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - A Saudi-Arabian backed consortium completed its purchase of Premier League club Newcastle United on Thursday as a long-running takeover saga finally reached the conclusion the majority of the club's supporters desired. Fourteen months after Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) withdrew a 305 million pounds ($415.07 million) bid to buy the north-east club from owner Mike Ashley following the Premier League's failure to give regulatory approval, a deal was announced after a day of mounting excitement on Tyneside. After the Premier League confirmed the struggling club had been sold to a consortium consisting of PIF, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media with immediate effect, fans began celebrating outside the St James' Park stadium. A statement from Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of PIF who will become non-executive chairman of Newcastle United, said the deal would mean long-term investment to ""harness the club's potential and build upon the club's legacy. ""We are extremely proud to become the new owners of Newcastle United, one of the most famous clubs in English football. We thank the Newcastle fans for their tremendously loyal support over the years and we are excited to work together with them,"" he said. The takeover, fronted by PCP Capital Partners' chief executive Amanda Staveley, ends an unhappy era at St James' Park and means Newcastle will be one of the world's richest clubs. Staveley will have a seat on Newcastle's board of directors along with Jamie Reuben of RB Sports & Media. ""This is a long-term investment,"" Staveley said in a statement. ""Our ambition is aligned with the fans - to create a consistently successful team that's regularly competing for major trophies and generates pride across the globe."" RAPID DEVELOPMENTS A rapid sequence of events reignited the deal after Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports, a Premier League rights holder, said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia would lift a ban on it and also shut down illegal streaming services, removing a major obstacle behind the collapsed takeover. Another stumbling block was overcome after the Premier League, who came under pressure to block the deal last year, received ""legally binding"" assurances that there was clear separation between PIF and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, despite PIF being chaired by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. ""All parties are pleased to have concluded this process which gives certainty and clarity to Newcastle United Football Club and their fans,"" the Premier League said. The fate of Newcastle coach Steve Bruce will be high on the agenda of the new owners, who are keen to invest in the club. ""I know everybody has a lot of questions about managers and players and things but right now we just want to get there and do a review of the business. We're going to let you all know the plans,"" Staveley told reporters after the deal was announced. Hundreds of Newcastle's so-called Toon Army supporters, who have protested against Ashley's running of the club, gathered outside the stadium in the drizzle throughout the day, buoyed by news of the imminent takeover. While they were celebrating, others said it was another example of Saudi Arabia ""sportswashing"". SPORTS ASSETS PIF -- Saudi Arabia's $430 billion sovereign wealth fund -- is at the centre of plans to transform the economy by creating new sectors and diversifying revenues away from oil. The country has increasingly sought high-profile sports assets, including signing a 10-year deal to stage F1 and hosting Anthony Joshua's heavyweight title fight in 2019. Having a club with Newcastle's potential in its locker is a major scoop for the oil-rich nation. But Amnesty UK chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh said earlier on Thursday that the Saudi authorities were ""sportwashing their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football. ""Instead of allowing those implicated in serious human rights violations to walk into English football simply because they have deep pockets, we've urged the Premier League to change their owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues,"" he added. Saudi Arabia's government denies allegations of human rights abuses and says it is protecting national security from extremists and external actors. Newcastle become the 14th current Premier League club to have majority foreign owners and fans hope it heralds a new era like that at Manchester City who have dominated English football since being bought by Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour in 2008. French club Paris St-Germain have also made an impact under Qatari ownership with a host of mega-money signings. Newcastle's takeover ends the 14-year ownership of Ashley whose stewardship has been deeply unpopular, with the supporters accusing him of under-investment and lack of ambition. Since Ashley bought the sleeping giants, who last won a domestic trophy in 1955 and have not been top-flight champions since 1927, they have twice been relegated from the Premier League and have not finished higher than 10th since 2012. Another relegation battle is looming with the team failing to win any of their opening seven league games and currently sitting second from bottom of the table and fans have been calling for Ashley and manager Bruce to leave the club.

""In terms of competition, we'll have liquidity providers, market makers, compete for business, which means better prices and better odds, and lowers friction, and also means there's more data for you to look at when you're placing a wager,"" he said. Hudson River Trading and Tower Research, proprietary trading firms that make markets in various asset classes by providing two-sided quotes for others to trade against, have also invested in Sporttrade. Cohen also said it would make sense for brokerages like Robinhood to enter event and prediction markets. ""That same customer segment that's looking to buy Apple, maybe buy bitcoin, is also interested in Sunday football and so I think that's going to be a natural evolution,"" he said. Sports betting will grow with or without Nasdaq, and the exchange operator is well-positioned to provide advanced technology and potentially make the market safer and more transparent, Cohen said. ""What we're going to have to think about as a country is just based on investor protection and making sure we're not raising a culture of bettors,"" he said.

sports,'No more silence': NWSL players return to the field," NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Banners and signs declaring ""PROTECT THE PLAYERS"" and ""NO MORE SILENCE"" ringed National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) pitches on Wednesday as teams took to the field for the first time since sexual misconduct allegations rocked the competition. The matches were the first since a report from The Athletic said Riley has denied ""the majority"" of the allegations in its report. Attempts by Reuters to reach Riley for comment were unsuccessful. Play was halted six minutes into Washington Spirit's game against NJ/NY Gotham FC at Suburu Park in suburban Philadelphia on Wednesday as both squads linked arms at the centre circle. The NWSL Players Association said the gesture was in recognition of the six years since former players Mana Shim and Sinead Farrelly came forward with allegations, ""and all those who fought for too long to be heard"". Players stood in silence for a minute. ""During that time, we ask you to stand in that pain and discomfort with us,"" the statement read. The NWSLPA also outlined demands for the league, including that ""every coach, general manager, representative on the board of governors and owner"" submit to an independent investigation into abusive conduct. In Cary, North Carolina, where Riley led the Courage to a second consecutive NWSL title in 2019, the home team and visiting Racing Louisville delivered the same gesture. Riley has been fired by the Courage and the league. The allegations also led to the ouster of Commissioner Lisa Baird and prompted investigations by the NWSL, U.S. Soccer and FIFA. An hour before the Portland Thorns kicked off their home match against Houston Dash the club announced general manager Gavin Wilkinson had been placed on administrative leave. The Thorns had previously apologised for not being more transparent after receiving a complaint against then-coach Riley in 2015. As the Thorns and Dash linked arms inside Providence Park, a fan was seen holding a sign reading: ""Six years."" Wednesday's game between Spirit and Gotham, which ended 0-0, was supposed to have been an occasion to honour two-time World Cup winner Carli Lloyd, who is set to retire. ""It's been emotional week -- we've had a lot to celebrate, a lot to reflect on,"" the NJ/NY forward said after the game. Courage beat Louisville 3-1 in North Carolina while Thorns were beaten 3-2 by Dashwith English player Rachel Dalyscoring two goals, including the 79th-minute winner.

sports,Clijsters comes up short at Indian Wells but aims to battle on," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Former world number one Kim Clijsters said she knew her return to tennis was never going to be a smooth ride after the Belgian's opening round defeat to Katarina Siniakova at Indian Wells dropped her to 0-5 since coming back to the tour. The 38-year-old, who retired for a second time in 2012 but returned to action in February last year, went down 6-1 2-6 6-2 to the Czech. Clijsters had knee surgery in October last year and returned to the court at last week's Chicago Fall Tennis Classic, where she lost in the first round to Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei. ""Last week in Chicago I started off well but had a few games where I really wasn't into the match,"" Clijsters told reporters. ""Here too, looking for my rhythm, my anticipation again, reading my opponents, getting used to playing on a bigger court again. ""I fought my way into the match well in that second set, and I kind of put her under pressure a little bit better. Overall, there's definitely moments where I'm feeling really good out there, and there?�s moments where I feel too inconsistent. ""That's part of this process in general, it's not going to be a smooth ride and that's what I'm going to try to improve every time I'm out there."" Clijsters fell behind 3-0 in the first set as she struggled to find rhythm with her serve. But the four-time major champion turned the tables in the second, pounding winners to the delight of the supportive crowd on an overcast day in the Southern California desert. Momentum shifted back in the Czech's favour in the fifth game of the decider when Clijsters missed an open forehand on game point that would have put the players back on serve. From there, Siniakova was able to coast to the finish. Siniakova, a former world number one doubles player who took home gold at the Tokyo Games playing with Barbora Krejcikova, will next face 10th seeded Angelique Kerber.

sports,"Courage were unaware of sexual misconduct allegations against coach, says owner"," NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - North Carolina Courage owner Steve Malik said the team only became aware of sexual harassment and coercion allegations against former coach Paul Riley when they were reported last week. National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) games at the weekend were postponed after Riley was subsequently fired by the Courage and the league. The Portland Thorns on Monday said they had terminated Riley's contract in 2015 after receiving a complaint about their then-coach and shared what they had learned in their own investigation with the NWSL. He was subsequently hired by the now-defunct Western New York Flash. In a statement on Wednesday, Malik said while he was aware of an investigation into Riley's behavior with the Thorns in 2015, he was ""assured (Riley) was in good standing"" during due diligence conducted when he purchased the Flash in 2017. The Courage was founded in 2017 after Malik acquired the franchise rights from the Flash. ""During his employment with the Courage, we had no knowledge of allegations of sexual harassment or coercion. When we learned of the horrific allegations in last week?�s reporting, we took those seriously and immediately terminated Mr. Riley,"" said Malik. ""Such abuse has no place in our society or in our sport, and it will never be tolerated by the North Carolina Courage organization."" The Athletic said Riley denied ""the majority"" of the allegations detailed in its report. Attempts to reach Riley for comment were unsuccessful. The NWSL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The allegations have prompted investigations by the NWSL, U.S. Soccer and FIFA. The Thorns said there had been ""a systemic failure across women's professional soccer."" Football Australia announced it was implementing a ""complaint management procedure"" after retired striker Lisa De Vanna said she had been the victim of sexual assault and harassment during her career. The NWSL was set to resume on Wednesday, with the North Carolina Courage taking on Racing Louisville at home, NJ/NY Gotham FC facing the Washington Spirit and the Portland Thorns playing the Houston Dash.

sports,Reports: Jets agree to extension for DL John Franklin-Myers," 2021-10-08 01:25:00 GMT+00:00 - The New York Jets agreed to a four-year contract extension with defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers, according to multiple reports Thursday. No terms were available though Franklin-Myers, a fourth-year pro, stands to improve from his $920,000 salary this season -- the last year of his rookie contract. Franklin-Myers, fresh from his 25th birthday less than two weeks earlier, is off to a strong start this season with 15 tackles, three tackles for loss and a career-high-tying three sacks while starting all four games for New York. Originally a fourth-round pick by the Rams in 2018 out of Stephen F. Austin, Franklin-Myers notched two sacks while playing sparingly for Los Angeles as a rookie. He posted a strip sack in the Rams' Super Bowl LIII loss to the New England Patriots. However, Franklin-Myers failed to make the team out of training camp in 2019. He got a chance with the Jets when they claimed him off waivers last October, though he was on injured reserve for most of last season and didn't see game action. Franklin-Myers recorded three sacks in 15 games (two starts) for New York in 2020 and won a starting spot this summer. In his three NFL campaigns, Franklin-Myers owns 44 tackles, eight sacks, three fumble recoveries and two forced fumbles. --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."

sports,Canadiens goalie Price enters player assistance program," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price, who backstopped his team to last season's Stanley Cup Final, is voluntarily stepping away from the club to enter the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program, the league and union said on Thursday. The National Hockey League and NHL Players' Association announced Price's decision in a joint statement but gave no additional details and said there would be no further comment. The player assistance program, which started as a jointly funded effort in 1996, assists players and their families with mental health, substance abuse and other matters. Canadiens head coach Dominique Ducharme said this week the 34-year-old Price was not expected to practise before the start of the season because he is ""not doing well right now"" as he recovers from a non-COVID-19 illness. Price is also recovering from off-season knee surgery. Price's wife said in a post on Instagram that part of the privilege of being in the position her family is in is that they also get a public platform to show how there is a ""path to light"" for anyone who is struggling. ""No matter what is on the line, we hope we can communicate the importance of putting your mental health first, not just by saying it, but by showing up and doing the work to get better,"" Price's wife wrote. ""Carey's showing up for himself and our family and making the absolute best decision possible for us. I will continue to show up for him and our kids and seek out the support that I may need on any given day. ""And it's incredibly important to us to show our kids that asking for help and letting yourself be supported by others is not just OK, but encouraged ??anytime, and under any circumstance."" Price, who won a gold medal with Canada at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, has spent his entire 14-year career with Montreal and last season led the team to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Final since 1993.

""There's nothing you can force or you have to stress about because we always want to do the best we can anyway."" Verstappen said he was not thinking about the final outcome too much. ""If that?�s going to be, at the end of the year, first, that's of course an amazing achievement and that?�s what we work for, right?,"" he added. ""But even if we would finish second, I think we still would have a great season and at the end of the day it?�s not really going to change my life. ""I enjoy what I?�m doing and I think that?�s also very important. For me there is not much to worry about, really."" Hamilton won in Istanbul last year on a wet and slippery track, while Verstappen ended up sixth, but this year's race is a month earlier and the surface has been water-blasted to make it more abrasive. Double world champion Fernando Alonso told reporters separately that Verstappen, who became the sport's youngest ever race winner in 2016 at 18 years old, seemed to deal with the pressure better than others.

sports,For Newcastle's long-suffering fans Christmas has come early," LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - For the Toon Army, the nickname of Newcastle United's long-suffering and fiercely loyal followers, news that the club's takeover by a Saudi Arabia-led consortium had finally been completed felt like an early Christmas present. To be more precise, it felt like all their Christmases had arrived at once from the Middle East on a black and white sleigh loaded with the world's best footballers. Confirmation that a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) had been given the go-ahead to complete a deal that hit the rocks last year means one of England's most under-achieving clubs embarks on a new era. After Wednesday's news that the obstacles to the deal had been removed -- namely a lifting of Saudi Arabia's ban on Premier League Qatar-based rights holder beIN SPort and that the Premier league was satisfied it was not a Saudi state takeover -- Newcastle fans began gathering outside the city centre stadium, braving the early autumn chill. Just after 5pm they opened cans of beer and broke into renditions of club anthem ""Blaydon Races"" to celebrate the end of 14 years of dross under the ownership of Mike Ashley. The last time there was such excitement on a non match day was when Alan Shearer signed for a then world record 15 million pounds ($20.44 million) in 1996 when the club were mixing it with big hitters. ""Yesssssssss. We can dare to hope again!"" Shearer, whose statue stands outside the gates, said. It was a sentiment shared by all Magpies fans after more than a decade of doom and gloom. ""We've got our club back,"" they chanted. Rival fans smirk at what they regard as delusions of grandeur at the north-east club who were last English champions in 1927 and have not won any domestic silverware since 1955. Even their unbridled optimism has waned in the past decade with hope disappearing down the River Tyne as the sleeping giant of a club became the epitome of mediocrity under an absent owner unwilling to fuel their dreams. In the blink of an eye, Ashley has gone and they now support one of the richest clubs in the world, even if the immediate priority for the new consortium will not be to win silverware but to ensure their Premier League status. After seven games Newcastle are winless and second from bottom of the table. Londoner Ashley was so despised by Newcastle's fans that they would welcome just about anyone into the club, provided they bring with them the precious commodity of hope. While there are well-publicised moral concerns over so-called Saudi Arabian ""sportswashing"" as the oil rich nation seeks to soften its overseas image, the Magpies' fanbase are clearly not concerned from where their saviours arrive. A poll undertaken by the Newcastle United Supporters Trust showed 93.8% of the club's fans were in favour of the takeover. Just like the bird of their nickname, the glint of silverware is intoxicating. It is not hard to understand their joy. Since Ashley's takeover in 2007, Newcastle have twice been relegated from the Premier League and, apart from finishing fifth under Alan Pardew in 2011-12, have stumbled around in the lower reaches of the table. CUT-PRICE SIGNINGS Present manager Steve Bruce is deeply unpopular -- held up as proof of Ashley's lack of ambition, hired to fight relegation battles with cut-price signings rather than challenge the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool. It has, however, not always been like this. For a while at the start of the Premier League era, in the early 1990s, when former player Kevin Keegan arrived like a returning Messiah, it appeared that anything was possible alongside the banks of the River Tyne. With millionaire local property developer John Hall as chairman, the old stadium was revamped and Keegan was given the funds to create a team in his image with the likes of Peter Beardsley, Andy Cole, David Ginola, Robert Lee and Colombian firecracker Faustino Asprilla, to name but a few, arriving. Newcastle finished third in the Premier League in 1994, their first season back in the top flight, having almost fallen into the third-tier a couple of years earlier. Dubbed the ""The Great Entertainers"", Newcastle finished runners-up in 1996 after suffering a late collapse that saw them pipped by Manchester United in a finale to a season that will forever be remembered for Keegan's wide-eyed ""I will love it"" rant at Alex Ferguson. With Shearer signed to lead the line they also came second to Manchester United a year later and Keegan left in 1997, the same year Freddy Shepherd replaced Hall as chairman. Kenny Dalglish and Ruud Gullit both failed and although former England manager Bobby Robson staged a renaissance with fourth and third-placed finishes, he was sacked in 2004, precipitating a downward spiral. The days when Ginola, Beardsley, Les Ferdinand, Shearer and the like had the Toon Army in dreamland now seem like a distant memory -- but as Shearer said the dream is alive again.

sports,Murray makes online plea to help find stolen wedding ring," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Airing his sweaty tennis shoes outside a California hotel room has landed Andy Murray in trouble at home after the shoes were stolen - along with his wedding ring tied to one of the laces. Murray, who married Kim Sears in 2015, has played with his wedding ring attached to one of his laces ever since and did so when he took part in a practice session ahead of his opener in the Indian Wells tournament against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. The theft prompted the Scot to issue a video plea on Twitter on Thursday in an attempt to recover the ring. ""Last night after dinner in Indian Wells, I got back in the car to go back to the hotel and it didn't smell great. I'd left my tennis shoes in there ... it's been like 38-39 degrees so the shoes are damp, sweaty and smelly,"" Murray said in the video. ""I decided when I got back to the hotel that the shoes needed some air, I needed to dry them out a bit ... I have no balcony in my room and didn't want to leave them in my room to stink the room out. ""So I thought I'm going to leave the shoes under the car ... overnight. When I got back to the car in the morning the shoes were gone. I had to go to a local pro shop to buy different shoes to what I normally wear ... which isn't the end of the world but not ideal. ""I was preparing for my practice when my physio said to me 'where's your wedding ring?' And I was like 'oh no' .... So yeah, my ring has been stolen as well.

sports,Tsitsipas anticipates fewer bathroom breaks in Indian Wells," Oct 6 (Reuters) - Stefanos Tsitsipas, who came under scrutiny at the U.S. Open for the timing and length of his mid-match bathroom breaks, on Wednesday said the dry conditions in Indian Wells will mean fewer trips to the restroom. ""It's very dry here,"" Tsitsipas said ahead of his first match at the tournament in the Southern California desert, where he is seeded second. ""That is good for me because I sweat less, which makes for less bathroom breaks, which makes for less complaints. So a very good sign so far,"" he said with a smile. The Greek unwillingly assumed the role of villain at Flushing Meadows when Briton Andy Murray accused him of cheating over a lengthy trip to the bathroom at a critical point in their first-round match, which Tsitsipas won. Tsitsipas insisted at the time that he was innocent of wrongdoing since there are no time limits on bathroom breaks. An ATP Tour source last month told Reuters that changes to the rules for bathroom breaks and on-court medical timeouts were in the works. The world No. 3 also made headlines this summer when he said he would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine unless it was made mandatory by the ATP Tour, prompting a rebuke from Greek government officials. On Wednesday, Tsitsipas declined to say whether he has been vaccinated. ""I'm sorry but I'm not able to provide any of my medical records,"" he said.

sports,Hamilton and Verstappen renew battle in Turkey," Oct 6 (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton clinched his seventh Formula One world championship in Turkey last year while Max Verstappen had a race to forget, but this time the title remains wide open and the Dutch driver could be the one celebrating on Sunday. Only two points separate Mercedes' championship leader Hamilton from his Red Bull rival with six races left after Istanbul and the battle set to go down to the wire. One mistake, one retirement -- whether a mechanical failure or collision -- would be a massive blow at this stage in the season and Hamilton may yet have to take a new engine and penalty. Verstappen turned 24 last week and an eighth win of the season would put him back on top after Hamilton, 36, seized the advantage in Russia two weeks' ago with his 100th career victory. Red Bull will also have a special livery on their cars as a tribute to departing engine partner Honda on what would have been the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, but for the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Last year's Turkish GP was of course not the best weekend for us as a team but I think it will be quite different circumstances this year, hopefully the Tarmac will be a bit more grippy,"" said Verstappen, who finished sixth in the 2020 race. ""I think it will be quite a new weekend in general for everyone, there will be a lot to learn so I?�m looking forward to seeing how competitive we are there."" Verstappen has been on pole eight times this year to Hamilton's three and narrowly missed out on the top slot in Turkey last year. Last year's race was the first at the Istanbul track since 2011 and the freshly resurfaced and slippery track triggered plenty of complaints. Hamilton, the winner on that wet November afternoon, compared conditions to an ice-rink and said organisers had wasted their money. That should not be such a problem this time, with the surface blasted to make it less slippery and Pirelli bringing softer tyres for a race that is also being held a month earlier. There will also be a crowd, unlike last year's race behind closed doors, with organisers hoping for 100,000 over three days. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said his team were still buzzing after the success of Sochi but 'fortunes can change in the blink of an eye'. ""This season is keeping all of us on our toes and that's something we're enjoying immensely, but it also means we have to be aggressive with our approach to the season, in order to maximise the points available,"" added the Austrian. ""It's an exciting track layout and a good one for racing, so I think we'll be in for another spectacular twist in this brilliant F1 season."" Canadian Lance Stroll was on pole last year for Racing Point, now Aston Martin, in a career first but it will take something special to be back at the front this time. Lando Norris put McLaren on pole on a wet Russian weekend, and was heading for his first win until late rain wrecked his hopes, and they could again be in the mix if the weather proves tricky. ""I've been spending a lot of time in the simulator, learning from the experience in Russia, and I'm ready to go again,"" said the Briton.

World number four Zverev's ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova said in an interview with online magazine Slate on Aug. 25 that the German was emotionally and physically abusive to her during their relationship. The ATP had faced increasing criticism for failing to look into the allegations until the men's tennis governing body announced on Monday it was conducting an investigation. The Olympic gold medallist has repeatedly denied the allegations and now hopes an ATP investigation will clear his name.

""I have been asking them to do that since London last year because it is very hard for me to clear my name. ""Only with something like this I can. ""It has been around for a year and there is not much more I can do to clear my name and I hope this will finally do it."" The 24-year-old has ""categorically and unequivocally"" denied having abused Sharypova and said on Aug. 27 that his lawyers had initiated legal action against the author of the allegations. Slate issued a statement saying it stood by its ""fair and accurate reporting"". ""I have been in court in Germany which I won the case against the author and the publications which the author is ignoring right now,"" said Zverev. ""I have proven I am innocent in a lot of different ways. ""I think with this investigation that is now finally happening I hope this can be done and dusted from a third individual party and we can move on with everything else."" Zverev said the entire affair has not only been a distraction for him but the entire sport. On the court, however, Zverev has managed to remain focused and is enjoying one of the best seasons of his young career, winning an Olympic gold medal and two Masters Series events. ""Andy Murray said it very well last week in San Diego, when stars of the game they win tennis matches, they win big matches you want to talk about that,"" said Zverev, who also reached the semi-finals of both the French and U.S. Opens this year. ""I have had one of the most incredible seasons a young guy has had in the last probably 10 years winning the Olympics, winning two Masters Series, winning four tournaments and that is kind of forgotten a little bit.

sports,Amnesty voices human rights concerns as Saudi takeover of Newcastle looms," Oct 7 (Reuters) - Amnesty International called on the Premier League on Thursday to focus on human rights issues and ""sportswashing"" as Newcastle United's proposed sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) inched closer. The PIF - chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - wants to buy Newcastle for a reported 305 million pounds ($415 million), with media reports indicating the deal could be announced later on Thursday. ""Ever since this deal was first talked about we said it represented a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football,"" Saudi Arabia's $430 billion sovereign wealth fund PIF is at the centre of the kingdom's efforts to diversify its economy beyond oil. The original Newcastle deal collapsed in July 2020 amid scrutiny from the Premier League, which came under pressure to stop the sale due to concerns over alleged broadcast piracy in Saudi Arabia. The piracy dispute involved Qatari-owned beIN Sports, the Premier League's broadcast rights holder across the Middle East, which had been barred from operating in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia lifted that ban on Wednesday, clearing a major hurdle to the Newcastle deal. But concerns about the kingdom's human rights record remain. ""Instead of allowing those implicated in serious human rights violations to walk into English football simply because they have deep pockets, we've urged the Premier League to change their owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues,"" Amnesty's Deshmukh said. ""The phrase 'human rights' doesn't even appear in the owners' and directors' test despite English football supposedly adhering to FIFA standards. ""We've sent the Premier League a suggested new human rights-compliant test and we reiterate our call on them to overhaul their standards on this."" The Premier League did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saudi Arabia's government denies allegations of human rights abuses and says it is protecting national security from extremists and external actors. The BBC had earlier reported that PIF, which is providing 80% of the funding for the deal, would be treated as separate to the Saudi state under the ownership test, meaning concerns over piracy or human rights abuses should not affect the bid. ""The Premier League needs to better understand the dynamic of sportswashing and tighten its ownership rules,"" Deshmukh said. Separately, Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, urged the Premier League not to approve the takeover. Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, but his body has never been found. A U.S. intelligence report said the prince had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report's findings. ""It is horrifying to learn that the Crown Prince is on the brink of getting what he wants: to wash his reputation, and sully the name of sports,"" she told the Daily Telegraph on Thursday. ""I urge the Premier League not to cave in now ??this is the moment to show courage and principle. It will show the killers they cannot wash away their crimes.""

sports,F1 veteran Grosjean passes Indy 500 rookie test," Oct 6 (Reuters) - A veteran of 179 Formula One starts, Romain Grosjean was back in class on Wednesday passing his Indianapolis 500 Rookie Orientation Program (ROP), setting the 35-year-old Frenchman up for a shot at qualifying for the ""Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" next May. Grosjean, who made the jump to IndyCar this year, had told his family he would not race on the more dangerous ovals after a fiery crash in Bahrain that ended his F1 career. But after an impressive first season with Dale Coyne Racing,  Grosjean last month made the move to IndyCar powerhouse Andretti Autosport with the goal of winning the driver's title which would mean driving ovals. ""You can't go in the top ten if you are not doing all races. They do want me fighting for championships, they want me at the front and I feel comfortable with my decision,"" said Grosjean.  ""You need to respect ovals a lot. ""It doesn't feel fast when everything goes well but for sure if you start losing the rear end you know the wall is there. ""I feel like my level of happiness through my professional life, being able to share that with my family is the risk that we take."" Grosjean's rookie IndyCar campaign produced three podium finishes, two on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) road course, and one pole. He also dipped his toe in the oval waters running at Gateway Grand Prix placing 14th. IMS, however, is a completely different beast: a massive 2.5 mile (4km) oval that has frightened off many top drivers. Grosjean's first run at the Brickyard was an abbreviated one that saw the Frenchman get his DHL Honda running the final of three phases (15 laps at 215 mph plus) when rain cut short the test. IndyCar officials, however, deemed Grosjean and fellow Indy 500 novice seven-time NASCAR Cup champion Jimmie Johnson had passed their rookie tests even though both were a few laps short of completing the final phase. Both will have the opportunity to finish their remaining laps during the IMS open test next April. ""It went pretty well, it was a pretty smooth day apart from the weather,"" said Grosjean. ""The most stressful part was what was my first lap speed going to be and you move from there. ""I had no idea what to expect to get to 205 mph and it went smoothly. ""Eventually when you have to go about 215 mph, that's where the fun starts.""

sports,Governing body ICC to switch to inclusive 'batter' from T20 World Cup," MUMBAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The International Cricket Council will change ""batsman"" to the gender-neutral term ""batter"" in its playing conditions starting from this month's Twenty20 World Cup, the world governing body said on Thursday. The Lord's-based Marylebone Cricket Club, the sole authority on the laws of the game since it was founded in 1787, last month made the change in the Laws of Cricket to stress the importance of the women's game. ""The ICC has been utilising the term batter for some time now across our channels and in commentary and we welcome the MCC's decision to implement it into the Laws of cricket and will follow suit with our playing conditions that are derived from the Laws,"" said ICC acting CEO Geoff Allardice. ""This is a natural and perhaps overdue evolution of our sport and now our batters are gender-neutral in the same way as bowlers, fielders and wicket keepers! ""It's a small change, but one that I hope will have significant impact on cricket being viewed as a more inclusive sport."" The preliminary round matches of the men's T20 World Cup will start on Oct. 17 in United Arab Emirates and Oman. England won the 2017 women's World Cup final in front of a capacity crowd at Lord's while the women's World T20 final between Australia and India in 2020 attracted more than 80,000 to the Melbourne Cricket Ground in increasing signs of popularity of the women's game. Women's cricket will also feature at the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 2022 in Birmingham, England. ""Why not take a small step to ensuring we're a sport that doesn't exclude 50% of the world's population with outdated language choices,"" Allardice said. ""Whilst some may have made lots of noise against this common-sense change, the majority of people within the game have welcomed the move.""

sports,Women to race with men in 'groundbreaking' SailGP shift," LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - SailGP will include female sailors in its adrenaline-filled racing for the first time this week by adding an extra crew position aboard its ""foiling"" catamarans. There have been few routes for top female sailors to progress beyond events such as the Olympics and SailGP has implemented a pathway in an effort to address this gap. The $1 million prize competition, co-founded in 2018 by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and SailGP CEO Russell Coutts, is in its second season and will see eight crews line up off Cadiz in Spain this weekend for the final event of its European leg. One of those sailing in Spain will be Britain's Hannah Mills who became the most successful ever female Olympic sailor when she and Eilidh McIntyre won gold in the 470 dinghy at Tokyo, adding to her gold at Rio and silver at the London Games. ""This is pretty groundbreaking for female sailors and the sport ... I know how inspiring it would have been for me when I was young,"" Mills told Reuters from Cadiz. SailGP said those competing along with Mills would be Nina Curtis for Australia, Katja Salskov-Iversen for Denmark, Amelie Riou for France, Sena Takano for Japan, Erica Dawson for New Zealand, Andrea Emone for Spain and CJ Perez for the U.S. ""The more professional opportunities there are, the more females will participate,"" said Mills, who has been picked by Ben Ainslie to join his Great Britain SailGP team after trials. ""It's adrenaline-fuelled like no other sailing I've ever done. The speed and the G-forces you get going round corners are absolutely phenomenal. It can feel like the boat is on the edge,"" Mills said of the futuristic F50 craft. Ainslie, who is the most successful male Olympic sailor, said it was a ""great"" development, adding that Mills and others ""can and will play a significant part"" in both SailGP and the America's Cup, which is planning a women's event. ""Hannah is a great team player. Talent speaks for itself. Results speak for themselves. In female sailing they don't get any better,"" Ainslie said of Mills. ""She is just as motivated, if not more motivated to win than the rest of us,"" he told Reuters, adding that Mills would be involved in tactical calls and how the vast ""wing"" is set. For Mills, who set out to win Olympic gold at an early age, moving from practice to full-blown F50 racing opens another chapter in the wake of a feat which is still sinking in. ""I never started my Olympic journey hoping to achieve that ... I can't quite believe that it happened,"" she said.

sports,Report: Urban Meyer makes latest apologies to Jaguars," 2021-10-06 17:32:34 GMT+00:00 - Jacksonville Jaguars coach Urban Meyer continued his rounds of apologies on Wednesday, this time addressing his team about his behavior in Ohio last week. NFL Network characterized Meyer as ""honest and pretty forthright"" as he talked to the players, adding he ""expressed remorse and asked for forgiveness."" Meyer has been under fire since a video emerged on Saturday that showed him at a bar he owns in Columbus with a young woman dancing close to him. A second video emerged Monday, taken from another angle, that appeared to show Meyer touching the woman's bottom. He told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that while owner Shad Khan has expressed disappointment, Meyer has not been fined. The embattled first-year coach also said he hasn't considered resigning. Meyer and his wife, Shelley, have been married since 1986 and have three children. The woman in the video has not been identified but was not Shelley Meyer. The NFL Network report said Meyer told the team he ""cares about two things, really. Football and family, and he embarrassed them both."" Meyer, 57, discussed the fallout Tuesday night on his radio show on station 1010XL in Jacksonville. ""I made a comment when I got here about the logo, about an owner who wants to win in the worst way,"" Meyer said. ""That's one of the reasons I came here. I just, I admire that guy so much. ... And so, that's what makes me so angry at myself that I lived that, I believe that and I failed."" He said the conversations he's been forced to hold this week with members of the organizations have been ""horrible."" ""The fact that I became a distraction, I've got to earn their trust back from that,"" Meyer said. On Tuesday, Khan said Meyer must do just that. ""I have addressed this matter with Urban,"" Khan wrote in a statement. ""... His conduct last weekend was inexcusable. I appreciate Urban's remorse, which I believe is sincere. Now, he must regain our trust and respect. That will require a personal commitment from Urban to everyone who supports, represents or plays for our team. I am confident he will deliver."" Meyer is in his first year with the Jaguars after leading Florida and Ohio State to three national titles. The Jaguars are 0-4 and have lost 19 consecutive games dating back to their victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the 2020 season opener. Jacksonville squandered a 14-point halftime lead last Thursday and lost a 24-21 heartbreaker to the Cincinnati Bengals. Meyer also has been criticized for not accompanying his young team back to Florida and instead remaining in Ohio to visit with his grandchildren. He told reporters Wednesday that he got the OK from general manager Trent Baalke to stay in Ohio. --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Fury promises to knockout Wilder in heated press conference ahead of trilogy fight," Oct 6 (Reuters) - A furious Tyson Fury vowed to knockout Deontay Wilder when the two rivals meet for the third time on Saturday in Las Vegas with the Briton's WBC heavyweight title on the line. The undefeated Fury (30-0-1), who battled Wilder (42-1-1) to a draw in 2018 before taking the belt from the American 20 months ago, was the aggressor in Wednesday's press conference, repeatedly berating the former champion. ""You're a weak man and you're getting knocked out,"" said Fury, who wore a colorful suit with a pattern of WBC belts on it at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. ""Your legacy will be in tatters. Torn to bits. Finished,"" he added during a particularly heated back-and-forth near the end of the event, which led organizers to call off a planned face-off for the cameras. Fury was particularly bothered by Wilder's claims that the ""Gypsy King"" cheated in their last meeting by illegally tampering with his gloves ahead of the seventh-round stoppage. Saturday's fight was scheduled for July 24 before Fury's positive COVID-19 test forced a postponement. Fury welcomed a baby girl nearly two months ago but she had to be placed into the hospital's intensive care unit. He said he spent two weeks by her side before she came home. ""I knew if I got that hurdle out of the way, things would be good and I could concentrate on the fight,"" he said. ""Daddy's just got to do his job. That's it,"" he said. Wilder, sporting a blood red track suit with the words ""Eye for an eye"" written on it in Russian, appeared more relaxed, saying he had ""nothing to lose and everything to gain"" in the fight. ""I'm in a great place, a great state of mind,"" Wilder said. ""There's nothing to prove at all. This right here in redemption, retaliation and retribution."" Wilder's trainer Malik Scott said the two have been working to expand the knockout artist's toolbox while Fury's trainer Sugar Hill Steward said their focus has been on fine-tuning the ""already exceptional"" Fury. The winner is expected to face Oleksandr Usykget, who holds the other three titles, for a chance to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lenox Lewis 21 years ago.

Gauff, who shot to fame as a 15-year-old when she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2019, urged the 18-year-old Raducanu to take time away from her phone. "" ... It is exciting when you get all the retweets, all the follows and all of that, but it can be a bit overwhelming. At least in my experience. That's probably what I wish I would've known, not to focus on social media,"" said the world number 19. Roger Federer, a 20-times Grand Slam champion, also recently suggested that the next generation of tennis stars like Raducanu needed help to prevent abuse on social media affecting them. ""I put a time limit on my phone because I thought I was spending too much time on it. From 8:30am to 9:30pm I have limited access to apps,"" Gauff added. Gauff and Raducanu will be in action this week at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, which returns after two years following the COVID-19 pandemic.

sports,Murray has no qualms about taking wildcards," Oct 6 (Reuters) - Andy Murray does not feel bad taking wildcards away from younger players given all he achieved in tennis before missing time due to hip surgeries, he said on Wednesday at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Critics suggest wildcards are better suited to up-and-coming players but Briton Murray, a three-times Grand Slam champion and former world number one who had hip surgeries in 2018 and 2019, feels otherwise. ""After what I've gone through the last three, four years and what I've achieved for the game beforehand, I don't feel like I need to justify the reasons for why I should get wildcards,"" Murray, 34, told reporters. Among the other wildcard recipients for the hardcourt event at Indian Wells are British teenager and U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu and 38-year-old Belgian Kim Clijsters, a former women's world number one and four-times Grand Slam winner. Murray, who is far from the tournament-winning form he enjoyed during the mid-2010s, has fallen to 121st in the world rankings. The twice Olympic champion said he is grateful to have the opportunity to compete as a wildcard. ""I'd rather get in by right, obviously, but then I could also argue that for three years I was out injured when I would have rightfully been entered into all of these tournaments,"" Murray said. ""I would've been ranked at the top of the game and would've been getting into all of these tournaments so (other) players would have obviously had the opportunity to take that spot for the last three seasons or whatever.""

Rahm is after a hat-trick of titles at Club de Campo Villa de Madrid, having previously won in 2018 and 2019. The 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It would be very unique.

Up against the likes of Marco Verratti and Jorginho, Gavi showed no signs of being overawed, producing a debut of rare confidence in the 2-1 win that set up a final against Belgium or France on Sunday. Composed on the ball, confident throughout and always looking to bring Spain's attacking players into the game, Gavi's performance left his coach purring.

sports,U.S. Justice Department renews inquiry into FBI's failures in Larry Nassar probe," WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has launched a fresh inquiry into the FBI's botched handling of its sex abuse investigation into disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, after previously declining to prosecute the agents involved, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said on Tuesday. ""The recently confirmed assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division is currently reviewing this matter, including new information that has come to light,"" Monaco told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, adding that she is ""constrained"" on what more she can say. ""I do want the committee and frankly, I want the survivors to understand how exceptionally seriously we take this issue,"" she added. In an emotional hearing last month, famous gymnasts including Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney appeared before the same Senate panel, where they blasted the FBI for failing to properly investigate abuse they suffered under Nassar's care. The hearing was prompted by a scathing investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general Michael Horowitz, which uncovered widespread and dire errors which allowed Nassar to continue to abuse at least 70 more victims before he was finally arrested. Two former FBI agents were singled out in the report - the former Indianapolis field office Special Agent in Charge W. Jay Abbott and a former supervisory special agent who has since been identified as Michael Langeman. Horowitz said the agents waited five weeks before conducting a phone interview with just one victim - Maroney - while failing to contact other victims. Langeman did not properly document Maroney's interview until more than a year later, and when he did, it contained misstatements and omissions. He was only recently fired from the bureau. Horowitz also said that Abbott violated ethics rules by trying to get a job with the U.S. Olympic Committee in the midst of the investigation, and later lied during his interview with the inspector general's office. Abbott retired in 2018. The inspector general referred both former agents for prosecution, but the Justice Department declined to bring charges against them in September 2020. After the declination, the inspector general managed to compel interviews with more witnesses, but in May 2021, the department declined to revisit the issue. Republican Senator John Cornyn on Tuesday expressed skepticism the Justice Department would take any action six years after the misconduct occurred, and asked Monaco what the statute of limitations is for lying to criminal investigators. Monaco said she believed the limit is five years. ""So here we are six years later. Isn't it likely that any criminal charges for lying to the FBI would be barred by the statute of limitations?"" Cornyn asked. The FBI first learned of the allegations of sexual abuse against Nassar in July 2015. Monaco said she did not wish to get into specifics about what evidence or legal theories could apply in the case. Two U.S. senators, Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Jerry Moran, said in a statement they were encouraged by the new Justice Department inquiry. After the review, the senators said: ""We expect the Department of Justice to provide the kind of public explanation for its final prosecution decision that has so far been lacking."" Monaco's testimony comes after she faced harsh criticism from some of the lawmakers on the panel and the gymnasts themselves, who chastised her for declining a request to testify and answer questions about the department's decision to decline charging the agents. The Justice Department's policy prohibits publicly discussing decisions not to prosecute. Monaco told lawmakers she was ""outraged"" to learn about the inspector general's findings. ""I am deeply sorry that in this case, the victims did not receive the response or the protection that they deserved,"" she said. An attorney for Abbott could not be immediately reached. Langeman could not be reached. Our Standards: The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval on Tuesday to legislation temporarily raising the government's borrowing limit to $28.9 trillion, pushing off the deadline for debt default only until December."
sports,'We're here for him': Coach says Nets' Irving misses Brooklyn practice," NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Seven-time All-Star Kyrie Irving did not participate in the Brooklyn Nets' first practice at home on Tuesday, head coach Steve Nash told reporters, as the NBA began to feel the impact of local COVID-19 vaccine restrictions. ""Kyrie's not here today,"" said Nash. ""No further update. We support him. We support him, we're here for him. If things change then - if there's a resolution, we're here for him."" The National Basketball Association has not mandated vaccines for players but must nonetheless abide by local restrictions in New York City and San Francisco, where players will have to sit out home games if they are not inoculated. Irving has reportedly not been vaccinated and was unable to attend media day last month due to health and safety protocols according to ESPN. Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins' requested a religious exemption from the vaccine, as the city of San Francisco has a requirement for large indoor events. His request was denied last month and he later received the shot. The league has said players who are unable to compete due to local mandates will miss out on pay.

sports,Spain end Italy's long unbeaten run to reach Nations League final," MILAN, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Spain ended European champions Italy's world record 37-match unbeaten run as Ferran Torres scored twice in a 2-1 win at the San Siro stadium in an entertaining Nations League semi-final on Wednesday. Italy, trailing by two goals at the break, had to play the entire second half with 10 men after captain Leonardo Bonucci was sent off but showed real determination as they sought to avoid their first loss since a September, 2018 defeat by Portugal. ""This what matches are like, sometimes certain episodes can influence them,"" Italy coach Roberto Mancini said. ""This is a disappointment. We should have stayed with 11 men, we made a mistake that you can?�t make at this level,"" he added. Spain will face the winners of Thursday's semi-final  between France and Belgium in Sunday's decider. Torres put Spain ahead in the 17th minute, steering a left-wing cross from Mikel Oyarzabal past Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma into the far corner. Donnarumma, booed by AC Milan fans angered at his recent move from the club to Paris St Germain, nearly gifted Spain a second when he fumbled a harmless Marcos Alonso effort against the post but Bonucci scrambled the ball clear. Any lingering questions about the importance of the match had been blown away by the blistering start and it was by no means one-way traffic, as Italy started to open up the Spanish defence. Federico Bernardeschi went close to an equaliser with a low drive from the right which Spain keeper Unai Simon pushed against the post and Lorenzo Insigne missed a great chance, firing wide when in space on the edge of the box. The Azzurri, who beat Spain on penalties in the Euro 2020 semi-final in July, went a man down in the 42nd minute when Bonucci was sent off for a second yellow card after elbowing Sergio Busquets. FINE CROSS Torres sent Luis Enrique's side in with a two-goal lead at the break when he was left unmarked to head in another fine cross from Oyarzabal. Italy brought on Giorgio Chiellini at the break, the veteran defender and leader having been a surprise omission, and despite Spain playing with real swagger, the Azzurri stayed in the game. Spain had given a debut to Barcelona's 17 year-old midfielder Gavi, who became their youngest ever player after just three starts for his club -- but there was no hint of his inexperience in a confident and composed performance. Enrico Chiesa was the source of Italy's brightest moments and he hit the post from a tight angle in the 61st minute Oyarzabal headed wide after excellent work from another teenager, winger Yeremi Pino, and Marcos Alonso should have sealed the win in the 78th minute but his low shot was well saved by Donnarumma. Italy ensured a tense end to a quality match when they pulled a goal back seven minutes from the end, as Chiesa took advantage of hesitant Spanish defending, broke from the halfway line and slipped the ball to substitute Lorenzo Pellegrini to convert. But Italy's run was over and with it ended the dream of a Nations League title on home soil to follow their Euro triumph. For Spain though, the revenge for the Wembley loss was sweet. ""We knew it was a special game, we went out in the semi-finals of the Euros and what better way to beat them at home in other semi-finals,"" Torres said. Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."

""I'm here to tell you that I'm going to retire from professional basketball. It's a difficult decision after so many years but it's a decision I've taken carefully,"" Gasol, 41, told a news conference at Barcelona's Liceu theatre. Gasol, who stands 7 feet 1 inch, made his professional debut in 1998 with Barca as a centre before being signed by NBA side Memphis Grizzlies in 2001. He won NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010 while being chosen in the All-Star team on six occasions. Gasol later played for Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs and had a brief stint with Milwaukee Bucks plus four months at Portland Trail Blazers, where injury prevented him playing. He returned to Barcelona earlier this year, helping his boyhood club end a seven-year wait to win the Spanish championship in June. Gasol was a talisman for Spain, helping them win the Olympic silver medal at the 2008 and 2012 Games plus bronze in 2016. He recovered from almost two years out injured to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, where Spain lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners the USA in his final international. Gasol began the news conference by detailing his battle to overcome a stress fracture he suffered in his left foot in 2019. ""Not many doctors thought I'd be able to recover but I'm a person who likes challenges and I wanted to fight to do the improbable,"" he said. ""I got to the point where I was relaxed about my career ending, I was at peace. But when things went well I took the decision to sign for Barcelona which wasn't in my plans. But I managed to win the league with the club where it all began and where I made my debut. It's been very special."" Gasol also paid tribute to the late Kobe Bryant, his old Lakers team mate who died in a helicopter accident in January 2020. ""I'd have liked him to have been here today but sometimes life is unfair,"" Gasol added. ""He taught me to a better competitor, a real winner, I considered him like an older brother.""

sports,Kyler Murray takes over as consensus NFL MVP favorite," 2021-10-06 01:07:47 GMT+00:00 - The Arizona Cardinals are the lone remaining unbeaten team through four weeks of the NFL season, and the man who has led them to that 4-0 record is now the consensus favorite to win league MVP honors. Kyler Murray had ascended the list of contenders at sportsbooks through a hot September, but now he owns the shortest odds at major sportsbooks after leading a 37-20 upset of the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. Murray finished 24-of-32 passing for 268 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions against the Rams' typically stout defense. He is third in the league with 1,273 passing yards with nine touchdowns against four interceptions. Installed before the season at +2500 by BetMGM, Murray is now the +500 MVP favorite at the sportsbook. He is followed by another rapidly rising quarterback in Buffalo's Josh Allen, who has moved from +1600 to +650 in leading the Bills to a 3-1 start. Both have passed preseason favorite Patrick Mahomes, who still has the third-shortest odds at +750 in guiding Kansas City to a 2-2 start. Just behind him is Chargers second-year star Justin Herbert, who has rocketed from +2200 to +800. Murray has even shorter odds at DraftKings, where he is the +450 favorite ahead of Mahomes (+650), Allen (+700) and Herbert (+750). Murray is +475 ahead of Mahomes (+550) at PointsBet, where Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady has the third-shortest odds at +800. It still remains a wide open race with three-quarters of the regular season remaining. Brady had been among the top three favorites just two weeks ago when the Bucs were 2-0. A loss to the Rams followed by a narrow win at New England resulted in Brady's odds lengthening to +1000 at BetMGM along with Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers and Dallas' Dak Prescott. Meanwhile, DraftKings is offering Prescott at +800, Rodgers at +1000 and Brady at +1400 with Matthew Stafford, who was among the favorites before the Rams' offense scuffled in the loss to Arizona. The top non-quarterback remains Tennessee running back Derrick Henry, who is a +5000 longshot at BetMGM and PointsBet and has even longer odds at +10000 at DraftKings.

But now the British sensation says she is eager to get back to business.

""But after that, I just went straight back to training and focusing on this competition and the upcoming ones I've got lined up.""

With the victory, she became the first British woman to win a Grand Slam tournament in 44 years, creating a frenzy in her home country. She said that while she appreciates the support, she is determined to stay focused, opting mostly to stay home with her family since returning to England.

Confirmation of the now-retired Carter's positive test came from the Chairman of the Jamaica Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel and the sprinter's lawyer Stuart Stimpson. ?�We have a matter with Nesta Carter ... We do have a disciplinary hearing that was referred to me by JADCO (Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission),??Kent Gammon told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday. Gammon, who declined to name the banned substance, said the disciplinary hearing will start on Oct. 14. Stimpson declined to provide any details on the substance or the circumstances surrounding Carter's positive test. The latest anti-doping violation comes three years after Carter lost his appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the International Olympic Committee's decision to strip him and the rest of the Jamaica men's sprint relay team, comprising Bolt, Asafa Powell and Michael Frater, of their gold medals from the 2008 Beijing Games. In August, 35-year-old Carter issued a news release saying he had retired due to a private medical condition which had hindered him from training and competing since March 2021. He indicated at the time that a medication prescribed by his doctor to treat the condition violated anti-doping rules and as such he had chosen his health over athletics. Carter has a personal best of 9.78 seconds for the 100 metres, which ranks as the ninth fastest time ever and the fourth best by a Jamaican sprinter in history.

Tomori has tried not to dwell on his Chelsea frustration. ""When that opportunity came at Milan I was so excited and I'm happy it's gone so well so far,"" he said. ""The club has shown a lot of faith in me and I feel very settled and that's led me to be here."" ""There is a pressure to win and you feel the weight of the history of the club.

Harris, who along with compatriot David Blitzer joined Palace chairman Steve Parish with a general partnership stake in the club in 2015, added that they had to be more strategic in the transfer market to compete with their moneyed rivals. ""There's a lot of money exchanged for different players ... whereas in the U.S. leagues those are highly regulated, they are very restricted,"" Harris, who also owns NBA team the Philadelphia 76ers and NHL franchise the New Jersey Devils, said at the Leaders Week sports conference. ""The NFL, the NBA, the NHL and the MLB all go to great lengths to make sure that everyone has the same shot to win, meaning there are limits to what you can spend on players.

""We (Palace) are scrappy and on the move and in mid-table, hopefully moving towards the top 10. So for us it?�s fun, it?�s enjoyable,"" added Harris, with Palace sitting in 14th spot. ""We like that underdog (spirit) but being on the rise. But we have to be a bit more agile, a bit more fleet of foot ??those are the differences."" Palace last finished in the top 10 in 2015 under Alan Pardew. They have flirted with relegation since but have always managed to ensure their safety come the end of the season. French World Cup-winner Vieira's appointment in the close season was meant to herald a new dawn of exciting football at Selhurst Park, especially with a focus on youth such as newly signed teenage winger Michel Olise and French striker Odsonne Edouard, after clearing out several older players. They recovered from a winless opening three Premier League games to secure an impressive 3-0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur last month and fought back to draw 2-2 with Leicester City at the weekend. However, Harris knows that the threat of relegation means any changes carry a huge amount of risk. ""Relegation certainly forces you to be focused on the immediate outcome of the team all the time,"" he said. ""Obviously, we've got very young (players) at Palace and it's working for us and Patrick Vieira has been a really great choice, we?�re very lucky to have him.

The sketch, called ""Sting Like a Bee,"" and drawn on paper in 1978 was the most sought-after work among more than 20 paintings, drawings and sketches by the former heavyweight champion that reflected Ali's interest in religion, social justice and his own career. It carried a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000. ""Ref, he did float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!"" reads the speech bubble from a boxer knocked out by an opponent whose arms are raised in victory. Ali famously used the phrase to describe his boxing style. Bonhams auctioneers said that 26 art works by Ali sold for a total of $945,524, more than three times the lower end of estimates. ""Sting Like A Bee"" was bought by a British-based collector of Ali memorabilia, Bonhams said. Other buyers were not identified. Ali's passion for art was little known but he liked to sketch as a way of unwinding after a fight or training. Some of the works for sale were traditional nature paintings, while others were more personal cartoon-like sketches. A 1979 red, white and blue painting on canvas, with the words ""I Love You America,"" sold for $150,000, while a 1967 sketch in felt pen comparing Islam to Christianity fetched $24,000. The former world heavyweight champion, who announced his conversion to Islam in 1964 after winning the title for the first time when he went by the name Cassius Clay, died in 2016 at age 74 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.

NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said the addition of the five-time Pro Bowl selection ""is a huge win in furthering our mission as a full-service union to our men on and off the field."" Per the NFLPA release, Lynch will spend his time aiding athletes through events and social media as well as help them with potential business opportunities. ""I'm always tryin' to make the most outta my time and opportunities. Ya' feel me? If you make it through pee wee, high school, college and you're lucky enough to call yourself an NFL player, you're in a situation to create and take part in (a lot of) opportunities, but you have to understand that you only get a little bit of time in that uni', so you gotta max it out and put yourself in a position to make plays on and off the turf,"" Lynch said in a statement. ""By partnering with the NFLPA and working with De Smith, I can share my path, pass down what I've been through and seen, so players can see what's really out there for them and tap in to all the resources their teams, communities and the PA have available. I wanna put them in positions to be successful in every facet of their lives from building businesses based on their passions to of course takin' care of their mentals and stackin' their chicken."" Lynch, 35, was selected by the Buffalo Bills with the No. 12 overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. He played three-plus seasons in Buffalo, then moved on to the Seattle Seahawks and retired after the 2015 season. He came out of retirement in 2017 to play two seasons for the Raiders (2017-18) and three games -- one in regular season, two in the playoffs -- with the Seahawks (2019). In his career, Lynch gained 12,627 yards from scrimmage and scored 94 touchdowns. --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Andreescu urges successful young players to remain grateful," Oct 5 (Reuters) - Bianca Andreescu said young players who achieve success should remain grateful because you never know what lies ahead, a fact the oft-injured 2019 U.S. Open champion is all too familiar with. The hard-hitting Canadian announced herself as a force in the game when, at 19-years-old, she defeated Serena Williams in the final at Flushing Meadows. Soon after that triumph she faced a number of frustrating injury setbacks, but has since put together a solid season, highlighted by a run to the fourth round in New York last month. ""Always remain grateful, even if you're having huge success, because it can all be taken away from you in a split second,"" Andreescu told reporters ahead of the start of the tournament in Indian Wells, which she also won in 2019. ""For me, it was being injured right after (winning the U.S. Open). That was really hard for me. I felt like I didn't savor it as much. That's one thing that I learned now that I wish I did back then."" Women's tennis has seen a bevy of rising young stars including 18-year-old U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu and fellow teenagers Leylah Fernandez and Coco Gauff. Andreescu said staying grounded is key. ""Don't let it go too much to your head,"" she said. ""Stay confident, obviously, but don't become stuck up. Stay humble, remain grateful and continue to work hard because as everyone says, it's easy to get to the top. But staying at the top, that's the hardest part."" Andreescu said she has needed to learn to stop dwelling on her own past successes to turn the page. ""The main thing this year for me was to stop looking in the past because that's what I was doing a lot and that's what was ruining me,"" she said. ""I would always say, 'Oh I want to play like I did back in 2019. Why am I not playing like I used to?'"" she said. ""But I had to switch that mindset and start focusing on the present moment, because the past is the past.""

sports,England committed to Ashes after Root confirms participation - report," MELBOURNE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - England have committed to touring Australia for the Ashes after players' concerns over COVID-19 conditions were resolved at a meeting between the countries' cricket boards and England captain Joe Root on Tuesday, British media reported. Root confirmed his participation in the five-test series at the meeting and will likely be joined by a full-strength squad, the Daily Telegraph reported, despite players' having voiced hesitancy over touring in a COVID-19 ""bubble"". Cricket Australia (CA) was not able to provide immediate comment. CA, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Australian authorities have been negotiating for months over the touring conditions in a country where international arrivals must isolate in quarantine hotels for 14 days, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. One of the biggest sticking points has been whether family members can join England players in Australia over the Christmas and New Year period. Australia's borders are effectively closed to non-citizens and non-permanent residents. Australia's white ball captain Aaron Finch said he sympathised ""fully"" with England players' concerns but was glad to hear a resolution had been reached. ""They?�ve played a lot of test cricket so I can understand where they?�re coming from,"" Finch told reporters on Wednesday in a video call. ""Guys are on the road for a lot longer than what tours used to go (for) when you?�re adding on quarantine at the start and potentially at the end. ""That is difficult but it?�s great to see Joe?�s (Root) supported that and they?�re going to come down."" Australian media have reported authorities are offering England's players, staff and families the use of a Gold Coast resort in Queensland state for quarantine before the first test starts in Brisbane on Dec. 8. Families who arrive for the Christmas period may be accommodated at a resort in the Yarra Valley on the fringe of Melbourne before the Boxing Day test starts Dec. 26, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Tuesday.

sports,Renault's Alpine announces new endurance entry from 2024," Oct 5 (Reuters) - Renault-owned Alpine will continue in endurance racing, and the  24 Hours of Le Mans, with a new hybrid car built to Daytona (LMDh) rules from 2024, the sportscar brand announced on Tuesday. Endurance racing has a convergence agreement from 2022 for  cars conforming to the North American-based IMSA championship to compete against Le Mans Hypercar (LMH) entries in the top category. Alpine finished third at Le Mans this year, behind Toyota, with the rebranded Signatech team that used an existing Oreca chassis and a Gibson engine. ""We?�ve decided that we will continue the current involvement in endurance and we will enter the LMDh category starting in 2024,"" Alpine chief executive Laurent Rossi told Reuters before a presentation in Paris. ""The LMDh is a version that is more in tune with what we are trying to do, financially speaking first. It?�s a bit less expensive than an LMH programme. ""LMH is closer to the Formula One area with pure absolute performance, whereas the LMDh is closer to the road cars that we are selling and for us it was also a way to build that bridge between our motorsport activities and road cars,"" he added. LMDh is cost-capped and manufacturers attracted by that option include Audi, BMW and Porsche, all joining from 2023. Rossi hoped Alpine could continue at Le Mans in 2022 and 2023, still with Signatech founder Philippe Sinault, but said that would be subject to approval of the current car by organisers the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). He said 2024 had been chosen because it would take two years to develop a new LMDh car and Alpine wanted to win rather than just participate. The purpose-built engine will be new and developed at Renault's Viry plant near Paris, with the French carmaker eager to build up the facility as a producer of high-performance powertrains. The Alpine brand is an umbrella for Renault's motorsport activities, and Rossi said the Formula One team will continue to  lead the way. ""Formula One is the top priority and endurance is going to be the next best thing. We want to do it well, both of them,"" he explained. Alpine will also be launching three new electric road car models from 2024, adding to the existing offering of the A110 sportscar, and is planning to ramp up its sales network in Europe before further expansion. Rossi said some of the design features embedded in the 2024 endurance car would likely reflect more the batch of cars after the coming trio. ""The future stylistic codes of Alpine and a couple of potential features might be embedded one way or another in the endurance prototype,"" he said.

sports,Fernandez eager to return to action after Sharapova pep talk," Oct 5 (Reuters) - Canada's Leylah Fernandez, who lost in the final of the U.S. Open, said on Tuesday she has since received advice from five-times Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova and cannot wait to get back on court. A day after falling to British teenager Emma Raducanu in last month's final, Fernandez attended New York's annual Met Gala where she had a chance to speak with Sharapova. ""She gave me some pretty good advice,"" Fernandez, 19, told reporters ahead of her return to competition this week at Indian Wells for the BNP Paribas Open. ""I don't want to disclose any of it because it's very personal for me. ""She's an amazing person. She told me her own experience and the way that she was able to bounce back and she's just a great person, great inspiration to kind of look up to."" Fernandez won the Monterrey Open in March but upped her game considerably in New York where she beat defending champion Naomi Osaka, three-times Grand Slam winner Angelique Kerber and world number two Aryna Sabalenka en route to the final. Against Raducanu, an 18-year-old qualifier making only her second Grand Slam appearance, Fernandez struggled with her serve during a straight sets loss but still showed enough to suggest she could be a lasting force. Fernandez has since faced a surge in demand for her time since the U.S. Open but credits her team for allowing her to stay focused on tennis. ""I'm very lucky to have a great team around me to just let me focus on my craft, on my tennis, and not be overwhelmed with everything that's going right now,"" said Fernandez. ""Honestly I just can't wait to be back on the tennis court competing again."" The Canadian has shot up to 28th in the rankings and is the 23rd seed at Indian Wells, where she will get a first-round bye at an event widely considered the unofficial fifth Grand Slam. While Fernandez's U.S. Open run has resulted in a slew of new off-court obligations, she admits that it has also opened the door to fun opportunities, including attending the Met Gala. ""That was definitely an experience to get ready, to put on the makeup, get the hair done, putting on the heels for the very first time,"" said Fernandez. ""It was a little hard to walk on at first. The one thing on my mind going up the stairs in the Met was don't fall down. Just walk one foot in front of the other.""

""I'm not fighting to be the greatest of all time, I'm not fighting to be a legend,"" Fury said. ""It wouldn't benefit me earning another £50m or £200m, you don't need to be rich to live my life.

France triumphed in the 2019 edition with a team also featuring Kristina Mladenovic and Pauline Parmentier that defeated Australia in the final at Perth. The Fed Cup, renamed the Billie Jean King Cup last year in honour of the American women's tennis trailblazer, was restructured into a World Cup of tennis format concluding with 12 nations competing over one week for the title. The finals were originally scheduled to be held in Budapest, Hungary, in April 2020 but were twice postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will now be held at the O2 Arena in Prague from Nov. 1 to 6. The competing nations will each play two group-stage ties to determine the winners of four three-team groups, who will then progress to the semi-finals. Each tie will consist of two singles matches and a doubles match. Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the United States are the other nations competing. Seccond seeds Australia will be without the world's top-ranked player, Ash Barty, and will instead be spearheaded by 47th-ranked Ajla Tomljanovic, Astra Sharma and Storm Sanders, together with debutants Ellen Perez and Olivia Gadecki. Barty's absence is a blow for the tournament, but five other major singles champions will be in the mix: Garbine Muguruza, Sloane Stephens, Victoria Azarenka, Angelique Kerber and Barbora Krejcikova. Olympic singles gold medallist Belinda Bencic will lead the Swiss side, while Tokyo mixed doubles champion Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova will feature in a strong Russian Tennis Federation team.

Brady was back at the Patriots' home for the first time since he left them in 2020 after two trophy-laden decades, during which he picked up six of his seven Super Bowl titles. He marked his return by surpassing Drew Brees' mark of 80,358 yards, his 269 yards against the Patriots giving him a career total 80,560. ""I think it's an amazing statistic in that so many people can share in it with me. A quarterback doesn't throw and catch. A quarterback can just throw it,"" Brady told reporters.

The 26-year-old applied for a religious exemption with the NBA but was denied, and thus risked forfeiture of at least half his $31.5 million salary for the 2021-22 season if he didn't receive the vaccine. Wiggins said he got the Johnson & Johnson single-dose shot, adding he is the only one in his family who is vaccinated.

His victory in the YellaWood 500 came after a rainstorm cut the race short with Wallace in the lead, making him the first Black driver to win a race in NASCAR's premier series since Wendell Scott did so in 1963. ""I never think about those things,"" Wallace said when asked about his historic achievement. ""But when you say it like that, it obviously brings a lot of emotion, a lot of joy to my family, fans, friends. It's pretty damn cool. Just proud to be a winner in the Cup Series."" Wallace won in a car owned by basketball great Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, who last year partnered to form a new single-car NASCAR Cup Series team with Wallace as the driver. Wallace was thrust into the spotlight last year when his calls for NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag -- which many Americans see as a symbol of oppression -- at all events were ultimately adopted. The driver was later thought to have been a victim of a racial attack when a noose, a symbol connected to lynching and America's slave history, was found in his garage at Talladega Superspeedway. The noose, according to NASCAR, was actually a garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose and the U.S. Justice Department said after an FBI investigation that Wallace was not the target of a hate crime. Although the racing world rallied behind him during the incident, Wallace would later come under fire from then U.S. President Donald Trump over the incident. ""This is for all those kids out there who want to have an opportunity in whatever they want to achieve, and be the best at what they want to do,"" said Wallace.

""Those of us who have privilege need to use their platform - I could just as easily be talking about Yemen or Syria or anything else, but right now I chose Afghanistan because it's so recent, and the Taliban takeover has changed life for so many, especially girls,"" the former Chelsea player explained.

sports,"Real, Barca influence on Spain fades along with club superpower status"," Oct 5 (Reuters) - While Real Madrid and Barcelona's superpower status a decade ago was reflected in their dominance of Spain's all-conquering national side, their decline can be measured in the very same way: Spain head to the UEFA Nations League Final Four tournament with no players from Real and four from Barcelona. Captain Sergio Busquets is the only top-level player from the Catalan contingent travelling to Italy, along with 17-year-old Gavi - who has only started three senior games - and the underperforming Sergi Roberto and Eric Garcia. It is a far cry from when the two clubs had 13 players in Spain's 2010 World Cup- and Euro 2012-winning squad, with Barca's Andres Iniesta and Xavi and Real duo Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas playing leading roles. That was also an era when the clubs were at the peak of their powers and would regularly be challenging for the Champions League, contrasting with their current struggles. Barca have lost both their opening Champions League group stage games for the first time ever and are floundering domestically, a consequence of being forced to part with Lionel Messi as their budget was slashed due to their colossal debt. Real are in a better state but last week suffered a stunning home defeat to Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League and a subsequent loss at Espanyol. Their lack of players in the Spain team has also been noticeable: Coach Luis Enrique picked no Real representatives for his Euro 2020 squad. While some Real fans suspect Luis Enrique's own feelings towards the club - who he left as a player for Barcelona - has played a part in his thinking, the harsh truth is there are few natural choices. While Real and Barcelona used to be the obvious destination for Spain's most exciting players, the clubs' priorities have changed. Real have preferred to scout Brazilian youngsters in recent years such as Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Reinier. They did sign Spaniard Brahim Diaz from Manchester City in 2019, but he has since joined AC Milan. Barcelona last year snapped up playmaker Pedri, who lit up Spain's Euro 2020 campaign yet is currently injured. But they have mostly preferred to recruit from the Netherlands rather than home, particularly since Dutchman Ronald Koeman took charge. Whereas the two clubs would routinely compete for Spain's top young talents, the best young players are now more likely to move abroad, in particular to England's Premier League, where 10 of the 23-man squad play. Manchester City signed Ferran Torres from cash-strapped Valencia last year, while Bryan Gil went from Sevilla to Tottenham in July. Wednesday's Nations League fixture with Italy is a rematch of the Euro 2020 semi-final which Roberto Mancini's side won on penalties, ending an eventful Euro 2020 campaign for Spain which did at least hold plenty of promise for the future. Only time will tell if the current generation can repeat their predecessors' achievements, but unless there is radical change, their success is unlikely to belong to Spain's two most famous clubs.

sports,"Mbappe not ruling out PSG stay, clears the air with Neymar"," PARIS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Kylian Mbappe on Tuesday fell short of saying he would leave Paris St Germain when his contract expires at the end of the season but Real Madrid president Florentino Perez said he was optimistic the France striker would join the Spanish giants. The 22-year-old told the Ligue 1 club he wanted to join Real Madrid during the close season, only for PSG to turn down the Spanish club's offers. Asked if he was going to leave next summer, Mbappe told French sports daily L'Equipe: ""I?�ve been in football long enough now to know that yesterday's truth is not necessarily today's, nor tomorrow's. If I was told that Messi was going to play at PSG, I wouldn't have believed it, so you never know what's going to happen."" Perez, however, told Spanish paper El Debate on Monday that his club would have news on Mbappe in January. ""Hopefully everything can be sorted on the first of January,"" he said. Perez's comments prompted an angry reaction from PSG sporting director Leonardo. ""It's been going on for two years,"" the Brazilian told L'Equipe. ""I just remind you that the transfer window is closed, that a season is underway. ""There are matches and Real Madrid cannot continue to behave in this way. Let it stop! Kylian is a player of Paris St Germain and the club wants this relationship to last."" Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar form what is regarded as the most exciting attacking trio in club football, but they have struggled to gel, with Mbappe showing his frustration towards the Brazilian. Mbappe was heard saying ""this bum, he never passes to me"" in a Ligue 1 game against Montpellier last month. ""Yes, yes, I said that. Now, these are things that happen all the time in soccer. It's just not something that sticks. That's why, immediately afterwards, seeing how big it had become, I talked to him about it,"" said Mbappe. ""We've exchanged a lot of words like that in the past and we'll continue to do so, because we want to win, but there shouldn't be any hard feelings. There is no resentment at all because I respect the player and the man and I admire what he is."" Mbappe now wants to focus on football. ""Right now, my future is not my priority,"" he said. ""I've already wasted a lot of energy this summer, and it was tiring."" Mbappe is with the France squad as they prepare for this week's Nations League Final Four tournament with a semi-final against Belgium on Thursday and the PSG forward is looking to put his Euro 2020 disappointment behind him. His miss in the penalty shootout against Switzerland effectively knocked the world champions out in the last 16 and Mbappe faced stern criticism in France as well as racist abuse. ""What shocked me, once again, was to be called a monkey for a penalty,"" he said. ""That's why I wanted support, not because I took my penalty on the left and (Yann) Sommer stopped it. That's my fault."" Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Romanian soccer players team up to cheer a dog's life," BUCHAREST, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Before they kick a ball to start matches this season, soccer players in Romania's top tier are carrying stray dogs onto the pitch as part of an initiative to find homes for abandoned animals. The campaign -- dubbed ""Fill The Gap in Your Life"" -- also aims to highlight the problem of unwanted dogs in the southeastern European nation, where shelters are filled to capacity and strays have long roamed the streets. ""We are hoping to motivate the people that might see the dogs brought by the players in their arms and so they would adopt them,"" said Anca Floarea, a counsellor at a local animal protection office. ""Until now, from the 18 dogs presented at the matches three were adopted and three more were inquired about, we are hoping the adoption will go through with those too."" International adoptions are possible but the country's football federation -- in partnership with local kennels -- is mainly focused on Romania for the campaign that will feature six dogs at every match until the season ends. At Academica Clinceni's recent game against FC Botosani, players walked on to the pitch holding the pups adorned with a nametag and scarf which makes it easier for people to identify them on shelter websites. Aside from the off-pitch success, the campaign has spurred players like Academica defender Marcel Holzmann to consider adopting. ""I have two cats, that is the problem I think, if I take one dog, but I want to,"" he said. ""It's very good, unbelievable that people like them they help the animals.""

The ATP also said it had received the report of an independent review it commissioned earlier in 2021 covering topics including the prevention, reporting and investigation of abuse as well as disciplinary measures. Reuters has not seen the report. ""As an organisation we recognise the need to be doing more to ensure everyone involved in professional tennis feels safe and protected,"" the ATP's Calvelli said.

Hamilton's Mission 44 and the educational charity Teach First will work together over the next two years to help schools serving disadvantaged communities in England. The Mercedes driver set up a commission last year to help  boost the number of Black people in British motorsport and promote diversity.

Raducanu, an 18-year-old from Great Britain, stunned the tennis world while emerging from relative obscurity to win the major in New York last month. She arrived at the U.S. Open ranked 150th in the world and needed to get through qualifying just to reach the main draw. Currently ranked 22nd in the world, Raducanu will be the No. 17 seed in Indian Wells. As one of the top 32 seeds, she will receive a first-round bye in the 96-player event. Raducanu has not played since beating Canada's Leylah Fernandez in the U.S. Open final, withdrawing from the subsequent Chicago Fall Tennis Classic. Her opening opponent in the Southern California desert will be the winner of a first-round match between Colombia's Maria Camila Osorio Serrano, a 19-year-old ranked 71st in the world, and Belarus' Aliaksandra Sasnovich, a 27-year-old ranked 100th. Raducanu parted with coach Andrew Richardson after her U.S. Open success. She announced Sunday that former British tennis star Jeremy Bates would be her temporary coach at Indian Wells. Halep, a 30-year-old Romanian who is ranked 17th, lost in the fourth round at the U.S. Open to fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine. Days later, Halep married boyfriend Toni Iuruc in her hometown of Constanta, Romania. Halep, who won the French Open in 2018 and Wimbledon in 2019, will open in Indian Wells against either Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk or China's Shuai Zhang. Fernandez, a 19-year-old who is now ranked 28th, will open in the desert against either France's Alize Cornet or a qualifier.

Norris was the youngest British driver in Formula One history when he debuted as a 19-year-old in 2019 but, now 21, has become a fan favourite as well as an outstanding talent on track. He has been on the podium four times this season, nearly taking his first win at last month's Russian Grand Prix after starting from pole position, and is fourth overall.

""Feeling like, I don't know what's next, if this goes wrong, if I don't go out in the next session and perform, what's going to happen, what's the outcome of all of this? Am I going to be in Formula One next year? ""If I'm not, what am I going to do? Because I'm not really good at many other things in life. ""So just all of that, and then just feeling depressed a lot of the time that if I have a bad weekend I just think, I'm not good enough and things like that."" Norris said social media had added to the pressure but working with the team and mental health charity Mind, partnered by McLaren, had helped him through. ""I'm in a much better place now.

The America's Cup has always been defined as a design-driven event, with the fastest boat emerging as the winner, and in recent editions it has reached new levels of technical sophistication and speed with craft which ""fly"" above the water on hydrofoils. ""The boat wasn't good enough,"" Radcliffe said of the British team's attempt to win the America's Cup in Auckland in 2021, adding that the team would also be putting together some of the best sailors under the command of veteran sailor Ainslie. ""We've brought in some fresh new talent,"" Ainslie said of his new-look team, which will include British sailor Giles Scott, who won gold in the Finn class at the Tokyo Olympics.

""This will undoubtedly and clearly increase the risk of the import and spread of COVID-19,"" Huang said. Tickets for the Beijing Winter Olympics will be sold to spectators from mainland China only, while unvaccinated athletes must spend 21 days in quarantine ahead of the Games, the International Olympic Committee said last week. The Games start on Feb. 4 and the Chinese capital will become the first city to have hosted both summer and winter Olympics after also staging the 2008 summer Games.

sports,Koulibaly says Fiorentina fans racially abused him," NAPLES, Italy, Oct 4 (Reuters) -  (Note offensive language in paragraph four) Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly said that he was racially abused by a section of Fiorentina supporters following their Serie A match on Sunday. Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported that Victor Osimhen and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa were also targeted after their defeat by Napoli. Alongside a photograph of himself pointing into the crowd, Koulibaly said he had heard the abuse from the stands and called for action. ""'Fucking monkey' - that's what they called me,"" Koulibaly said on his Twitter and Instagram accounts. ""These subjects have nothing to do with sport. ""They must be identified and kept out of the stadiums: forever. #NoToRacism."" Nigerian striker Osimhen released a statement via social media, which was retweeted by the official Napoli team account. ""Speak to your kids, your parents, make them understand how disgusting it is to hate an individual because of the colour of their skin,"" wrote the Nigeria international. NOTORACISM."" Fiorentina condemned the incident on Monday. ""Fiorentina expresses the most firm and harsh condemnation for the episodes of racism that took place yesterday during the match against Napoli,"" the Serie A club said in a statement. ""General Manager (Joe) Barone, already after the match, personally apologised. ""La Viola (Fiorentina) has already made available to the police all the video images and all the tools in its possession so that the culprits of these unspeakable chants are identified. ""Once the responsible institutions have identified the culprits, it will be the care of Fiorentina itself to prohibit them from accessing the stadium, hoping the same commitment from all the clubs, as well as the application of the rules that must always be the same for everyone."" Florence's mayor also released a statement on Monday. ""On behalf of Florence, I apologise,"" Dario Nardella said on Twitter. ""Whoever yesterday offended the players of the Napoli at the stadium does not represent the city and does not represent Fiorentina."" The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) have opened an investigation into the incident. ""The Federal Prosecutor's Office, having acquired the reports of its inspectors and having listened to the player, has opened an investigation,"" FIGC said in a statement. ""In the next few hours, further investigation will be carried out by acquiring the relevant documents from the Florence Police Headquarters."" Italian football has been plagued by racism. Last month, prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged racist chants by Lazio supporters directed at AC Milan midfielders Tiemoue Bakayoko and Franck Kessie, while Juventus were forced into issuing an apology after their women's team account tweeted a picture containing a racist gesture in August. Napoli came from behind to earn a 2-1 victory in Florence, maintaining their 100% win record at the start of the Serie A season to sit top of the standings.

The Yankees will face the Boston Red Sox on the road at Fenway Park Tuesday in a one-game wild-card matchup after Boston's 7-5 comeback victory against the Washington Nationals. Boston will host after winning the regular-season series with the Yankees, 10-9. Rougned Odor opened the ninth by flaring a single off Josh Fleming (10-8) into center field. Pinch runner Tyler Wade tagged up on a warning track flyball by Gleyber Torres. Wade was held up at third when Anthony Rizzo lined a single into right field past shifting second baseman Brandon Lowe and Fleming was replaced by Andrew Kittredge. Judge won it when he lined a single that was deflected by Kittredge to Lowe. Lowe made a diving stop and Wade beat the throw home with a headfirst slide. Red Sox 7, Nationals 5 Rafael Devers' second homer of the game, a two-run shot in the ninth inning, lifted visiting Boston to a win over Washington and the top wild-card playoff spot in the American League. The Red Sox rallied from a 5-1 deficit to finish the series sweep. Kyle Schwarber reached on an error to open the ninth for the Red Sox on Sunday. Xander Bogaerts struck out, but Devers connected with a 2-1 pitch from Kyle Finnegan (5-9) for his 38th home run of the season, a shot to center. Ryan Zimmerman, who hasn't said if he will return next season, was 0-for-3 with an RBI walk for Washington before being removed to an ovation in the eighth inning, and catcher Alex Avila had a two-run double in his final major league game. Braves 5, Mets 0 Atlanta's Jorge Soler led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run and six pitchers combined to limit visiting New York to three hits in the win to conclude the regular season. Soler lined the second pitch from New York starter Noah Syndergaard into the left field stands for his 27th homer. It was his 14th since joining the Braves, his fourth in 11 games as the leadoff hitter and his second to start a game. Reliever Spencer Strider (1-0), a hard-throwing rookie who made his major league debut on Friday, got the win. The NL East-winning Braves will open the Division Series at Milwaukee on Friday. The loss went to Noah Syndergaard (0-1), who pitched an inning in his second start since elbow surgery. He allowed two runs on three hits. Astros 7, Athletics 6 Yuli Gurriel delivered a walk-off single in the ninth inning and Houston claimed a victory in the rubber match of its three-game series with visiting Oakland. Kyle Tucker smacked a two-run, go-ahead homer with two outs in the sixth inning that gave the Astros a 4-3 lead.

Gurriel finished the season batting .319 to claim the American League batting crown. Oakland's Seth Brown keyed a three-run rally in the ninth when he drilled his second home run of the game and 20th of the season off Astros right-hander Zack Greinke, making his first relief appearance since Aug. 20, 2007. Giants 11, Padres 4 San Francisco put on a performance worth celebrating, riding the arm and bat of right-hander Logan Webb to a shellacking of visiting San Diego to wrap up the National League West crown. With a franchise-record and major-league-leading 107 wins, the Giants earned the home-field advantage through the NL playoffs, which for them will begin at home on Friday in Game 1 of the NL Division Series against the winner of Wednesday's NL wild-card game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. Webb (11-3) ran his unbeaten streak to 20 straight starts, limiting the Padres to four runs and six hits in seven-plus innings. He struck out eight and did not issue a walk. At the plate, he knocked out his first career home run and hit a one-out single in a two-run third inning that opened the scoring. Cubs 3, Cardinals 2 (7 innings) Matt Duffy drove in two runs as visiting Chicago edged St. Louis in seven innings in a rain-shortened game. Frank Schwindel went 2-for-3 with an RBI and two runs scored for the Cubs, who closed their season by winning four of their last five games. Cubs starting pitcher Alec Mills allowed two runs on four hits and two walks in four innings. The Cardinals lost three of their last five games after clinching a National League wild-card playoff berth with their 17-game winning streak. Cardinals starting pitcher Jake Woodford (3-4) allowed three runs on six hits in five innings. Blue Jays 12, Orioles 4 George Springer hit a grand slam and a solo home run and Toronto completed a three-game sweep of visiting Baltimore but fell one game shy in its American League wild-card pursuit. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a two-run home run for the Blue Jays, giving him 48 for the season. It gives him the most home runs for a player 22 or younger, surpassing the 47 by Eddie Mathews of the Milwaukee Braves in 1953. Guerrero also tied for the American League lead in home runs with Kansas City's Salvador Perez, and it was his 12th of the season against Baltimore. Marcus Semien added his 45th homer of the season for Toronto, which was eliminated when the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees each won their games to claim the AL wild-card spots. Marlins 5, Phillies 4 Rookie Nick Fortes gave Miami the lead with a two-run homer in the fourth inning en route to a season-ending victory over visiting Philadelphia. Philadelphia finished second in the NL East, and Miami was fourth place. Reliever Hector Neris (4-7) took the loss, allowing two runs in 1 2/3 innings. Zach Thompson (3-7) earned the win with one scoreless inning in relief. Andrew McCutchen hit a two-run homer and Freddy Galvis added a solo shot for Philadelphia. Reds 6, Pirates 3 Joey Votto hit a three-run homer and Aristides Aquino also homered and drove in two runs as Cincinnati defeated host Pittsburgh. Nick Castellanos added an RBI double for the Reds. He finished with 100 RBIs for the season, and Votto ended with 99. Cincinnati's Reiver Sanmartin (2-0) -- in his second major league start, both in less than a week and both against Pittsburgh -- pitched six innings. He allowed one run and seven hits, with six strikeouts and one walk. Oneil Cruz homered for the Pirates, who won the first two games of the series and finished as the only team in the majors without a sweep of an opponent. Cody Ponce (0-6), the second Pittsburgh pitcher, got rocked for four runs and six hits in 1 1/3 innings. Indians 6, Rangers 0 Aaron Civale tossed six strong innings and Yu Chang hit a two-run homer as visiting Cleveland won its final game as the Indians. Bradley Zimmer had two hits and an RBI for the Indians, who have gone by that nickname since 1915 but will be known as the Guardians starting in 2022. Civale (12-5) yielded just three singles, walked one and struck out four to help Cleveland finish its first losing season since 2012 by taking two of three at Texas. Diamondbacks 5, Rockies 4 Josh VanMeter hit a walk-off home run and Arizona came back to beat visiting Colorado in the rubber match of a three-game, season-ending series in Phoenix. VanMeter hit a two-out blast to right field off Carlos Estevez (3-5) as Arizona avoided matching the worst record in franchise history. J.B. Wendelken (4-3) pitched a scoreless ninth inning for the D-backs, who rallied from an early four-run deficit to finish at 52-110. The 2004 team went 51-111. Tigers 5, White Sox 2 Daz Cameron hit a go-ahead, solo home run in the ninth inning, and Willi Castro had three hits as visiting Detroit topped American League Central champion Chicago in the teams' regular-season finale. Cameron connected against White Sox reliever Reynaldo Lopez (4-4) to open the ninth before Dustin Garneau and Akil Baddoo drove home insurance runs with a double and sacrifice fly, respectively. Michael Fulmer pitched around a hit in a driving rain in the ninth for his 14th save. Joe Jimenez (6-1) was the winner, striking out two and walking one in a scoreless eighth. Twins 7, Royals 3 Jorge Polanco hit a three-run home run to highlight a five-run first inning and Minnesota went on to defeat host Kansas City. It was the 33rd home run of the season for Polanco, extending his club single-season record for a switch-hitter. Byron Buxton also homered and doubled and Luis Arraez went 3-for-4 with two runs for Minnesota, which finished in last place in the AL Central, one game behind fourth-place Kansas City. Nick Vincent (1-0) picked up the win with two hitless innings of relief, while Jorge Alcala earned his first major league save. Carlos Santana went 3-for-4 with an RBI and Michael A. Taylor added two hits and an RBI for Kansas City. Jackson Kowar (0-6) took the loss, allowing five runs on five hits over four innings while striking out six. Dodgers 10, Brewers 3 Trea Turner hit a grand slam and host Los Angeles finished the regular season with a victory over Milwaukee. The Dodgers, however, were unable to run down the San Francisco Giants for the National League West title. The Dodgers (106-56), who tied the franchise record for victories in a season, won their last seven games and their last 15 at home, but fell one game short in their quest for a ninth consecutive division title. Los Angeles will play host to the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL wild-card game on Wednesday. L.A. also lost first baseman Max Muncy to a left elbow injury in the third inning. Muncy collided near the bag at first with the Brewers' Jace Peterson while reaching to catch a throw. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters it's ""very unlikely"" Muncy will play on Wednesday. Angels 7, Mariners 3 Shohei Ohtani led off the game with a home run and Jared Walsh added a two-run shot as Los Angeles defeated host Seattle, thwarting the Mariners' bid for their first postseason appearance since 2001. The Mariners had a chance to force their way into a playoff for the American League's second and final wild-card berth but needed to beat the Angels and have either Boston or the New York Yankees lose. None of those happened. After the Red Sox's victory in Washington was completed, clinching the Mariners' fate, Seattle manager Scott Servais pulled veteran third baseman Kyle Seager off the field with one out in the ninth inning to a standing ovation from the sellout crowd. Despite 35 homers and 101 RBIs this season, the Mariners aren't expected to pick up the option on Seager's contract. --Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Domenicali says a third of F1 races could be sprint format," LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Formula One will have a record 23 races next year and a third of them could be in the sprint format trialled this year, the sport's chief executive Stefano Domenicali said on Monday. The format has been used at Silverstone and Monza this year, with Brazil's Interlagos to come, and features qualifying on Friday for a Saturday 100km race that then decides the starting grid for Sunday. Points are awarded for the top three drivers, in a 3-2-1 system. Domenicali told Sky Sports television that the 2022 season would run from mid-March to mid-November, likely to be the earliest finish in a decade, with the calendar due to be published later this month. ""We said at the beginning of the year there would be three tests this year to make sure we have the right plan for the future. The vast majority of the comments we received were super positive,"" he said of the sprint format. ""Promoters are super happy because there is something new and important on Friday and Saturday and Sunday...generally speaking it has been an incredible success. ""It is something we want to keep for a third of the races, more or less, and to connect with a certain different way of giving rewards and points and to connect with specific circuits,"" added the Italian. Asked whether that could mean seven or eight sprints, he said it was a possibility. This year is set to feature 22 rounds, still a record, and ends in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 12. There will be new races in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with Miami coming in from 2022 and Qatar dropping off before starting a 10-year deal in 2023. Domenicali said Qatar would be a night race, with the venue from 2023 to be decided. He countered criticism from human rights campaigners of the sport's embrace of the Middle East, now with four races, saying it could be force for good. ""Sport will help to enhance the positivity and the right values in each country that we are going to because the spotlight of Formula One is so big you cannot hide,"" said the former Ferrari boss.

The Spaniard, a former world number one, was down a set and a break but fought back strongly to beat Jabeur 3-6 6-3 6-0 to claim her second title of the year and ninth overall. The victory helped Muguruza climb two spots to number six on the Race to the WTA Finals leaderboard and three places on the women's rankings. ""Making finals is so hard,"" the 27-year-old, who has contested four finals this year, told the WTA. ""I've been around for quite some time now and I know that winning titles is something very difficult. ""To have the opportunity to win four and I won two, is already a great sign because that's something that you can touch. You can prove hey, we're doing a great job. Here's a trophy, we're doing good."" Muguruza is aiming to qualify for her first WTA Finals since 2017, having played the event three times from 2015 when it was held in Singapore. Defending champion and top-ranked Ash Barty, world number two Aryna Sabalenka, world number three Karolina Pliskova and French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova have all qualified for next month's tournament. Big-serving Czech Pliskova was the latest to secure her spot in Guadalajara on Monday, having reached the finals of the WTA 1000 events in Rome and Montreal and Wimbledon in July. The Finals, contested by the world's top eight singles players and eight doubles teams, was moved out of China's Shenzhen after last year's event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will be held in Guadalajara, Mexico. ""I know it's going to be very nice over there because Latin people are fire,"" the Venezuelan-born said. ""I think the girls are going to enjoy it.""

Four birdies on the front nine helped Willett to finish with a four-under 68 and 18-under for the tournament, two better than Swede Lagergren and compatriot Hatton, both of whom faded towards the end as Willett made eight successive pars to seal victory. Hatton, who led at the halfway stage, birdied his last hole to end with a five-under 67 for the round, while Lagergren fired five birdies on the front nine en route to a six-under 66. ""It's magical, on British soil with everyone here. It's been a great week. It's been a couple of years of average stuff again. I seem to do this a lot actually, go up and down,"" said an emotional Willett who is set to move back into the top 100 in the world rankings. ""We've been working hard, people don't see it behind the scenes. Obviously my wife does and other people do but it's a good one.""

sports,Argentina to probe attendance numbers after Buenos Aires derby," BUENOS AIRES, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Argentina plans to investigate attendance numbers at Sunday's derby between River Plate and Boca Juniors, a judicial official said, after local media questioned whether numbers exceeded those permitted under COVID-19 rules governing fans' return. Supporters were allowed back into stadiums in Argentina on Friday after 18 months of empty arenas due to the coronavirus pandemic. Only those who had received at least one dose of the vaccine were permitted to attend games and the maximum capacity was limited to 50%. However, Argentine media questioned the numbers present inside River Plate's Monumental stadium and a judicial official told Reuters an investigation would be launched. ""People were detained for the sale of false tickets ... and the Public Ministry of Buenos Aires city is going to investigate whether the capacity was exceeded,"" a spokesperson for the office in charge of major events said. La Nacion, one of Argentina's best-selling newspapers, put the attendance at 54,000 to 57,600. Sports newspaper Ole estimated there were 52,000 to 53,000 fans, saying that was ""a count clearly more"" than half the 72,000 capacity. ""After seeing the images on TV and according to eyewitnesses, questions are inevitable,"" Ole wrote online. A River Plate representative did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The home side won the match 2-1 thanks to a first-half brace from Julian Alvarez. They were assisted by a red card shown to Boca's Marcos Rojo after just 16 minutes. The result leaves River Plate top of the league, a point ahead of Talleres de Cordoba, who have a game in hand.

sports,We played without fear says Son after sparking Tottenham win," LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's inspirational Son Heung-min said the key to their much-needed 2-1 Premier League home win over Aston Villa on Sunday was that they ""played without fear"". Three successive league defeats, in which they shipped a combined nine goals and scored once, had left Spurs in freefall and an in-form Villa side looked prime to take advantage. But with South Korea forward Son producing a relentless display, setting up his side's two goals, Tottenham looked energised as they emerged from their September slump. ""This win brings us a lot of good energy and the way we played today was different,"" he said. ""We needed that especially before the international break. It is a good feeling to win this game and go away. ""We played different to a couple of weeks ago. We played without fear and we enjoyed it even when we lost the ball. The last three games were defeats we did not want and the confidence went down but we can bounce back and go back up."" The result left Spurs eighth in the standings with 12 points, four behind leaders Chelsea after seven games, while Villa are two behind in 10th. The hosts took a first-half lead through Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg but when Villa striker Ollie Watkins equalised with just over 20 minutes remaining it looked dangerous for a Tottenham side whose confidence has been fragile. But Son's superb run soon after saw Matt Targett score an own goal and Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo could breathe a sight of relief after coming under pressure. Son said the key was that Spurs continue in the same mindset after the international break. ""Everyone is experienced, everyone wants to win and take responsibility. We have to keep this mindset. When we win it is not everything, it is a long season and we start on zero again for the next game,"" he added. Tottenham had managed only 57 goal attempts in their previous six games -- scoring four goals. But with Son running Villa's defence ragged the home side were far more threatening on Sunday. ""I honestly believe there were more goals there for us today, but the production and the way we produced, the way we created was much, much better,"" Espirito Santo said.

The city-based championship, whose biggest shareholder is telecoms group Liberty Global, said that for the first time most  viewers (62%) were watching races live by the end of the season rather than as highlights or repeats. Formula E said its cumulative audience rose to 316 million, despite a shortened season and the lack of races in Asia due to COVID-19. Season seven, running from February to August 2021, was the  first as a full FIA-sanctioned world championship and had 15 rounds with Dutch driver Nyck de Vries winning the title for Mercedes at the final race in Berlin. The heavily-disrupted sixth season ran from November 2019 to August 2020 and had 11 races, six of them held in the space of nine days at Berlin's old Tempelhof airport to complete the calendar.

sports,Italian Colbrelli wins epic Paris-Roubaix classic," ROUBAIX, France, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Sonny Colbrelli became the first Italian to win the Paris-Roubaix Monument classic in 22 years when he prevailed on his debut in a three-man sprint finish at the end of a gruelling race on Sunday. His whole body caked in mud after 257.7 kilometres featuring 30 cobbled sectors, Colbrelli burst into tears as he collapsed on the grass of the Roubaix Velodrome after triumphing in the first rain-hit edition of the Hell of the North since 2002. The European champion, of Team Bahrain Victorious, pipped Belgian Florian Vermeersch (Lotto Soudal) and Dutchman Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Fenix), who were second and third respectively. Van der Poel, one of the pre-race favourites, came up just short after doing most of the work in a small group chasing Italian Gianni Moscon, who seemed to be heading to victory before a puncture and late crash ruined his chances. Moscon (Ineos-Grenadiers) eventually finished fourth, 44 seconds off the pace, leaving his compatriot Colbrelli to become the first Italian to win here since Andrea Taffi in 1999. ""Today is a legendary Roubaix with the rain and the weather at the start and an attack with 90km to go after Arenberg,"" said Colbrelli. ""I followed only Van der Poel in the finale and in the end I had a super sprint. I was at the limit in the finale. It was super difficult because I had to pay attention for the crashes from the first sectors and then there?�s always the stress to be in position on the cobbles. This year is my year, I?�m very happy."" Van der Poel, who was also making his debut on the Paris-Roubaix in the first edition since April 2019 after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted organisers to put off the event, matched his father Adrie's podium finish from 1986. Countless crashes marred the race with triple world champion Peter Sagan hitting the deck and Swiss Stefan Kueng going down three times. MOSCON'S NIGHTMARE Colbrelli spent most of the day tucked into Van der Poel's slipstream and when the final sprint on the Velodrome loomed, the Italian was the freshest man. It long seemed, however, that Moscon would be celebrating a solo win. Moscon pulled away from a leading group in the cobbled sector of Auchy-lez-Orchies to Bersee 49km from the line as the sun pierced through the clouds and the roads started to dry. Entering the key cobbled sector of Mons-en-Pevele, Moscon led Vermeersch and fellow Belgian Tom Van Asbroeck by 35 seconds and Van der Poel, Canada's Guillaume Boivin and Colbrelli by 1:10. Powering his way through the thick mud, Moscon extended his advantage over the Van der Poel trio to 1:25 as Belgian Wout van Aert faded away. With 38km remaining, Vermeersch and Van Asbroeck were reined in by Van der Poel and company and the newly formed group organised the chase behind Moscon. The Italian lost some 30 seconds with a flat rear tyre that prompted a bike change 29km from the line with the chasing quintet reducing the gap to 45 seconds. It fell to 15 seconds after he crashed on a muddy patch but the Italian stayed just clear as Boivin crashed in the group of chasers in the cobbled sector of Camphin en Pevele. He was however caught and dropped 16km from the finish in the Carrefour de l'Arbre as Colbrelli, Van der Poel and Vermeersch went clear to contest the final sprint.

Evans secured his fifth career win by finishing 14.1 seconds ahead of Hyundai's Estonian Ott Tanak, the 2019 world champion who had been chasing his third successive win in the gravel event. Ireland's Craig Breen, the leader after the first leg, was third for Hyundai with Finnish driver Esapekka Lappi fourth in a privately-entered Toyota and Ogier, who had been 44 points clear, fifth in the fastest round on the calendar. ""It feels pretty special to win for the team on its home rally,"" said Evans, now the only driver who can deny Ogier an eighth championship with a maximum 60 points left to be won. ""It?�s a positive result in terms of the championship. The drivers??title is still a long shot for me but we?�ll keep giving our best on every event."" Evans took five stage wins in a row on Friday and Saturday on the high-speed gravel roads around Jyvaskyla, where the Toyota rally team are based, to move from fifth to first. He gained five bonus points for winning the final Power Stage, ahead of Tanak and Lappi. Toyota's Takamoto Katsuta took two extra points and Breen one while Ogier failed to add to his tally. The Frenchman had been given a one-minute penalty and fined 800 euros ($930) on Saturday for not fastening his helmet strap correctly. ""Today for us was all about trying to get some more points in the Power Stage.

sports,Yankees and Red Sox set to renew rivalry in wildcard clash," TORONTO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox scored dramatic late inning wins to bring the Major League Baseball regular season to an enthralling end on Sunday, setting up a wildcard showdown between the long-time rivals. The final day of a 162-game, six-month marathon began with four teams -- the Yankees, Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners -- all in contention for two American League wildcards and when the dust settled it was two of baseball's most storied clubs still standing. The Yankees left it about as late as they possibly could to clinch their place as Aaron Judge swatted a walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth for a 1-0 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. ""It?�s been a crazy, wild year,"" said New York manager Aaron Boone after the Yankees reached the postseason for the 23rd time in 27 years. ""Fitting that it would come down to the last day to get in. ""We?�re ready to take our shot."" It was also a nailbiter in the U.S. capitol, where the Red Sox were trailing the Washington Nationals 5-1 after five innings then rallied for six unanswered runs. Rafael Devers broke open a 5-5 tie in the top of the ninth with his second homer of the day, a one-out, two-run shot to deep centre field. The Red Sox will now host the Yankees in the wildcard game on Tuesday at Fenway Park with the winner moving on to the Divisional Series against the AL East champion Rays. Toronto and Seattle went into the day needing a win combined with a New York or Boston loss to force a tiebreaker and extend  their seasons. The Blue Jays did what they had to do, hammering the Baltimore Orioles 12-4 while the Mariners season finished with a disappointing 7-3 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. Angels Shohei Ohtani, the hot favourite for American League most valuable player honours, launched a leadoff homer, his 46th of the season, to put the Mariners in a hole they would never climb out of. After slamming five home runs in a 10-1 rout of the Orioles on Saturday, the Blue Jays' bats were booming again on Sunday banging out four homers, including a third inning grand slam from George Springer and a two-run shot from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. for his 48th of season. Over in the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, Major League Baseball's two top teams, started play with top spot in the West division up for grabs. Both Los Angeles and San Francisco would finish the campaign with impressive wins -- the Giants beating the San Diego Padres 11-4 while the Dodgers thumped Milwaukee 10-3. But top spot in the West goes to the Giants with a record of 106-55 while the 105-56 Dodgers settled for an NL wildcard and a Wednesday meeting with the St. Louis Cardinals.

Stokes was not included in England's 15-man preliminary squad as he extends his break from cricket to focus on his mental health, while Archer ruled himself out after he suffered a recurrence of a stress fracture in his right elbow. Coach Chris Silverwood named batter Liam Livingstone and fast bowler Tymal Mills as the replacements in the England squad for the World Cup, which will be held in the United Arab Emirates and Oman from Oct. 17.

sports,Manchester City fight back twice in thrilling 2-2 draw at Liverpool," LIVERPOOL, England, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Manchester City came from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw with Liverpool in a breathless and pulsating Premier League encounter at Anfield on Sunday. All four goals came in a second half packed with the high-quality, high-tempo, end-to-end football that makes the Premier League so popular globally. Sadio Mane had put Liverpool ahead before Phil Foden equalised only for Mohamed Salah to restore the home side's advantage with a wonderful solo goal. But Kevin De Bruyne's 81st-minute equaliser ensured the teams shared the points and left Liverpool in second place on 15 points, one behind leaders Chelsea. Pep Guardiola's City are in third spot on 14 points, level with Manchester United, Everton and Brighton & Hove Albion. ""What a game. That's the reason (over) the last years Man City and Liverpool are always there because we try to play in this way. Unfortunately we couldn't win -- but we didn't lose,"" said the Spaniard. ""That's why the Premier League is the best. It was great, really great."" City will look back with regret on their failure not to make more of their first-half domination when the visitors toyed with Juergen Klopp's side for the 20 minutes before the interval. James Milner, filling in for Trent Alexander Arnold at right-back, had a torrid half, faced with Phil Foden and Jack Grealish and receiving little help from his team mates. A remarkable piece of mazy dribbling from Bernardo Silva created a chance for Foden in the 21st minute but his shot was straight at Alisson who parried the ball. City felt they should have had a penalty when Milner appeared to push Foden in the back but the appeal was waved away by referee Paul Tierney -- the first of a series of decisions which infuriated Guardiola. Foden was causing Liverpool constant problems and De Bruyne should have found the target with a diving header from his cross to the back post. DETERMINED REDS Somehow Liverpool survived to the break without conceding and they came out for the second half determined to shift the momentum in the game. They did just that when they grabbed the lead in the 59th minute as Salah skipped away from Joao Cancelo and threaded the ball into the path of the sprinting Mane who confidently fired past goalkeeper Ederson. But City were level 10 minutes later when Gabriel Jesus cut in from the right, taking four Liverpool defenders out of the game, before finding Foden who drilled the ball into the far, bottom corner of the net. Neither side were in the mood to settle for a point with the home fans roaring on their team and City sensing there were more opportunities to come. The goal that restored Liverpool's lead was one of rare quality -- Salah twisting and turning into the box to lose Cancelo and Aymeric Laporte before firing home for the seventh straight game in all competitions, the Egyptian showing the deft touch, sharp movement and clinical finishing that have made him such a crowd favourite. Butonce more City responded, the influential Foden again finding space on the left but, this time, cleverly pulling the ball back to the edge of the boxfor Kevin De Bruyne whose curling shot took a slight deflection off Joel Matip and beat Alisson. There was still time for an outstanding piece of defending from City midfielder Rodri, whose superb block kept out a goal-bound effort from Fabinho after Ederson had dropped a cross. Klopp made no attempt to sugar-coat his team's first-half display. ""We were too passive with and without the ball and played right into City's hands. That was the worst half we have played against them,"" he said. ""I was more than pleased when I heard the whistle for halftime because we had to adjust a lot of things and we did. ""Second half was completely different. If we only played the second half I would have loved to have won but with the first half I am happy with the point,"" he said.

sports,Flamengo overrun Athletico to go second in Brazil," RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Flamengo's Bruno Henrique scored his fifth goal in four games as they overran Athletico Paranaense 3-0 with a commanding first-half performance in Sunday's Serie A clash in Brazil. The former Wolfsburg and Santos striker scored a brace in each of Flamengo's two Copa Libertadores semi-final legs last month and hit the target again with a stooped header after 10 minutes at home to Athletico. By that time Flamengo were already a goal up through Everton Ribeiro, who bundled home from close range after five minutes. Andreas Pereira, on loan from Manchester United, scored the third on the stroke of halftime after a lightning counter attack. The result lifts Flamengo into second place in Serie A on goal difference with 38 points from 20 matches, above Palmeiras, who have played a game more and host Juventude later on Sunday.

Repsol Honda's Marquez, who was third on the grid, made an impressive start as he charged through the first turn to grab the lead ahead of pole sitter Francesco Bagnaia and Quartararo, eventually opening a gap of more than four seconds with five laps to go. ""The plan was exactly how the race went. Start fast, a bit slow in the first laps and then increase the gap when the level around me drops,"" said Marquez after his second win of the season. ""I was comfortable but it was difficult to concentrate in the end. But I also knew that Fabio was far and locked down because of the championship race. So everybody is happy today."" Quartararo said that second place tasted even sweeter than victory. ""Physically, it was difficult. But good to see the result and also the American fans. I have gained an advantage in the championship, so I'm happy,"" said the Frenchman. Quartararo leads Italian Bagnaia by 52 points with three rounds to go and can clinch the title at Misano in three weeks' time. Ducati's Bagnaia struggled after his poor opening and slipped down to sixth before going past a fading Jorge Martin of Pramac Ducati with three laps remaining to salvage third place. Alex Rins of Suzuki Ecstar came fourth. Bagnaia said:""The track is very demanding. In this moment, I'm finished.

sports,Milan hang on to beat Atalanta and close gap with leaders Napoli," BERGAMO, Italy, Oct 3 (Reuters) - AC Milan continued their impressive start to the Serie A season on Sunday, surviving a late Atalanta comeback to earn a 3-2 away victory. Milan raced into an early lead, with captain Davide Calabria poking home the ball at the second attempt after just 28 seconds. The hosts piled on the pressure in search of an equaliser but could not make several chances count, and Atalanta's wastefulness proved costly as Sandro Tonali raced clear three minutes before the break to double Milan's advantage. Milan did not let up as Rafael Leao seemingly put the victory beyond all doubt with a third goal with 12 minutes to go. Duvan Zapata got Atalanta back into the contest from the penalty spot with four minutes left, before Mario Pasalic ensured a nervy finish for Milan in stoppage time with a second goal for the hosts but it proved too little, too late. A sixth victory from seven league games this season for second-placed Milan helped them to close the gap with leaders Napoli to two points, while Atalanta, who finished third behind Milan last term, are eighth after their first defeat in six matches in all competitions. ""After it went to 3-2 we were worried but it is over now,"" Tonali told DAZN. ""We had a great match. ""We went strong despite a bit of tiredness after the Champions League in midweek. Now let's continue like this. If you come to Bergamo and play a match like that it means that you are on the right path."" Milan were the away-day specialists last season, winning 16 of their 19 games on the road in Serie A, and maintaining their unbeaten away record this term became much more achievable in Bergamo following Calabria's early goal. Calabria's finish was the third-fastest Milan goal in Serie A since the 2004-05 season -- when such statistics were first gathered. Zapata and Ruslan Malinovskiy both should have done better from good positions for the home side as they chased a leveller, while goalkeeper Mike Maignan was again in fine form for Milan. The goal that gave Milan breathing space was avoidable, as Remo Freuler was caught in possession by Tonali who was able to stroke home his third of the season unopposed. Atalanta tailed off as the match wore on, with Alexis Saelemaekers missing a glorious chance to make it three midway through the second half before Leao hammered home his third goal of the season. Out of nowhere, Milan debutant Junior Messias was adjudged to have handled in the penalty area, giving Zapata the chance to unsettle Stefano Pioli's side, which he converted with aplomb. That bolt from the blue proved to be disruptive as substitute Pasalic was left unmarked to stroke home from close range but there was not enough time to complete the comeback. ""We did better than our opponents, we deservedly won against a strong team and on a difficult pitch,"" Pioli told reporters. ""We knew that Atalanta start strongly at home, but we started better than them with the goal from Calabria, it gave us greater conviction.""

West Ham's Dagny Brynjarsdottir broke the deadlock with a header six minutes before halftime and, though City's Ellen White had a goal ruled out for offside, the Hammers defended bravely before Yui Hasegawa added a second in stoppage time to seal the win.

Salah, who had created the first goal for Sadio Mane, restored Liverpool's lead, making it 2-1 after twisting away from Joao Cancelo, leaving Bernardo Silva on the floor and dribbling past Aymeric Laporte before a clinical right-foot finish. ""Only the best players in the world score goals like this.

""If Leo Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo score that goal then the world says yes because it's world class. He is one of the best players in the world, that's how it is,"" he said.

sports,Soccer-Son shines as Tottenham end streak with win over Villa," LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Harry Kane's Premier League goal drought continued but a virtuoso display by his strike partner Son Heung-min ensured Tottenham Hotspur's losing streak ended with a 2-1 home victory over Aston Villa on Sunday. South Korean Son did not add to his three league goals this season but produced a tireless display and his two assists ensured Tottenham will head into the international break with their tails up after a sticky patch. His clever pass set up Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for Tottenham's opener in the 27th minute and shortly after Villa had drawn level he again left a Villa defending trailing in his wake to deliver a cross that Matt Targett turned into his own net. Ollie Watkins celebrated his recall to the England squad with Villa's leveller -- his first league goal of the campaign. Tottenham are still clearly a work in progress under Nuno Espirito Santo, but the performance was a vast improvement on last weekend's 3-1 defeat at local rivals Arsenal -- a third successive loss in which they conceded three goals. Victory lifted Tottenham into eighth spot with 12 points while Villa, whose three-match unbeaten league run ended, slipped to 10th with 10 points. ""We needed a win but a well-deserved win. We did a good match against tough opponents. Important for us, the boys and the fans. We reacted well after conceding and positive in a lot of ways,"" Espirito Santo said. ""Many times we conceded and go flat but this time the team did well. We missed chances to kill the game."" There was a nervousness about Tottenham in the opening exchanges but Villa were not able to take advantage and the hosts grew in confidence. Kane was close to a spectacular opening goal with a quickly-taken free kick from the halfway line which had Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez back-pedalling to keep out. BOTTOM CORNER Son also fired over before he combined with Hojberg down the right and slid a pass across for the Dane to place a side-foot shot into the bottom corner. Villa began the second half well and Targett had a goalbound effort blocked by Cristian Romero, who impressed after being selected ahead of Davinson Sanchez. Son volleyed over from a cross by Emerson Royal and out-muscled Ezri Konsa down the left but had his effort from a narrow angle blocked by Martinez. Villa left back Targett was in the thick of the action and it was his low cross that allowed Watkins to nip in front of Eric Dier to score in the 67th minute. All eyes were on how a fragile Tottenham would react but thanks to Son they did so in style. Played in down the left by Sergio Reguilon he left Kortney Hause trailing before threading a low cross to Moura and Targett's desperate intervention sent the ball into the net. Kane, who scored a hat-trick against NS Mura in the Europa Conference League in midweek, had chances to kill the game off but was unusually hesitant and the England striker's six-game streak without a Premier League goal is his worst run since the 2015-16 campaign. ""I didn't think there was an awful lot in the match,"" Villa boss Dean Smith said. ""They had the outstanding player on the pitch in Son Heung-min, he set up the winner and caused us problems all game.""

The league leaders started sluggishly and were punished in the 28th minute as Lucas Martinez Quarta took advantage of some slack marking to fire Fiorentina into a deserved lead. The opener acted as a wake-up call for Napoli with Hirving Lozano firing them level 10 minutes later, following up after goalkeeper Bartlomiej Dragowski had brilliantly saved Lorenzo Insigne's penalty. Victor Osimhen then almost edged Napoli in front before halftime with a spectacular overhead kick. However, the visitors did not have to wait much longer to complete the turnaround, with Amir Rrahmani giving them a 2-1 lead in the 50th minute. Napoli had chances to extend their advantage but saw the game out to secure a seventh straight win and stay top, two points clear of second-placed AC Milan, who beat Atalanta 3-2. Fiorentina remain fifth after their third defeat of the season. It is only the second time in Napoli's history that they have won their opening seven matches of a Serie A campaign, but that was still not enough to please coach Luciano Spalletti. ""We still need to improve, to see out results after battling to be in front,"" he told DAZN. ""This (margin of) victory is small and there was a chance to do better. Some players are still not fully fit. Playing every three days is not easy. We still have a lot to do.""

sports,Ethiopia's Lemma secures maiden London Marathon victory," LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Ethiopia's Sisay Lemma won the men's London Marathon in a time of two hours, four minutes and one second after breaking away from the leading pack late in the race on Sunday. In cool and dry conditions, Lemma improved on his podium finish last year to surge ahead and seize victory, bouncing back after failing to finish the Olympic marathon in Japan. The 30-year-old crossed the line 27 seconds ahead of Kenya's Vincent Kipchumba, who took the runner-up spot for the second successive year, while his compatriot Mosinet Geremew finished third. Defending champion Shura Kitata, who pulled out of the Olympic marathon in Tokyo after suffering in the hot and humid conditions, finished sixth in the British capital in 2:07.51 after being hampered by an apparent hamstring niggle. Kenyan great Eliud Kipchoge, winner of four of the previous five London Marathons before 2020, was absent from this year's event, with Britain's Mo Farah also missing after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games and suffering a stress fracture in his foot. The marathon, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in April, returned to its traditional route from Blackheath to The Mall for the first time in over two years. More than 36,000 competitors joined some of the world's best in the mass participation event and up to 40,000 joined in virtually, organisers said. Only elite races took place on the course around St James's Park last year, with amateurs last competing in 2019. Earlier, Kenya's Joyciline Jepkosgei emerged victorious in the women's race on her London debut with a time of 2:17.43, upsetting twice winner and compatriot Brigid Kosgei.

sports,Bayern suffer first home loss to Frankfurt in 21 years," MUNICH, Germany, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Bayern Munich suffered their first defeat of the season and their first Bundesliga home loss to Eintracht Frankfurt in 21 years when Filip Kostic drilled home an 83rd-minute goal to earn the visitors a shock 2-1 victory on Sunday. Kostic picked up the ball on the edge of the box, charged forward and beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a powerful low drive to seal Eintracht's first win of the season and snap Bayern's nine-game winning run in all competitions. The Bavarians had only themselves to blame for not killing off the game earlier with a string of golden chances but remain top of the table with 16 points, ahead on goal difference of Bayer Leverkusen, who crushed Arminia Bielefeld 4-0 with two goals from Czech striker Patrik Schick. Borussia Dortmund and Freiburg are a point behind in third and fourth respectively. ""Defeats always hurt,"" Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said. ""Today that was the case as well. Firstly because it was our first defeat and secondly because it was completely avoidable. ""We did not do some things right just like we had done in the past weeks. The opponents before did not take advantage of it but today we were punished. ""We had a lot of chances to score our own goals."" Eintracht, whose last league victory in Munich was in 2000 before the Allianz Arena was even built, are on eight points in 13th place. The home side took the lead when Leon Goretzka benefited from a Martin Hinteregger mistake to score in the 29th minute. The Austrian defender, part of a five-man Frankfurt defence, quickly made amends by powering a header into the net for the equaliser three minutes later. Both teams had a chance to take the lead before the break with Eintracht's Almamy Toure forcing a superb save from Neuer in the 43rd minute and Bayern's Serge Gnabry hitting the post from close range a minute later. Eintracht keeper Kevin Trapp was kept busy in the second half, repeatedly denying Gnabry, Leroy Sane and Robert Lewandowski as the hosts pushed forward in search of the winner. Bayern were punished for their missed opportunities though when Eintracht scored what proved to be the winner against the run of play through Kostic before Trapp made another key save in stoppage time to palm a Goretzka shot wide.

The top-order batsman admits he is not 100% fit, but believes he will be ready for South Africa?�s opening game against Australia on Oct. 23. ""I started batting a bit yesterday, just to feel it out,"" Bavuma told reporters on Sunday. ""According to the medical team, everything is still on schedule. I am quite happy with where it's at. Everyone is happy with the progress thus far."" Bavuma will be the first black African captain for South Africa at a World Cup. He admits there is a mix of anxiety and excitement among the players, especially given the team?�s past failings at major tournaments that have earned them a ""choker"" tag and a reputation for not being able to pull through in big moments. ""Looking at the position I am in, I acknowledge the responsibility when leaving South African shores,"" he said. ""And the thinking that when you come back to South Africa, things could be different. Your life could be different. ""From a team point of view, it's excitement and the anxiety of experiencing something you haven't come across. But I think it's more excitement at the moment. ""I don't harp on a lot about being a Black African but it is quite significant, from all angles. Thinking about it now, it adds to the pressure that is already there.

sports,MLB roundup: Mitch Haniger keeps Mariners' playoff hopes alive," 2021-10-03 09:04:53 GMT+00:00 - Mitch Haniger had four hits, including a home run, and five RBIs as the Seattle Mariners kept their postseason hopes alive with a 6-4 victory against the visiting Los Angeles Angels on Saturday night. The Mariners (90-71), who have won 11 of their past 13 games, are tied with Toronto, one game behind the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox for the American League's two wild-card playoff berths. Seattle will need a victory Sunday and a loss by either the Yankees or Red Sox to force a playoff for the final wild-card spot. Jose Rojas and Jared Walsh homered for the Angels (76-85), who have lost 11 of their past 15 games. The Angels overcame a 3-1 deficit on Walsh's three-run homer in the eighth inning. Blue Jays 10, Orioles 1 Toronto belted five home runs to set a club record for the season and Alek Manoah allowed one hit in seven innings in a victory over visiting Baltimore. George Springer hit a three-run home run, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Danny Jansen added two-run blasts, and Teoscar Hernandez and Bo Bichette hit solo shots for the Blue Jays (90-71). Springer was 4-for-5 with three RBIs as the Blue Jays kept their chances for an American wild-card spot alive with one game left in the regular season. The Blue Jays' 258 homers surpassed the previous club mark of 257, which was set in 2010. Dodgers 8, Brewers 3 Julio Urias picked up his 20th win and Los Angeles pushed the National League West race to the final day of the regular season with a victory over visiting Milwaukee. Justin Turner and AJ Pollock each slugged home runs, matching their career highs. The victory moved the Dodgers one game behind the San Francisco Giants in their bid to win a ninth consecutive division title. Urias (20-3) gave up one run on one hit over 6 1/3 innings with seven strikeouts to become the National League's first 20-game winner since teammate Max Scherzer with the Washington Nationals in 2016. Brewers right-hander Corbin Burnes (11-5) went just two innings in his final tune-up start before the playoffs, giving up a three-run home run to Turner in the first inning. Burnes exited with an NL-leading 2.43 ERA. Marlins 3, Phillies 1 Jazz Chisholm slugged a three-run homer and Jesus Luzardo struck out a career-high 11 batters as host Miami defeated Philadelphia as Chisholm is trying to become just the fifth Marlins player ever to record a 20-20 season. He has 23 steals and 18 homers. Luzardo (6-9) allowed just six hits, no walks and one run in 5 1/3 innings. Phillies star and National League MVP candidate Bryce Harper went 1-for-4 with a single and three strikeouts. Two of those strikeouts came against Luzardo. Miami has won just two of its past 11 games, but the Marlins are 41-39 at home this season. With a win on Sunday, the Marlins would clinch fourth place and avoid last place in the NL East. The Phillies (82-79) have lost five of their past six games. They are out of playoff contention, but they clinched a winning season on Friday. Red Sox 5, Nationals 3 Enrique Hernandez hit a two-run homer to cap a four-run ninth inning and visiting Boston moved into a tie for the first American League wild card with a win over Washington. Boston is tied with the New York Yankees, who lost for the second straight day to the Tampa Bay Rays. The Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday to remain one game behind Boston and now New York. J.D. Martinez drew a walk against Tanner Rainey (1-3) leading off the ninth and Jose Iglesias pinch ran. Alex Verdugo and Hunter Renfroe struck out, but Christian Vazquez tripled over the head of Juan Soto in right, scoring Iglesias with the go-ahead run. Travis Shaw singled home Vazquez and Mason Thompson came on to face Hernandez, who homered to left center to make it 5-1. Rangers 7, Indians 2 Jonah Heim hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the fourth inning to lift host Texas to a win over Cleveland. Texas may be ending another losing season -- the Rangers' fifth consecutive sub-.500 campaign -- but could end things on a high note by taking the final series of the year Sunday. The Indians secured their first losing season since 2012 with the loss. Sunday's season-finale against the Rangers will be Cleveland's final game known as the Indians. The team will be known as the Guardians beginning next season. Pirates 8, Reds 6 Wilmer Difo, Cole Tucker and Michael Chavis each drove in two runs for Pittsburgh in a wild win over visiting Cincinnati. Bryan Reynolds had four hits, including an RBI triple, and Oneil Cruz added an RBI single for the Pirates, who trailed 5-0. Pittsburgh starter Max Kranick gave up four runs, three earned, and five hits in four innings. Nick Mears (1-0) got the last out in the sixth for his first career win. Chris Stratton picked up his eighth save. Eugenio Suarez and Nick Castellanos homered, Tyler Stephenson added an RBI double and Max Schrock registered an RBI single for the Reds. White Sox 5, Tigers 4 Yoan Moncada drove in three runs, including a go-ahead two-run homer in the eighth, and host Chicago stretched its winning streak to six games with a victory over Detroit. Moncada also had two doubles and scored twice. Gavin Sheets scored one run and drove in another, while Tim Anderson had two hits and an RBI as Chicago rallied from a 4-0 deficit. Aaron Bummer (5-5) pitched an inning of scoreless relief to get the win, while Liam Hendriks collected his 38th save. Detroit starter Matt Manning pitched five scoreless, allowing two hits and striking out seven. Astros 10, Athletics 4 Yordan Alvarez slugged his club-leading 33rd home run but it was a two-run triple by Michael Brantley that helped Houston secure a win over visiting Oakland. The Astros clinched home-field advantage for their American League Division Series matchup with the Chicago White Sox with the victory. Game 1 is scheduled for Thursday at Minute Maid Park. Brantley lined his third triple of the season to the right-center field gap in the bottom of the sixth inning, driving home Jake Meyers and Jose Altuve and extending the Houston lead to 8-3. The Astros maintained a tenuous grasp on their three-run advantage over the two previous innings before Brantley provided added cushion with his hit off Oakland right-hander James Kaprielian. Rays 12, Yankees 2 Brandon Lowe hit three-run homers in consecutive at-bats and added a solo shot in the seventh inning as Tampa Bay cruised to a rout of host New York. New York has a magic number of one to clinch a playoff berth. The Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners both won their respective games later Saturday, preventing the Yankees from clinching at least the second wild-card spot in the American League. By losing to Tampa Bay for the seventh time in nine home games this year, the Yankees were unable to clinch the first wild card. Lowe ensured the Yankees would not have any clarity on their playoff status by hitting his 37th, 38th and 39th homers of the season. Padres 3, Giants 2 (10 innings) San Diego stalled San Francisco's division-clinching celebration, using a go-ahead double by Jake Cronenworth with two outs in the 10th inning for a victory. The loss left the Giants still needing either one more win to claim their first National League West crown since 2012. The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night. Cronenworth's hit came after Kervin Castro (1-1) had struck out Fernando Tatis Jr. with one out and a runner at third in the 10th. But Giants manager Gabe Kapler then elected to have Castro walk Manny Machado, who had two earlier RBIs, in favor of bringing in left-hander Jarlin Garcia to face Cronenworth, whose grounder down the right-field line foiled the strategy. Twins 4, Royals 0 Griffin Jax had the first scoreless outing of his career as visiting Minnesota defeated Kansas City. Jake Cave, Miguel Sano and Luis Arraez each collected two hits for the Twins. Arraez had two RBIs. Jax (4-5), who came into the game with a 6.78 ERA, shut down the Royals' bats in his five innings. He allowed just one hit and walked two, striking out three. It was easily the best outing of his career in his 18th appearance and 14th start. Cubs 6, Cardinals 5 Ian Happ hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning to rally visiting Chicago past St. Louis. Trayce Thompson went 3-for-4 with a grand slam for the Cubs, who won for the third time in their last four games. Harrison Bader hit a homer and scored twice for the Cardinals, who lost for just the second time in their last 21 games. Cubs starting pitcher Adrian Sampson allowed one run on three hits in four innings. He struck out seven batters and walked two. Jason Adam (1-0) earned the victory in relief and Rowan Wick earned his fifth save. Braves 6, Mets 5 Outfielder Joc Pederson and catcher William Contreras hit home runs and Atlanta hung on for a win over visiting New York. Pederson hit his 18th homer and Contreras added his eighth home run, giving the Braves 238 for the season. Atlanta has homered in 125 games this season. The Braves and Mets play the season finale on Saturday. The teams have split 18 games and the Mets need a win to become the only team in the N.L. East to win a season series against the Braves. Diamondbacks 11, Rockies 2 Zac Gallen tossed six strong innings and hit a two-run double during a six-run first inning as Arizona routed visiting Colorado. Carson Kelly went 3-for-5 with two RBIs and Christian Walker had three doubles and drove in a run for the D-backs, who snapped a five-game losing streak and tied a franchise record with eight doubles. With one game remaining, the D-backs (51-110) need a victory on Sunday to avoid tying the worst record in franchise history. They were 51-111 in 2004. -Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."

Sri Lanka won the T20 World Cup in 2014 but failed to make it beyond the group stage at the last edition in 2016. They are in Group A at the World Cup this year and begin their campaign on Oct. 18 with the first of three qualifying games - against Namibia, Ireland and the Netherlands. ""I think if our batting clicks it'll give us a really good chance because our bowling attack is very good and our fielding standards have improved dramatically,"" Arthur said on Saturday. ""That (batting) is an area we've worked extremely hard on over the past nine days. ""We've been very clear in what we want our players to do in terms of our match practice... So I'm really comfortable now that we have got better at it. But it's certainly a work in progress. There's no magic wand here."" Sri Lanka will be without Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis at the World Cup after they were given one-year bans from international cricket for breaching bio-bubble protocols during the England tour in June. Arthur said the trio's absence will be a ""massive blow"" to the team, which will be captained by Dasun Shanaka. ""That was a bitter pill to swallow for sure. You suddenly got back to square one in terms of your planning again,"" he said. ""It was really disappointing, but it led us to find the likes of Charith Asalanka, who has come on beautifully, Kamindu Mendis, who's playing beautifully...

""I think he recognised we asked certain things of him in terms of when he first joined us,"" Southgate said on Saturday. ""The big challenge with us is he's 15 games without a goal. The big challenge is to start registering those numbers that our other wide players have been able to produce over a period of time. There's no reason he can't do that. ""He's physically in a better place. He's able to play the midweek games now. When we had him at the end of the season he was only able to train two days in every three, so it's a completely different situation to the European Championships."" Grealish could have the chance to break his international drought when England play away against Andorra on Oct. 9 before hosting Hungary on Oct. 12 in the World Cup qualifiers.

sports,Wildcard race bringing MLB season to a crazy end," TORONTO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - After six months and 161 games, Major League Baseball will need all 162 contests to bring the postseason picture into focus with the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners chasing two American League wildcard spots. It will be all to play for on Sunday with the Yankees (91-70) and Red Sox (91-70) holding a one game advantage on the Blue Jays (90-71). The Mariners (90-71) kept their playoff hopes alive after defeating the Los Angeles Angels 6-4 on Saturday and head into the final day of the season tied with Blue Jays, though the Mariners hold the head-to-head advantage over the Toronto side. Mitch Haniger starred for the Mariners in their epic win as he drove in five runs and also crushed a two-run homer in the fifth inning that broke a 1-1 tie. Despite their stunning victory, the Mariners will need help from the teams ahead of them if they are to play in the postseason. Should the four teams remain tied after Sunday's action it would mean two tie-breaker games on Monday, with the winners playing the wildcard contest on Tuesday. The winner of the wildcard moves into the divisional round where the Tampa Bay Rays, Houston Astros and Chicago White Sox await. ""It kind of makes sense that it would come down to the very last day,"" said Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner. ""That seems about right with the way the season has gone."" Saturday's action settled nothing as the Yankees blew a chance to clinch a wildcard berth when they were hammered 12-2 by the Rays while the Blue Jays kept their postseason ambitions moving in the right direction with the drubbing of the Baltimore Orioles 10-1. Toronto got home runs from five different players giving them an MLB leading 258 on the season establishing a new team record. The Red Sox survived a roller-coaster end to their afternoon beating the Washington Nationals 5-3 to keep pace with the Yankees. Deadlocked 1-1 going into the ninth the Red Sox scored four but then needed to fight off a Nationals rally in the bottom of the inning sparked by an Andrew Stevenson two-run homer. In New York, Rays Brandon Lowe slammed three home runs to power Tampa to 100 wins on the season and deny the Yankees an opportunity to clinch a wildcard The Blue Jays bats were also booming in Toronto as George Springer, Vladimir Guerrero Jr, Danny Jansen, Teoscar Hernandez and Bo Bichette all homered. Toronto will hope for similar production on Sunday needing a win to stay in the chase. It has been a particularly nomadic marathon for the Blue Jays who began the season playing home games at their Spring training base in Florida, moved to Buffalo, New York for much of the summer before COVID-19 restrictions in Canada relaxed enough to allow them to return to Toronto in late July. For traveling that long-and-winding road, Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo believes his team has earned the right to be in contention on the final day of the season. ""This team deserves credit and we are going to go all the way to 162,"" Montoyo said. ""We could have quit in Dunedin, then when we moved to Buffalo we could have quit there too but we never did and we deserve to be here in this moment.""

sports,Liverpool boss Klopp compares vaccine refusal to drink-driving," Oct 3 (Reuters) - Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp likened refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine to drink-driving, saying such people endanger others. Klopp said he took the vaccine to protect not just himself but ""all the people around me"". The 54-year-old also said that 99% of his Liverpool players are vaccinated and that he did not have to convince anyone to do so. British media reported last week that only seven of the 20 Premier League clubs have squads where more than 50% of players are vaccinated. ""If I say I am vaccinated, other people say: 'How can you tell me I should be vaccinated?' It is a little bit like drink-driving,"" Klopp said ahead of Sunday's home game with Manchester City. ""We all probably were in a situation where we had a beer or two and thought we still could drive but (because of) the law, we are not allowed to drive so we don't drive. ""But this law is not there for protecting me when I drink two beers and want to drive, it's for protecting all the other people because I'm drunk and we accept that as a law."" Klopp said vaccination is not a limit on freedom. ""I don't understand why that is a limitation of freedom because, if it is, then not being allowed to drink and drive is a limitation of freedom as well,"" he said.

Major League Baseball Network reported Saturday that Tingler ""will be relieved of his managerial duties."" It is known that San Diego general manager A.J. Preller is considering a change. The Padres responded to the report by MLBN's Jon Heyman with a statement. ""Per A.J. Preller, no decision has been made on Jayce's employment status at this time. Heyman's report is completely premature. (Tingler) will be managing our game today."" The Padres are 79-82 after ending a seven-game losing streak with a 3-2, 10-inning victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday. After being 67-49 on Aug. 10, San Diego has gone a porous 12-33 in a startling fall from likely playoff participant to clinching a losing campaign. The Padres are 27 games behind the first-place Giants in the National League West. ""Look, I hear the same things you hear,"" Tingler told reporters after Saturday's game of his status. ""But at the same time, I'm trying to be present and trying to manage. ""I feel bad for the noise for the guys. I'm really proud of the way they have been busting. They deserved the win today."" Tingler said the dialogue between himself and Preller has remained good down the stretch of the season. ""A.J. and I have been talking."" Tingler said. ""We'll talk postgame and we'll talk tomorrow morning. Look, I don't have social media. I do have a phone and I get a lot of texts. So look, I get it."" Tensions in the clubhouse became a hot topic two weeks ago when third baseman Manny Machado and shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. engaged in an intense shouting match and were separated by teammates. The Padres conclude their season on Sunday against the Giants. Teams typically dismiss managers one day later.

sports,MLB roundup: Angels put crimp in Mariners??playoff hopes," 2021-10-02 09:37:56 GMT+00:00 - Luis Quijada came on in relief with runners at the corners and no outs in the seventh inning and struck out the next three hitters as the visiting Los Angeles Angels damaged the Seattle Mariners' playoff hopes with a 2-1 victory Friday. Brandon Marsh hit a two-run double in the third inning as the Angels won for just the fourth time in their past 14 games. The Mariners, who had won four in a row and 10 of 11, dropped a game behind Boston in the race for the second AL wild-card berth. Seattle is tied with Toronto. The Mariners' run came on Jarred Kelenic's RBI double in the second inning. Angels left-hander Jose Suarez (8-8) allowed just one run on three hits over five innings. He walked two and struck out five. Closer Raisel Iglesias allowed a leadoff double to Kyle Seager in the ninth but got a tapper back to the mound, an infield fly and a flyout to right to get out of the inning to earn his 34th save. Dodgers 8, Brewers 6 Trea Turner had a grand slam among his two home runs, Matt Beaty hit a go-ahead blast and Los Angeles remained alive to earn at least a tie for the National League West title by rallying for a victory over visiting Milwaukee. Despite the win, the Dodgers still experienced a loss as veteran left-hander Clayton Kershaw left the game in the second inning with discomfort in his left forearm. The Dodgers, who already have qualified for the postseason as at least a wild-card team, remain two games behind San Francisco in the division with two games to play. The Giants' magic number is one to deny the Dodgers a ninth consecutive NL West title. Christian Yelich and Eduardo Escobar each had two hits and two runs for the Brewers, who are playoff-bound as the NL Central champs but have lost three of four. After entering with a career 1.89 ERA against the Dodgers, Milwaukee left-hander Eric Lauer gave up five runs on six hits over five innings. He walked two and struck out three. Giants 3, Padres 0 Anthony DeSclafani combined with four relievers on a nine-hit shutout as host San Francisco won its seventh straight and clinched at least a tie for the National League West title by beating San Diego. Staked to a 2-0 lead in the first inning, DeSclafani (13-7) breezed through five innings, allowing four hits and no walks. He struck out three. Jose Alvarez, Dominic Leone, Tyler Rogers and Doval (third save) wrapped up with four innings of scoreless relief. Darin Ruf hit his 16th homer of the season, and the Padres got two hits apiece from Fernando Tatis Jr., Trent Grisham and Wil Myers. San Diego dropped its seventh straight and 12th in its last 13. Red Sox 4, Nationals 2 Hunter Renfroe snapped a scoreless tie with a three-run homer in the sixth inning and visiting Boston got a much-needed win over Washington. Bobby Dalbec followed Renfroe's blast with a solo home run as Boston won for just the second time in seven games. The Red Sox moved one game ahead of the Seattle Mariners in the race for the AL's second wild-card berth. The Toronto Blue Jays are also a game back. The Red Sox also moved to within one game of the New York Yankees for the first wild card. Boston's Eduardo Rodriguez (12-8) went five-plus scoreless innings, allowing five hits. He struck out six and walked three. Josh Rogers (2-2) gave up four runs on seven hits for Washington, which has lost six of its last seven games. Alcides Escobar and Jordy Mercer had solo homers for the Nationals. Rays 4, Yankees 3 Rookie Wander Franco hit a two-run single in the ninth inning and Kevin Kiermaier hit a tiebreaking single in the second as visiting Tampa Bay recorded a victory over New York, which was unable to clinch a postseason spot. The Yankees entered the game with a magic number of two to clinch their fifth straight postseason spot but their loss and Boston's win over Washington left that number still at two. Kiermaier's hit helped the Rays move one win from their first 100-win season in team history. Nelson Cruz homered three batters in for the 449th of his career, tying the slugger with Hall of Famers Vladimir Guerrero Sr. and Jeff Bagwell for 40th on the all-time list. Blue Jays 6, Orioles 4 Danny Jansen hit a two-run home run and had three RBIs, left-hander Steven Matz pitched into the eighth inning and Toronto held on to defeat visiting Baltimore. Corey Dickerson added a solo home run and Cavan Biggio had three hits and an RBI for the Blue Jays in the opener of a three-game series. Pat Valaika hit a two-run home run and Kelvin Gutierrez hit a solo shot for the Orioles. Austin Hays added two hits and threw out a runner at home for Baltimore. The Blue Jays remained one game behind Boston for the AL's second wild-card berth, but gained ground on Seattle, which had been tied with Boston until it lost later Friday. Rockies 9, Diamondbacks 7 Dom Nunez hit a tying homer in the ninth inning and Trevor Story delivered the tiebreaking single later in the inning as Colorado recovered from a seven-run deficit to post a win over Arizona in Phoenix. Sam Hilliard hit a three-run homer and Brendan Rodgers had three hits for the Rockies. Rookie pitcher Humberto Castellanos hit a three-run homer for his first major league blast for the Diamondbacks, who lost their fifth straight game. Arizona stands one setback shy of the franchise record for losses (111 in 2004). Christian Walker added a two-run homer and Ketel Marte slugged a solo shot for the Diamondbacks. Mets 4, Braves 3 Brandon Nimmo hit a pair of solo home runs and starter Tylor Megill worked five scoreless innings to help New York defeat host Atlanta, which rested several regulars after clinching the NL East the day before. Nimmo's homers gave him eight this year and paced the team's 11-hit attack. Pete Alonso had three of those hits. Megill's only hit allowed was a single by Ozzie Albies with one out in the fourth. Edwin Diaz, the Mets' fifth pitcher, worked a scoreless ninth and earned his 32nd save. Atlanta starter Huascar Ynoa (4-6) pitched five innings and allowed three runs on six hits, two walks and six strikeouts. The Braves scored a run in the sixth off Jeurys Familia when Albies doubled in Ehire Adrianza. Eddie Rosario and Adrianza hit solo homers for the Braves. Phillies 5, Marlins 0 Bryce Harper went 3-for-5 with a home run and two RBIs and reliever-turned-starter Ranger Suarez (8-5) struck out a career-high nine batters as Philadelphia blanked host Miami. Harper, a National League MVP candidate with 41 doubles, 35 homers and 84 RBIs, rolled his left ankle after smashing his double in the third inning but remained in the game and homered in the fifth inning. The Phillies snapped a four-game losing streak and clinched a winning season. Marlins starter Sandy Alcantara (9-15) went five innings, allowing five hits, one walk and four runs, while striking out six. The 15 losses are a career worst for Alcantara, who finished the year with 205 2/3 innings pitched and 201 strikeouts. Cardinals 4, Cubs 3 Paul Goldschmidt delivered the game-winning hit in the bottom of the ninth as St. Louis edged visiting Chicago. Tyler O'Neill produced two homers, a double and three runs scored for the Cardinals, who won for the 19th time in 20 games. Cardinals starting pitcher Dakota Hudson threw five shutout innings while allowing just three hits and a walk, striking out four. Trayce Thompson hit a three-run homer for the Cubs, who lost for the eighth time in their last 10 games. A's 8, Astros 6 Matt Olson and Chad Pinder homered and Sean Manaea pitched 5 2/3 effective innings as visiting Oakland outlasted Houston. Manaea (11-10) allowed two runs on seven hits and one walk with six strikeouts. Lou Trivino tossed 1 1/2 scoreless innings for his 22nd save. Jason Castro hit a three-run homer for the Astros, whose lineup was without five regulars one night after clinching the AL West for a fourth time in five seasons. Pirates 9, Reds 2 Cole Tucker's first career grand slam came during an eight-run eighth inning as host Pittsburgh handed Cincinnati its third straight loss. Tucker also tripled and scored and made two stellar defensive plays. Pittsburgh starter Wil Crowe allowed one hit in six shutout innings. He struck out nine, walked two and retired the final 12 batters he faced. Chris Stratton (7-1) gave up a run in the eighth for the Pirates. Jose Barrero had an RBI triple and Max Schrock an RBI single for the Reds. Starter Luis Castillo gave up one run and six hits in 5 1/3 innings, with three walks and five strikeouts. Amir Garrett (0-4) allowed two runs in one-third of an inning for the Reds. Indians 9, Rangers 6 Jose Ramirez drove in three runs to lift Cleveland to a victory in Arlington, Texas. Ramirez had a two-run single to cap the Indians' four-run third inning before adding an RBI single as part of a five-run fourth. Austin Hedges and Bobby Bradley each belted a solo homer and Harold Ramirez drove in two runs for Cleveland. Rookie Eli Morgan (5-7) tossed 5 2/3 innings and allowed four runs but got the win. Jose Trevino launched a two-run homer and Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Nathaniel Lowe (three hits) also went deep for the Rangers. Royals 11, Twins 6 Hunter Dozier had three hits, including a home run, as Kansas City pummeled visiting Minnesota. Every Royals player in the starting lineup had a hit except for major league home run leader Salvador Perez. Whit Merrifield led the team with three hits. Kansas City starter Jon Heasley (1-1) earned his first major league win in his third outing. He allowed four runs on six hits in 5 1/3 innings, with three of the runs coming in the sixth. The Twins, the two-time reigning American League Central champion, were assured of a last-place finish with the loss. John Gant (5-11) allowed six runs on eight hits in four innings for the Twins. He walked two and struck out three. -Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Afghan basketball star makes debut in Spain after leaving Kabul," BILBAO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The captain of the Afghan women's wheelchair basketball team made her debut for her new Spanish side on Saturday to cheers and applause just over a month after fleeing Kabul when the Taliban came to power. Nilofar Bayat, 28, and her husband Ramesh Naik Zai, 27, were offered the chance to play for Bidaideak Bilbao BSR, a wheelchair basketball team in the northern city of Bilbao. They arrived in Madrid from Kabul on Aug. 20 on a flight with 100 other refugees thanks to efforts by the Spanish government and the Spanish Basketball Federation. ""I have never had this much kindness and this much respect. When I saw how welcoming they are... I felt that here can be my second home, I can be very happy here,"" Bayat, 28, told Reuters after the game. It was the first time Bayat had played on a mixed team. On Saturday, she was the only woman playing for Bidaideak Bilbao BSR in the side's friendly match against Fundacion Vital Zuzenak. ""It was very new for me, in Afghanistan it's not like this,"" she said. ""The teams are very separated and we do not play together, but it was very nice."" Bayat rolled onto the court to a standing ovation from the crowd. Afterwards, she and her husband were presented with flowers.

sports,Deignan makes history by winning first women's Paris Roubaix," Oct 2 (Reuters) - Britain's Lizzie Deignan rode to a landmark victory in the inaugural Paris Roubaix Femmes as rain, mud and crashes made it a memorable debut for the world's best female riders over the infamous cobbled course on Saturday. The former world champion produced a dominant ride over the 115.6km course and held off a powerful late surge by Dutch great Marianne Vos to win by one minute and 17 seconds. ""I feel incredibly proud,"" Deignan, who adds the maiden Paris Roubaix to her other notable triumphs including last year's Liege-Bastogne-Liege, said. ""Women's cycling is at this turning point, and today is part of history. It proves the appetite for women's cycling and that the riders can do one of the hardest races in the world."" ""Today I was the third rider (in the team) and I had to be in the front at the first cobbled section to protect my leaders. But then I saw there was a gap so I just kept going."" After three circuits around Denain, Trek Segafredo rider Deignan established a small lead over the pack just before the first of 17 cobbled sections with more than 80km remaining. With riders struggling to organise a concerted chase, many of them slithering over on the greasy cobbles, former world champion Deignan powered into a commanding lead. With 30km remaining the Trek-Segafredo rider held a lead of two minutes 30 seconds over a group including Vos (Jumbo Visma), team mate Audrey Cordon-Ragot and Germany's Lisa Brennauer (Ceratizit-WNT). Deignan, handling the bone-shaking ""pave"" cobblestones with aplomb, maintained her advantage as several fancied riders including European champion Ellen van Dijk crashed heavily. Vos finally put the hammer down to try and catch Deignan, slicing into the lead as she powered through the Carrefour de L'Arbre cobbled section. Vos closed the gap to 1:18 as Deignan began the final 10km, but Deignan proved unshakeable out front as the famed Roubaix velodrome finish approached. Deignan was so far ahead that the finale inside the Roubaix velodrome resembled a lap of honour as the Yorkshire rider wrote her name into the cycling history books. Vos finished more than a minute behind, with Deignan's team mate Elisa Longo Borghini in third place. Organisers ASO, who also own the Tour de France, added a women's version of the 125-year-old Paris Roubaix last year, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant they had to wait another year to ride the so-called Hell of the North. The debut for the Paris Roubaix Femmes race and for a women's Tour de France next year are seen as steps forward in the long battle for gender equality in professional cycling, although there remains a long way to go. While Sunday's men's race over a longer distance boasts a total prize pot of 91,000 euros, the women's race has only 7,505 euros with Deignan receiving 1,535 euros - about 1/20th of what the winner of the men's race will take home.

The Gunners were held goalless through the first 45 minutes by a dogged Villa defence, but Little made the breakthrough six minutes after halftime for the league pace-setters, and the home side's resistance crumbled in the final 10 minutes. Mana Iwabuchi, who spent the first six months of 2021 at Villa, added a second for the visitors in the 80th minute before substitute Katie McCabe netted a superb third three minutes later.

World soccer governing body FIFA said it is ""deeply concerned"" about allegations of abuse in the sport in the United States. The Athletic on Thursday ""Due to the severity and seriousness of the allegations being made by players, we can confirm that FIFA?�s judicial bodies are actively looking into the matter and have opened a preliminary investigation,"" FIFA said in a ""As part of this, FIFA will be reaching out to the respective parties, including US Soccer and NWSL, for further information about the various safeguarding concerns and allegations of abuse that have been raised."" Riley, who has reportedly denied any wrongdoing, was terminated by the Courage and the league. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. ""I am so sorry for the pain so many are feeling,"" Baird said in a written statement hours before she turned in her resignation and announcing that the league's weekend slate of games would not go on. ""Recognizing that trauma, we have decided not to take the field this weekend to give everyone some space to reflect. ""Business as usual isn't our concern right now. Our entire league has a great deal of healing to do, and our players deserve so much better."" General counsel Lisa Levine was also sacked, according to the Athletic. The report sent shockwaves through the sport and the players' association demanded sweeping changes across the league, as some of soccer's most prominent figures - including twice World Cup winners and NWSL players Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan - voiced their outrage. ""This pause will be the first step as we collectively work to transform the culture of this league, something that is long overdue,"" added Baird. U.S. Soccer said it would immediately launch an independent investigation into the allegations of abusive behavior and sexual misconduct.

sports,Willett leads heading into final round of Alfred Dunhill Links Championship," Oct 2 (Reuters) - Former Masters champion Danny Willett produced an impressive bogey-free round of six-under 66 to claim a three-shot lead at the end of the third round of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Saturday. The Englishman finished the day at 14-under for the tournament, ahead of overnight leader Tyrrell Hatton, who started brightly with four birdies in the opening five holes before letting his advantage slip with three successive bogeys on the back nine to end with a one-under 71. ""Got off to a very nice start, and then just hit a couple of loose shots, just lost all momentum, to be honest. I think from the eighth hole, just never really got anything going our way,"" said Hatton. ""I think there were only a couple of times where I had a realistic birdie chance, and I hit a good putt, and it bobbled off line or whatever."" Hatton was tied for second place with the trio of Shane Lowry, Richard Bland and John Murphy, all of whom made the most of friendly scoring conditions at the Old Course at St Andrews. The Old Course will play host to the final round on Sunday after being used in rotation -- alongside Carnoustie and Kingsbarns -- for the first three days of the event. Former British Open winner Lowry, who featured in Europe's Ryder Cup defeat at Whistling Straits last week, looked in superb touch as he fired five birdies on the front nine that included a 24-foot putt on the second to finish with a five-under 67. ""There's a bit of fatigue... obviously, it's a bit of calm now from last week (at the Ryder Cup)... but it's still a big tournament. I'm a competitive person. When I come to play, I want to do well. So, I'm out there giving it my all,"" said the Irishman. ""Anybody that's involved in golf and has been here knows that this place is probably one of the most special places in the world... so, to be able to lift the trophy on that green will be incredible.""

sports,"Chelsea top after return to winning ways, Man Utd held"," LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Chelsea returned to winning ways with a 3-1 victory over Southampton to move top of the Premier League but Manchester United stuttered again at home on Saturday as they were held to a 1-1 draw by high-flying Everton. After consecutive defeats for only the second time since Thomas Tuchel took charge, Chelsea needed a response and they got it as Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell struck late on after Southampton had been reduced to 10 men. Tuchel's side move to 16 points from seven games, two more than Liverpool who host Manchester City in Sunday's big clash. Manchester United and Everton are also locked on 14 points after the early kickoff at Old Trafford ended honours even. Brighton and Hove Albion also have 14 points after a 0-0 home draw with Arsenal played in torrential rain. With Cristiano Ronaldo, scorer of a last-gasp winner against Villarreal in the Champions League on Wednesday, starting on the bench, United took a deserved lead when Anthony Martial was played in by Bruno Fernandes to score in style just before the  halftime interval. United were pegged back though when Andros Townsend finished off a sweeping move -- the winger celebrating with a trademark Ronaldo pose in front of Everton's travelling fans. Rafa Benitez's side thought they had snatched a late victory when Yerry Mina slotted in but after a VAR review he was adjudged to have been offside. It was a let-off for United but they were still left frustrated at dropping more home points after last weekend's 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa, especially with a tough-looking run of league fixtures ahead. ""We had 75% possession. We got hit on one break that cost us and we lacked that cutting edge to get the important second goal,"" United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. ""We just couldn't get that second goal you need in games like this as Everton can score a goal from nowhere."" 'RIGHT MOMENTS' Ronaldo came off the bench but this time the Portuguese could not summon a dramatic ending. ""It's about picking the right moments (to give Ronaldo a rest),"" Solskjaer said when asked about the decision to put him on the bench and start with Edinson Cavani. After Chelsea failed to score in their last two games, it was unsung academy product Trevoh Chalobah who put them in front after nine minutes. Romelu Lukaku and Werner both had goals ruled out and when, on the hour, Ben Chilwell tripped Tino Livramento in the area to earn Southampton a penalty that James Ward-Prowse converted, it looked as though the visitors would earn a point. But Ward-Prowse was red-carded for a poor tackle on Jorginho and Chelsea took advantage to claim the win. ""It was absolutely a deserved victory. We played a good match of football, an entertaining match of football because Southampton played strong,"" Tuchel said. ""There are a lot of things for him to improve but we are happy and relieved we scored in the late minutes."" Leeds United kickstarted their campaign with a first league win -- Diego Llorente's early goal proving enough to beat Watford 1-0 at Elland Road. Promoted Norwich City earned their first point of the season and ended a run of 16 consecutive Premier League defeats as they ground out a 0-0 draw at fellow strugglers Burnley. Newcastle United's troubles also continued as the Magpies went down 2-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers for whom South Korean forward Hwang Hee-chan struck twice from assists by Raul Jimenez to help Wolves move clear of the relegation zone. Norwich remain bottom with one point with Newcastle and Burnley, who are also winless, on three.

Laporta said on Saturday, before their defeat to Atletico, that he had spoken to Koeman and the Dutchman deserved time to change the club's fortunes around after a stuttering start to the season.

sports,Suarez piles misery on former club as Atletico see off Barcelona," MADRID, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Former Barcelona striker Luis Suarez heaped more misery on his old club as Atletico Madrid claimed a 2-0 LaLiga victory over the Catalans at the Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday. First-half strikes from Thomas Lemar and Suarez were enough for the champions to secure all three points and heap pressure on the visitors' beleaguered boss Ronald Koeman. Barca have won just one game in their last six in all competitions as their early season struggles show no signs of easing. ""We're suffering, I'm going to be honest with you,"" Barca defender Gerard Pique said. ""We started well enough, we were brave, but then they create two identical situations and scored twice - whereas we could've played for three hours and not scored. ""It isn't one problem, there are several. People can see what we lack. But we'll recover. They're difficult times, a lot of us haven't experienced this before. We want to turn it around but it isn't easy."" Atletico started the brighter and went close through Lemar and Joao Felix efforts from the edge of the box before the Frenchman opened the scoring in the 23rd minute. Felix fed Suarez, who played a brilliant ball round the corner to send Lemar through and he powered his effort past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Suarez then missed a glorious chance to double the lead moments later as he skewed a one-on-one effort wide, but made no mistake on the stroke of halftime after Lemar returned the favour to tee him up. Barca's best opportunity to get back into the game fell to Philippe Coutinho, however the Brazilian's tame effort was comfortable saved by Jan Oblak. Victory moved Atletico level with table toppers Real Madrid, who travel to Barca's city rivals Espanyol on Sunday, on 17 points from eight games.

sports,Nice stay in top four with 2-1 win over Brest," NICE, France, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Nice stayed in touch with Ligue 1 leaders Paris St Germain after goals in each half by defenders Jean-Clair Todibo and Melvin Bard helped them to a 2-1 home win over struggling Brest on Saturday. The result lifted Nice one place up to third on 16 points from eight games, eight adrift of runaway leaders PSG who visit Stade Rennes on Sunday, and two behind second-placed Lens who have played a game more. Brest, who are still looking for their first league win of the season, stayed 19th on four points from nine games. Dominant Nice should have won by a bigger margin as they were denied by a string of saves from Brest goalkeeper Marco Bizot and by some wayward finishing. Bizot kept out a pair of Andy Delort headers early on and Calvin Stengs somehow shot wide of the far post from two metres before Todibo fired the home side ahead on the stroke of halftime.

sports,Bagnaia bags third straight MotoGP pole at Austin GP," AUSTIN, Texas, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Ducati's Francesco Bagnaia ended Marc Marquez's run of seven straight poles at the Grand Prix of Americas on Saturday as he topped qualifying and sealed a third consecutive pole this MotoGP season. Bagnaia's last lap of two minutes 02.781 seconds was just enough to push six-times world champion Marquez into third, with world championship leader Fabio Quartararo of Yamaha taking second place. ""We worked a lot this week. I really enjoy qualifying... I gave it my all in the second attempt, the last corner was a bit wide, but very happy,"" said Bagnaia, who trails Quartararo by 48 points in the race for the championship. Quartararo said: ""We are struggling a little more than usual in qualifying. Pecco (Bagnaia) was really fast but it is always great to start in the first row. Let's see what we can do tomorrow."" Rookie Jorge Martin of Pramac Ducati will start fourth ahead of LCR Honda's Takaaki Nakagami, while Bagnaia's team mate Jack Miller, despite being fast all weekend, could only manage 10th. A number of riders, including former world champion Valentino Rossi, crashed during qualifying following concerns this week that the Circuit of the Americas in Texas was too bumpy, with Quartararo calling it ""a joke"" and ""unsafe"".

sports,"We didn't deserve to win, says Arteta as Arsenal misfire again"," BRIGHTON, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said his side did not deserve to win following a toothless attacking display in a 0-0 draw away to Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday, but the Spaniard took some comfort from a solid defensive performance. After a thrilling 3-1 win over bitter rivals Tottenham Hotspur last week, Arsenal were brought back to earth with a bump as Graham Potter's side mesmerised them at times with the kind of free-flowing football Arteta would dearly love to see from his team. Brighton had a total of 21 attempts, but only two of them were on target as Arsenal defended doggedly, and although Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit a post with a first-half header, their blunt performance in possession is a cause for concern. ""(The header) was probably the only open situation in the first half, and we were unlucky not to score it. I don't think we deserved to win the game, we have to take the draw with the performance we had today and improve,"" Arteta told the BBC. The Gunners improved after the break and had a decent 10-minute spell late in the game, but other than that they looked lost as they sought to create chances of their own. ""We didn't make enough right decisions, every time there was a duel where we could escape pressure and attack open spaces we came up short and against this structure we had to do better,"" Arteta said. His defenders did well to keep up with Brighton's fluid, intelligent attacking football, and although they came under pressure at set pieces, they often managed to get blocks in or force their hosts to shoot from distance. ""We have conceded one goal in the last five games which is really positive ... we can now focus on the things we are doing well and work on the ones we need to improve,"" Arteta said.

sports,Super sub Dzeko inspires Inter comeback win against Sassuolo," Oct 2 (Reuters) - Inter Milan substitute Edin Dzeko equalised a minute after coming on before winning the decisive penalty as the Italian champions earned a 2-1 comeback win over Sassuolo togo second in Serie A on Saturday. Domenico Berardi?�s penalty put the hosts in front midway through the first half, but Dzeko made an immediate impact by heading in the leveller with his first touch in the 58th minute. The Bosnian, who became the joint-top scorer in Serie A alongside Lazio's Ciro Immobile with six goals, was then brought down by goalkeeper Andrea Consigli in the box and Lautaro Martinez dispatched the resulting spot kick. ""I have scored a lot of goals but I do not remember if I have ever scored with the first touch, there is a first time for everything,"" Dzeko told DAZN. ""I know how much I still have to offer, Inter know that too and decided to sign me to score goals."" Inter rose to second place on 17 points, one point behind leaders Napoli, who travel to Fiorentina on Sunday. Sassuolo are 13th with seven points. Simone Inzaghi?�s side needed a response after back-to-back draws against Atalanta in Serie A and Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, but they went behind after 22 minutes at the Mapei Stadium. Jeremie Boga dribbled into the box and was tripped by Milan Skriniar, allowing Berardi the chance to dispatch the opener from the penalty spot. Chances flew in at both ends, with Consigli beating away a Nicolo Barella drive and Samir Handanovic tipping over a dipping Berardi volley. On the brink of halftime, Sassuolo's Gregoire Defrel latched onto a loose back pass to go clean through on goal and collided with Handanovic after the goalkeeper had rushed out of his box, but the referee ignored the home side?�s appeals for a red card. The incident caused controversy after the game, with Inter coach Inzaghi saying it was the correct decision, while his Sassuolo counterpart Alessio Dionisi disagreed. ""Referees can make mistakes and we must accept the verdict, even if it is not always good. We deserved more,"" Dionisi told Sky Italia. ""We would have won if we had returned to the pitch in the second half with an extra man."" It was just as well for Inter that Handanovic remained on the pitch, as the Slovenian saved them twice early in the second half, blocking a Rogerio shot with his legs before getting a hand to a powerful Boga shot. Inzaghi rang the changes by bringing on four new players at once and was immediately rewarded when one of those replacements, Dzeko, headed in an Ivan Perisic cross a minute later. The Bosnian is the first player to score at least six goals in his first seven Serie A games in a debut season for Inter since Brazilian great Ronaldo in the 1997-98 campaign. Dzeko then raced after a through ball and was barged over by Consigli for Martinez's decisive spot kick in the 78th minute. His night almost got even better when he tapped in a Barella cross, but the striker was flagged for offside. ""I think that after playing every three days the changes needed to be done, there were guys who came off who did not deserve to come off, but I had to give a boost to the team because there were a lot of tired players,"" Inzaghi said. Inter's victory meant they scored at least two goals for a 12th consecutive league match, overtaking their previous longest run of 11 games from 1943. Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Brighton held to goalless draw by unimpressive Arsenal," BRIGHTON, England, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Brighton & Hove Albion created a slew of chances but failed to get many of them on target as they were held to a 0-0 draw by a  rudderless Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday. On a wet, blustery evening, Arsenal's Bukayo Saka got the game off to a promising start with a raid down the right and a shot straight at Robert Sanchez in the opening minute, but it was one of few chances for the visitors in a dismal attacking performance. Brighton defender Lewis Dunk fluffed a golden chance to give the home side the lead in the 21st minute, blazing the ball high over the bar after it was spilled by Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale. The Seagulls dominated the opening 45 minutes but it was Arsenal who went closest to scoring as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed against the post from a tight angle during a rare first-half attack. The home side were sharper all over the field, their incisive passing and quick movement pulling the Arsenal defence all over the place, and the visitors' limited attacks were short-lived as Brighton won the ball back and began again. Named on the left of a five-man midfield, Brighton's Spanish defender Marc Cucurella put in a superb performance up and down that flank, taking part in attacks and getting back to snuff out any counters. But for all their possession, Brighton struggled to get shots on target and they were almost punished when Emile Smith Rowe broke away in the 75th minute, but Sanchez was able to steer his shot behind for a corner. With the final whistle approaching, Brighton turned the screw as they created a flurry of late chances, but the Arsenal rearguard held firm despite conceding 21 goal-scoring opportunities to claim a scarcely-deserved point. ""It was a difficult game, they made it hard and we have to give credit to them,"" said Arsenal's Ramsdale. ""We have got to get around that, we have to show more composure and intensity on the ball and make it harder for them."" The result sees Brighton rise to fifth in the table on 14 points after seven games, two behind leaders Chelsea. Arsenal, who have only managed five goals in their opening seven league games, are ninth on 10 points.

The hosts were far from impressive for more than an hour but the game unravelled for gutsy Bochum midway through the second half and just seconds after substitute Silva came on. The Portuguese proceeded to score his first goal from open play since his big-money move from Eintracht Frankfurt this season, heading in from close rage in the 70th minute to break the deadlock. He then sent Christopher Nkunku through, who flicked the ball in for their second goal of the evening four minutes later. The in-form Frenchman then sealed victory when he scooped the ball over the keeper and into the net in the 78th to double his tally and make it nine goals in 10 games in all competitions this season. The win, Leipzig's second in a row, lifted them up to seventh place on 10 points.

sports,"I would never force players to pick Socceroos, says coach Arnold"," HONG KONG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Coach Graham Arnold has said he will not force anyone to play for Australia over other nations as he revealed Gianni Stensness has yet to receive official clearance to complete his switch from New Zealand to the Socceroos. Stensness declared last week his intention to change allegiance to Australia having represented New Zealand at the Olympic Games - a move All Whites coach Danny Hay called a ?�kick in the guts?? The Australia-born 22-year-old, who was eligible to play for New Zealand through his father, was not included in Hay?�s 21-man squad for October friendlies against Curacao and Bahrain and decided to represent Australia at senior level, said New Zealand Football. Administrative delays have kept the defender out of the Australian squad for this month's World Cup qualifiers against Oman and Japan, but Arnold revealed he had been in discussions with Stensness - a near-neighbour in Sydney - for some time. ""I spoke to him three days ago and we're still waiting for the paperwork from FIFA for his clearance that he can play for Australia,"" said Arnold. ""It's very fortunate that he lives in the same area as me and we caught up and we've had those discussions about him playing for Australia and he's chosen to play for Australia."" Stensness could be joined in future Socceroos squads by Dinamo Zagreb's Deni Juric, who is also being pursued by Croatia, with Arnold looking to strengthen his squad as the Australians attempt to qualify for a fifth straight World Cup. ""At the end of the day it's his decision,"" said Arnold. ""Which country, which badge he puts on his heart is going to feel the right badge. ""I'd never force anyone to do something that they don't really believe in because if I do that then they're not going to feel comfortable in that shirt and they're not going to give 100 percent if they're forced into it."" Australia have won their last 10 World Cup qualifying matches in a row and go into the meeting with Oman on Oct. 7 with six points from their opening two games in the final phase of Asia's preliminaries for the 2022 World Cup. Arnold's team defeated China and Vietnam in their first two qualifiers and face an Oman side that handed Japan a shock 1-0 loss in their opening game in Osaka last month. The Socceroos are also due to take on Japan at Saitama Stadium on Oct. 12, and Arnold has selected a 25-man squad that sees Melbourne Victory's Chris Ikonomidis join Rhyan Grant as the only Australia-based players on the roster. ""The confidence and the belief, they're building in the boys. They're starting to believe they can win every game, which is fantastic and that's what I'd expect of the boys when they come into camp,"" said Arnold. ""It's one game at a time and there's a strong belief in what their qualities are.""

sports,Late Locatelli strike hands Juventus win over Torino in Turin derby," TURIN, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Manuel Locatelli struck late to earn Juventus a 1-0 win over Torino in the Turin derby on Saturday, as the Old Lady stretched their winning run to four games in all competitions and kept a Serie A clean sheet for the first time in seven months. The Italy international fired a shot in off the post with four minutes remaining, his second consecutive league goal, as Juve rose to eighth place with 11 points, three ahead of their 11th-placed rivals. ""I think over the last few weeks the team has found the right spirit, the desire to defend when we need to defend and attack when we need to attack,"" Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN. ""It would have been a disappointment to not win a game after this performance which, after the first half against Milan, was our best of the season."" Torino controlled the first half as Juve failed to register a shot on target, but Allegri?�s side improved after the break and Alex Sandro?�s header required a fine save from Vanja Milinkovic-Savic before Locatelli?�s late winner. Ivan Juric?�s side struggled to threaten Wojciech Szczesny?�s goal, and Juventus kept things tight defensively to end a run stretching back to March of 20 matches in a row conceding in Serie A. Locatelli's second goal for Juventus sparked big celebrations, but the 23-year-old explained that they came at a cost. ""I got a headbutt from Giorgio Chiellini and with the head that he has, I am sure that I have a bruise,"" Locatelli said. ""But it is a fantastic feeling, because since I arrived here the group has been incredible, they welcomed me. We are a big group of friends and real people, despite having a lot of great players they are all humble."" Allegri?�s side earned an impressive and unexpected win over European champions Chelsea in the Champions League on Wednesday to stretch their unbeaten run in all competitions to five matches. But the coach warned his players that the local derby would be an even greater challenge, with strikers Paulo Dybala and Alvaro Morata still injured and Torino having two extra days to prepare. There were early chances for Juve as Moise Kean flashed a shot wide and Weston McKennie blasted over a promising opportunity. But Toro soon gained control and came close when Sasa Lukic glanced a header wide and Rolando Mandragora?�s long-range piledriver was parried by Szczesny. Allegri introduced Juan Cuadrado for Moise Kean at halftime, with Federico Chiesa returning to the striker role he played against Chelsea. The change sparked some life into Juve?�s attack as the Colombian teed up Sandro with an excellent cross that required a sharp Milinkovic-Savic save. Locatelli found space at the edge of the area to fire home the winner in the 86th minute, before substitute Dejan Kulusevski thumped the foot of the post with a shot in stoppage time. Earlier on Saturday, Salernitana climbed off the foot of the table after Milan Djuric?�s header sealed a 1-0 win over Genoa, their first victory of the season. The newly promoted side?�s victory moved them up to four points, one behind Genoa in 16th and one more than bottom side Cagliari.

sports,Consortium acquires controlling stake in Saracens for 32 mln pounds," Oct 2 (Reuters) - A consortium of investors has agreed terms to acquire a majority controlling stake in Premiership side Saracens for 32 million pounds ($43 million), the club said on Saturday. Saracens, four times Premiership champions and three times European Cup winners in the last five years, were relegated last season as punishment for multiple salary cap breaches. But they returned to the top flight after winning the second-tier Championship. The club said the consortium comprises club chairman Neil Golding and Dominic Silvester and Paul O'Shea from Enstar Group, a global insurance group. South African former World Cup-winning captain and Saracens player Francois Pienaar, Nick Leslau, the chairman and chief executive of Prestbury Investment Holdings, and Marco Masotti, an owner of South Africa's Sharks rugby team, are also in the consortium. Nigel Wray, who was the club's owner for more than 25 years, said he would be retaining a ""significant minority shareholding"". ""I'm not getting any younger and I have always wanted to make sure that Saracens is in very safe hands for many future generations,"" he said in a statement. The club said the takeover is subject to regulatory approval. The new funds would be used to complete the redevelopment of the West Stand at the club's StoneX Stadium, invest in women's sport and establish a high performance training centre, it said. ""We move on from the recent challenges with hard lessons learned and with robust new governance procedures in place,"" Golding said in a statement.

sports,Tuchel hails Chelsea's fresh faces after win over Southampton," LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel heaped praise on a clutch of players he brought in from the sidelines who steered the Blues to a 3-1 win over Southampton on Saturday, saying they were not suffering from the same kind of pressures as his bigger-name stars. Tuchel responded to defeats by Manchester City in the Premier League and by Juventus in the Champions League over the past week by overhauling his starting team and handing chances to players who have been given little opportunity to shine. Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ben Chilwell came in for their first league starts of the season while Callum Hudson-Odoi and defender Trevoh Chalobah were brought back into the team. Chalobah opened the scoring for Chelsea after Loftus-Cheek flicked on a Chilwell corner, and Ross Barkley, another out-of-favour player at Stamford Bridge, came on as a substitute to help create the Blues' second goal, scored by Timo Werner. ""They have this kind of totally positive spirit and they don't feel the pressure,"" Tuchel told reporters. ""In the last two games we lost and we felt there something was lacking."" Tuchel said he decided to leave Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech, both of them big-money signings for Chelsea, on the bench after they struggled to find their form recently. ""At some point, after a lot of chances, we have to admit that Kai and Hakim are not in their very best shape,"" he said. ""Nobody is angry at them, nobody has major concerns,"" Tuchel added. ""Some players don't feel the pressure so much, don't have such high expectations of themselves... In a club like Chelsea you need to be sharp every three days and you need to fight for your place.""

sports,"Targeted with racist behaviour, Smereck says change is overdue"," Oct 1 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Hockey League (UHL) player Jalen Smereck told Reuters on Friday he would return to the ice despite an opponent targeting him with racist behavior, but the American said reform was long overdue for the sport. A video showing HC Kremenchuk forward Andriy Deniskin peeling and eating a banana in a gesture directed toward the HC Donbass defenceman, who is Black, during a game shocked the global hockey community this week and prompted outcry over racism in the sport. Deniskin was suspended for 13 games - only three of which are mandatory if he pays an additional fine 50,000 hryvnia ($1,900) fine - leading to further outrage as critics, including numerous National Hockey League (NHL) players, called the penalty too lenient. ""When I came here I kind of figured I?�d be on my own and, you know, it?�d be tough,"" Smereck, 24, told Reuters. ""I kind of knew that I would face some racial incidents but I definitely never thought it would be something like this. ""It?�s gone too far. I think, 2021, this type of stuff shouldn?�t be going on."" Smereck said Deniskin had not reached out to him directly, aside from an attempted apology immediately after the game. The American has been in touch with Evgeniy Kolychev, the former general manager of the UHL who told Reuters on Friday he was sacked for speaking out against racism and not preventing a video of the incident being published on the league's official website. But Smereck said that no one else from the league had contacted him since the incident - something he did not find particularly surprising. ""It?�s everywhere you go,"" he said. ""I?�ve faced it in every league, OHL, American League, so it?�s going to be everywhere you go. There?�s no way to hide from it, there?�s no way to go around it."" Born in Detroit, Smereck picked up ice hockey when he was two years old and quickly fell in love with the sport, relishing the chance to meet new people and travel. He had a stint under an entry-level contract with the NHL's Arizona Coyotes prior to joining HC Donbass and said he generally liked playing in Ukraine, where he gets along with his team mates while daily errands like grocery shopping prompt attention from onlookers. ""I feel like the president or like LeBron James,"" said Smereck, who idolises Jackie Robinson, a player who broke the racial barrier in Major League Baseball, and said he hopes to emulate the late sports pioneer. Smereck has returned to the ice - largely out of loyalty to his team mates - but said he would not settle for the status quo in the sport and was determined to create change for the next generation of players. ""I really want to take advantage of the moment while there?�s kids out there seeing this, just to let them know and try to really get on top of this and flip it around so that the kids don?�t look at this the wrong way, and encourage them to play hockey.""

sports,"For rookie QBs, struggle is real"," 2021-10-01 17:35:35 GMT+00:00 - No wobbly pass, stare-down interception, busted assignment or coughed-up fumble underscores the sad state of the NFL's underwhelming rookie quarterback class more than these ugly statistics. Between towering Jacksonville Jaguars starter Trevor Lawrence, New York Jets signal caller Zach Wilson and New England Patriots quarterback and Cam Newton replacement Mac Jones, they've combined for a 1-8 record, 17 interceptions and only nine touchdown passes. The highest rated rookie quarterback is Texans third-round draft pick Davis Mills, who's off to a respectable start in one start and two games played with an 80.9 rating ahead of Jones' 79.1, Wilson's 51.6 and the Chicago Bears' Justin Fields' 39.9 mark. Lawrence bumped his rating to 66.4 with a better showing Thursday night at Cincinnati. As heralded as this group was during the preseason, their performance has been ugly nearing the quarter-pole of the regular season. Fields' first NFL start last Sunday was a disaster: 6 for 20 for 68 yards, and sacked nine times for 67 lost yards. The Bears had one net yard of passing offense in the 26-6 defeat to the Cleveland Browns. Traditionally, rookie quarterbacks struggle. Justin Herbert's rookie debut last season with the Los Angeles Chargers was the exception, not the rule. Peyton Manning was intercepted 11 times in his first four NFL starts. Troy Aikman went 0-11 as a rookie with the Dallas Cowboys. John Elway was awful as a rookie with the Denver Broncos. There are far more Dwayne Haskins, Josh Rosen, Josh Allen, Jared Goff and Sam Darnold type of beginnings. No one has approached Lamar Jackson, Robert Griffin III or Andrew Luck's level as rookies. This has been a house of horrors start for the rookies this year, and it isn't even close to Halloween. The rebuilding Jets have been decimated by injuries on offense. Jaguars coach Urban Meyer is a former college football coaching legend who's still learning on the job in the NFL. He staged a forced quarterback competition with Gardner Minshew before finally trading Minshew to the Philadelphia Eagles. Jones split time with Newton during the preseason before the team jettisoned the former NFL MVP. Jones has been solid at times while playing in a somewhat conservative offense. Fields hasn't been named the starter even though veteran Andy Dalton has a knee injury. Lawrence, Wilson, Fields and Jones combined on Sunday to pass for 717 yards, two touchdowns and seven interceptions for a 53.2 passer rating. Lawrence and Wilson are tied for the NFL lead with seven interceptions. Jones was intercepted three times on Sunday. He's led the offense to two touchdowns in 20 possessions when not playing the Jets. Meanwhile, Mills, while basically uncelebrated, had a solid performance against the Carolina Panthers as he completed 18 of 28 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions for a 95.5 passer rating. Whether the early struggles derail promising careers remains undetermined. Past failure doesn't always prevent future success, but a competent offensive line and a sound game plan sure does help. The notion that all rookie quarterbacks need to sit has been disproven over the years, but talent isn't enough. Asking Lawrence to carry the Jaguars or Wilson to get by without any pass protection isn't a realistic or sustainable plan and it can stunt their development and damage their health. As for San Francisco 49ers rookie quarterback Trey Lance, his team has been smart about his adjustment to the NFL. He's played only seven snaps as the backup to Jimmy Garoppolo. Kyle Shanahan is bringing along Lance slowly, which appears to be a very wise move. --By Aaron Wilson, Field Level Media Our Standards: Alexander Zverev notched his first career win against Andy Murray on Tuesday with a 6-4 7-6(4) victory that moved him into the fourth round at Indian Wells."
sports,Chelsea beat 10-man Southampton 3-1 to get back on track," LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Chelsea got back to winning ways on Saturday, beating Southampton 3-1 in the Premier League thanks to late goals by Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell after the Saints were reduced to 10 men. Blues coach Thomas Tuchel overhauled his side after back-to-back defeats by Manchester City in the English title race and by Juventus in the Champions League and he was rewarded when one of the fresh faces, defender Trevor Chalobah, put the hosts ahead. He stooped to head in at the far post after nine minutes when Ruben Loftus-Cheek, making his first start of the season, flicked on a corner by Chilwell, who was also restored to the team for the first time this campaign. Chelsea thought they had extended their lead twice before halftime only for the officials to rule out the efforts by Romelu Lukaku and Werner, which incensed Tuchel who earned a yellow card for his protests. Southampton hit back with a penalty converted by James Ward-Prowse in the 61st minute after Chilwell fouled former Chelsea defender Tino Livramento. The game only swung back Chelsea's waywhen Ward-Prowse was shown a straight red card 16 minutes later for a foul on Jorginho which was picked up by the VAR officials and the hosts made their numerical advantage count. In the 84th minute Werner scored from point-blank range after a cross by captain Cesar Azpilicueta and five minutes later Chilwell atoned for giving away the earlier penalty by smashing the ball in after a goalmouth scramble. The win lifted Chelsea to the top of the table ahead of Sunday's clash between fellow title contenders Liverpool and Manchester City. Winless Southampton remain just outside the relegation zone. Tuchel said he was relieved that his team had not succumbed to nerves after their two defeats in the past week. ""We had to be careful that we don't start being too sad and too worried,"" he told BBC radio. ""It was necessary that we have better performances than the last two, that we shape up our belief and we sharpen our mindset.""

sports,Britain's Joyce wants 2016 Olympic gold if fight manipulation is proven," LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - British heavyweight Joe Joyce said on Friday that he should be handed the 2016 Olympic gold medal if his Rio de Janeiro final with Frenchman Tony Yoka was found to have been manipulated by corrupt boxing officials. The fight was one of 11 called into question by an independent report, commissioned by the sport's governing body, the AIBA, and published on Thursday, that found evidence of corruption and manipulation. ""It's sad to see corruption in any sport but particularly in boxing,"" said Joyce, the silver medallist who lost the Olympic super-heavyweight final on a 2-1 split decision, in a statement on Instagram. ""I firmly believe that I was the winner of the match with Tony Yoka and deserved the gold medal. But on the day I did not get that decision and at the time I accepted that."" Joyce, who has since turned professional and remains unbeaten, said he had scanned the results of the investigation led by Richard McLaren and had read that corruption in the AIBA had affected the result of his fight. ""If corruption has taken place, and it appears that it has, I trust AIBA and the IOC (International Olympic Committee) will ensure the integrity of the sport is upheld and award me the gold medal,"" he added. ""I will be considering the report in detail with my legal team and await the decision of AIBA and the IOC. Corruption should never be allowed to succeed.""

sports,'Stop attacking our children': Sparta Prague condemn reports of Kamara abuse," Oct 1 (Reuters) - Sparta Prague have hit out at media reports that Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara was targeted by sections of a crowd comprising mainly schoolchildren during Thursday's 1-0 Europa League home win. In March, Finland's Kamara had complained of being racially abused by Slavia Prague's Ondrej Kudela during a Europa League tie and the continent's soccer governing body UEFA banned the Czech defender for 10 games. Kamara was jeered throughout Thursday's game at the Letna Stadium, which UEFA had initially ordered closed for the match after Sparta supporters had racially abused Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni in a Champions League qualifier. It later decided to allow 10,000 children to attend the game against the Scottish champions. The jeering reached its peak in the second half when Kamara was sent off, media reports said. ""It is absolutely unbelievable that after a match we have to watch innocent children being attacked and face unfounded accusations of racism,"" the Czech club said in a ""Insulting children on the internet and in the media is unacceptable, desperate and ridiculous. ""Stop attacking our children! Our club will proudly defend our children - our future and our pride. Slandering children on the internet is extremely cowardly."" Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhanek said he would summon Britain's ambassador on Monday to discuss the issue. Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office did not respond to a request for comment. ""Enough! Intentionally spread, disgusting insults against Czech children in the media and on the internet do not belong to football and even less so to good relations between two countries,"" Kulhanek wrote on Twitter. Kamara's lawyer Aamer Anwar said Kulhanek's government should use the opportunity to ""address the deep rooted racism that exists in their country"". 'SADDENED AT ABUSE FROM CHILDREN' Anwar said Kamara was ""saddened at the abuse he received from children"", adding that the midfielder wondered what would have happened if the stadium had adult fans in attendance. ""UEFA in its wisdom decided to give seats to 10,000 schoolchildren in the stadium. Anyone watching the match would have heard a significant proportion of children jeering and booing Glen Kamara every time he touched the ball,"" Anwar told Reuters. ""Racism does not happen in isolation, children pick up what happens around them and that is why it was so depressing to watch yet another cycle of prejudice in Prague. ""I spoke to Glen this afternoon, he says he just wants to get on with playing football... He said he switched off his phone last night due to the racist bile which has not stopped."" Rangers manager Steven Gerrard initially said after the game that he was not aware of the booing but said on Friday that he heard it when he watched the game again. ""I'm fully aware now, having watched the game back with audio on. I'm actually surprised that I wasn't aware of it during the game,"" Gerrard told reporters. ""I have spoken to Glen Kamara, that conversation will remain private... Glen's okay, I'm sure he's disappointed, just like myself. ""I've been told that Rangers are going to take it up with UEFA. I think those wheels are already in motion. I'll certainly be pushing to make sure that's the case.""

The Braves got six strong innings from starter Ian Anderson and home runs from Jorge Soler and Austin Riley to beat the visiting Philadelphia Phillies 5-3, clinching their fourth consecutive National League East championship. The Astros used a 3-2 victory over the visiting Tampa Bay Rays to win the American League West for the fourth time in five seasons. Houston's Carlos Correa set a career high with his 25th home run, and Lance McCullers Jr. worked six solid innings for Houston, which had lost five of the previous six games. McCullers carried a no-hitter into the sixth. He allowed two runs on three hits and one walk, with four strikeouts.

Yankees 6, Blue Jays 2 Gleyber Torres hit a two-run home run to cap a three-homer barrage in a four-run sixth inning and visiting New York defeated Toronto. Aaron Judge hit his second of two home runs and Anthony Rizzo also hit a solo shot in the sixth inning as the Yankees won the rubber match of an important three-game series. With the win, the Yankees upped their lead for the American League's first wild card to two games over the Boston Red Sox and idle Seattle Mariners.

Giants 5, Diamondbacks 4 A walk-off single by LaMonte Wade Jr. lifted San Francisco to a victory over visiting Arizona, allowing the Giants to maintain their two-game lead on the second-place Dodgers in the National League West. The hit increased Wade's amazing ninth-inning success rate to 13-for-23 (.565) and gave the Giants their fifth walk-off win of the season. Former Giants World Series star Madison Bumgarner received a nice ovation from the San Francisco fans before allowing four runs in five innings. Giants reliever Tyler Rogers (7-1) tossed two scoreless innings for the win. Dodgers 8, Padres 3 Mookie Betts and Corey Seager belted consecutive home runs to open the first inning, Justin Turner and AJ Pollock went back-to-back in the fourth and Los Angeles beat visiting San Diego.

Ha-Seong Kim and Fernando Tatis Jr. homered for the Padres, who lost their ninth consecutive meeting with the Dodgers and were swept by their division rival for the third consecutive series. San Diego has lost six in a row overall and 11 of the past 12.

Rookie Ryan Mountcastle clubbed his 33rd home run, a three-run shot off Red Sox starter Nick Pivetta (9-8), who failed to complete five frames for the eighth time in his last 15 starts. Baltimore won its final home series while handing Boston its fifth loss in six games.

The left-hander combined with relievers Rex Brothers and Jason Adam, who pitched an inning each, on a six-hit shutout. Rafael Ortega homered and stole home, Willson Contreras added an RBI double while Matt Duffy and David Bote hit RBI singles for the Cubs. The Pirates fell to 59-100. Mets 12, Marlins 3 Rich Hill finally earned his first win with New York, when the 41-year-old left-hander tossed five solid innings in a victory over visiting Miami. The Mets took three of four from the Marlins in their final home series of the season.

sports,Former England defender Butcher wants heading phased out of the game," Oct 1 (Reuters) - Former England defender Terry Butcher wants heading to be gradually phased out of the sport to reduce the risk of brain trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Butcher, 62, was a no-nonsense centre back who was strong in the air and famously suffered a head wound playing for England in a World Cup qualifier in 1989, but stayed on the pitch and ended the game covered in blood. With several former players, especially from England's World Cup-winning team of 1966, being diagnosed with dementia, Butcher said he eventually wanted to see no heading in football. ""I think you have to look at safety, you have to look at families losing their loved ones too early. I think it's something that has been strong, particularly in Britain, the way that we used to play but not so much now,"" Butcher told the BBC. ""I think it's something that we can do without and then it would rule out the trauma of heading a football, particularly at pace. You've got to get some brain trauma in there because your brain is going to rattle against your skull. ""Then of course you're looking at aerial collisions where you have no real control. I'd like to see it phased out... a gradual process with everybody coming together."" New research showed former footballers are 3.5 times more likely to die with dementia than the general public and the risk is highest among defenders, who are five times more likely to have dementia than non-footballers. The Premier League announced recommendations ahead of the new season based on a study and said players should attempt only a ""maximum of 10 higher force headers"" in a week during training sessions.

The Englishman started the day at eight-under and looked in control with two early birdies before tough windy conditions saw him bogey the 10th, 13th and 16th holes at Kingsbarns, ending the day on 10-under for the tournament. Compatriot Daniel Gavins sank an eagle on the par-five 14th to move into second place with a four-under 68 at Carnoustie, while former Masters champion Danny Willett made the most of a lightning start -- two birdies and an eagle in his first three holes -- to stand two shots back following a round of 69. The championship is being held across three courses in rotation over the opening three days -- the Old Course at St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns -- with the final round to be played at St Andrews.

sports,Sacked Ukraine league manager says blamed for video of racist incident spreading," KYIV, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The former general manager of the Ukrainian Hockey League (UHL) told Reuters on Friday he was sacked for speaking out against racism and not preventing a video of a racist incident being published on the league's official website. The video shocked the global hockey community this week in which a player in the UHL mimed peeling and eating a banana in a gesture directed towards a Black player during a match. Evgeniy Kolychev said he was sacked by the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine for speaking out against racism. In a phone interview, he also echoed calls for tougher punishments for players found guilty of racist behaviour. ""I was accused of publishing a video on the league's website and spreading it all over the world,"" Kolychev said. ""And I did not interfere with the publication of the video. Indeed, I did not interfere with this because the League would not want to hide this fact."" Reuters could not independently verify his claims. The hockey federation has not responded to requests for comment but on its website listed six reasons for Kolychev's dismissal, including ""dissemination of false information that discredits the image of Ukrainian hockey in general"". HC Kremenchuk forward Andriy Deniskin was suspended for 13 games after he taunted HC Donbass defenceman Jalen Smereck, the only American player in the eight-team league. ""I am the only one who called Jalen,"" Kolychev said. ""He felt bad. A stream of hate fell upon him. ""My position is absolutely clear: there is no place for racism in hockey. My dismissal is a banal reprisal against me because I did not want to hush up the fact of racist statements,"" Kolychev added. Smereck said on Instagram he will not play another game in the UHL unless Deniskin is removed from the league, which is made up mostly of Ukrainian and Russian players. Deniskin apologised on Instagram, saying he acted in the heat of the moment and that he respects all people regardless of race or nationality. He later deleted the post after coming under fire for being insincere. Kolychev echoed calls for tougher punishment for racist incidents. Under the UHL's rules, only three games of Deniskin's 13-game ban are mandatory, and the player can avoid serving the remaining 10 games if the club pay a 50,000 hryvnia ($1,900) fine, or 5,000 hryvnia per game. A 13-match suspension was not enough, Kolychev said, while acknowledging it was the maximum punishment under the league's regulations. Kolychev said he was fired during a Zoom meeting with the hockey federation on Thursday after only a month in his job as general manager. He said the reasons given by the federation were an excuse to get rid of him. ""I wasn't even allowed to say a word. I concluded by saying that I thank you for not letting me speak. It was absolutely anti-democratic.""

Many clubs refused to release players to 'red list' countries such as Brazil and Argentina last month and the Premier League is looking to avoid a similar situation which angered national federations. The strict COVID-19 quarantine rules require those who return to England from a red list country to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, but players will now be quarantined at ""bespoke facilities"" and will be allowed to train or play. ""We have worked closely with football authorities to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of both club and country while maintaining the highest levels of public health and safety,"" a government spokesperson told Reuters. ""Our best defence against the virus is vaccination and these new measures will allow fully vaccinated players to fulfil their international duties in the safest, most practical way possible, while allowing them to train and play with their clubs as early as possible upon their return."" The international break runs from Oct. 4-15, with the Premier League resuming on Oct. 16. Players returning from international duty will be fully segregated from the public for 10 days and ""significant public health mitigations and protocols"" will be in place when they leave the facility to train or play for the club. Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, who would see four of his players go into quarantine under the plan, was not impressed. ""You can choose the hotel yourself but food has to be delivered in front of your room door. You are not allowed to have any visitors. If that's the solution, I don't know where it's coming from,"" Klopp told a news conference. ""That would mean for the players that they go for 10-12 days with their national teams, then they go another 10 days away from their families into quarantine. ""That's 22 days!

Three-time winners Chennai, led by former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 2020 and finished second from bottom in the eight-team Twenty20 tournament. But Chennai's core of ageing players have turned around their fortunes superbly this year and on Thursday defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by six wickets with Dhoni finishing off the game in Sharjah with a trademark six in the final over. With three more league games remaining, Chennai will aim to go on and seal a top-two finish that would give them two shots at qualifying for the Oct. 15 final in Dubai. ""I'm not big on momentum,"" former New Zealand captain Fleming told reporters. ""Momentum can go just as quick as you have it. We don't really talk about that. ""What we probably have been afforded is the opportunity to manage workloads a bit better. We are afforded that luxury now but we won't be too experimental."" As India grappled with a COVID-19 surge, the league was suspended near its halfway stage in May after two franchises reported several positive cases. The remainder of the season was then shifted to the United Arab Emirates and restarted last month. Chennai have won all four matches they have played in the UAE so far. ""I think I mentioned at the time we were really proud of the way we finished (in 2020). We won the last four games in a row and started to get a little bit of rhythm together,"" said Fleming.

They are students of 30-year-old Manisuru Kizza Ssejjemba, who fell in love with the martial art form after watching Jet Li movies as a teenager. Ssejjemba, who had previously trained in kick-boxing, became so skilled that by 2009 he started starring in movies made by  Wakaliwood, a Ugandan low-budget action film company. ""Who Killed Captain Alex"", Wakaliwood's biggest film, has nearly 6.5 million views on YouTube. Ssejjemba has high hopes for his students. ""Even if one person can go and compete in [the] Olympics ... it will be very good for me,"" he said, a golden dragon emblazoned on the back of his black robe. Kung Fu is not presently an Olympic sport, but promoters are fighting for its inclusion. It is an event at the Youth Olympic Games. ""I will never give up until Kung Fu reaches (the) top,""  Ssejjemba said. His passion to teach others was fostered when he travelled to China in 2017 to train with Kung Fu experts. ""We went there and shot a movie which is known as 'Bruce U'... we got some techniques from [the] abbot, and he told us to come back to Africa and spread Kung Fu,"" Ssejjemba said. So Ssejjemba did. He opened up the Kiman Lee Fitness Club in his backyard where he trains young people between five and 16. Many of his students are girls, encouraged by their communities to gain self-defence skills.

sports,Bout manipulation existed at Rio 2016 Olympics says independent report," Sept 30 (Reuters) - A bout manipulation system existed in boxing at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Richard McLaren, the head of the independent investigation commissioned by the sport's world governing AIBA, said in his report on Thursday. McLaren said the first of three stages of the investigation looked into the refereeing and judging at Rio where controversial decisions in certain bouts made the headlines. ""The seeds of this were sown years before, starting from at least the Olympic Games of the 21st century through the events around 2011 and London 2012,"" McLaren told a news conference in Lausanne. ""The qualifying competitions along the route to participation in Rio in 2016 were the practise ground for the corruption and manipulation of bouts at Rio. ""At the Olympic qualifiers, the manipulation methodology was fine tuned in anticipation of use in Rio."" McLaren said he could not comment on whether the results of manipulated bouts would be overturned, saying that was not up to him to decide as the lead investigator. ""The information we have will be turned over to the boxing federation,"" he added. ""If they think there's justification in declaring that the bout was manipulated then, based on the rules at the time, the decision will have to be made."" The report said a comprehensive study suggested at least nine bouts were suspicious while two bouts caused the system to ""publicly collapse"". Those include the gold medal heavyweight bout between Russia's Evgeny Tischenko and Kazakhstan's Vassily Levit as well as the bantamweight quarter-final between Ireland's Michael Conlon and Russia's bronze medallist Vladimir Nikitin. Tishchenko won the gold medal to a chorus of boos from the crowd on a unanimous points decision even though Conlan, who was the reigning world and European Champion, lost on a controversial split decision to Vladimir Nikitin, leading to the Irishman going on an expletive-laden rant on live television after the loss. At the time, the AIBA had reviewed decisions in over 200 bouts and removed some judges and referees from the Rio Games after boxers said they were robbed. ""Lads I want my medal, get it sorted and I'll DM you my address,"" Conlan told the AIBA on MANIPULATION STRUCTURE McLaren said the manipulation structure was made possible because key personnel decided the rules did not apply to them. He added that AIBA's then president Wu Ching-kuo ""bears ultimate responsibility for the failures of officiating at Rio and the qualifying events"" and that he was supported by his Executive Director Karim Bouzidi in Rio. Taiwan's Wu, who had been at the helm of the AIBA for 11 years, was ""For example, the Executive Director seized powers belonging to the permanent Commissions. The Commissions would let this happen as did the President,"" McLaren said. ""Once having acquired the power, he (Bouzidi) would oversee the appointment of referees and judges (R&Js) that knew what was going on but would comply with the manipulation or who were incompetent but wanted to continue as an R&J so were willing to comply or turn a blind eye to what was going on."" Frenchman Bouzidi was ""reassigned"" by the AIBA during the boxing tournament in Rio after numerous controversial decisions. The report also said the president ""avoided discussion of what he apparently knew was inappropriate conduct"" in his reports to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). McLaren added: ""Bouts were manipulated for money, perceived benefit of AIBA, or to thank National Federations and their Olympic committees, and, on occasion, hosts of competitions for their financial support and political backing. ""Boxing has a problem, it's not about the rules and processes. It's a people problem. For too long people have worked outside the rules."" Umar Kremlev, who took over as AIBA president last year, said they hired McLaren because they had ""nothing to hide"". ""We will work to incorporate any helpful recommendations that are made. We will also take legal advice with regard to what action is possible against those found to have participated in any manipulation,"" Kremlev said in a statement. ""There should be no place in the AIBA family for anyone who has fixed a fight."" The International Olympic Committee said it would ""carefully study"" McLaren's findings before deciding on the consequences.

NBA executive director Michele Roberts revealed this week that over 90 percent of the league's players are fully vaccinated, while ESPN reported Thursday that 95 percent of players have now received at least one shot. Still, the topic of vaccinations has become hot-button. The NBA mandated that all team employees except for players must be vaccinated, and there is tension within the league about that difference. Mandatory vaccinations for players has been a non-starter with the National Basketball Players Association, although the league has instituted strict protocols for unvaccinated players. ""Everyone who is vaccinated should be pissed at those who aren't,"" a veteran assistant coach told ESPN. ""Not requiring NBA players to be vaccinated is (expletive)."" Protocols for unvaxxed players could include eating and traveling apart from vaccinated teammates as well as being located in a different part of the locker room. Kyrie Irving, Andrew Wiggins and Bradley Beal are among the players who have made public their opposition to getting the vaccine. Beal later clarified, saying he would still consider receiving it. Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James said it's not his place to be an advocate to other players, but did reveal he is fully vaxxed after doing his research.

science,"Hearth site in Utah desert reveals human tobacco use 12,300 years ago"," WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Scientists have unearthed evidence of a milestone in human culture - the earliest-known use of tobacco - in the remnants of a hearth built by early inhabitants of North America's interior about 12,300 years ago in Utah's Great Salt Lake Desert. Researchers discovered four charred seeds of a wild tobacco plant within the hearth contents, along with stone tools and duck bones left over from meals. Until now, the earliest documented use of tobacco came in the form of nicotine residue found inside a smoking pipe from Alabama dating to 3,300 years ago. The researchers believe the nomadic hunter-gatherers at the Utah site may have smoked the tobacco or perhaps sucked wads of tobacco plant fiber for the stimulant qualities offered by the nicotine it contained. After tobacco use originated among the New World's native peoples, it spread worldwide following the arrival of Europeans more than five centuries ago. Tobacco now represents ""On a global scale, tobacco is the king of intoxicant plants, and now we can directly trace its cultural roots to the Ice Age,"" said archaeologist Daron Duke of the Far Western Anthropological Research Group in Nevada, lead author of the research published on Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. The seeds belonged to a wild variety of desert tobacco, named Nicotiana attenuata, that still grows in the area. ""This species was never domesticated but is used by indigenous people in the region to this day,"" Duke said. The Great Salt Lake Desert today is a large dry lake bed in northern Utah. The hearth site at the time was part of a vast marshlands, with a chillier clime during the twilight of the Ice Age. It is called the Wishbone site owing to duck wishbones found in the hearth. The hearth remnants were found eroding out of the barren mud flats where wind has been peeling away sediment layers since the marshlands dried up about 9,500 years ago. ""We know very little about their culture,"" Duke said of the hunter-gatherers. ""The thing that intrigues me the most about this find is the social window it gives to a simple activity in an undocumented past. My imagination runs wild."" Artifacts there included small sharp stone cutting tools and spear tips made of a volcanic glass called obsidian, used for hunting large mammals. One spear tip bore the remains of blood proteins from a mammoth or mastodon - elephant relatives that later went extinct. ""We surmise that tobacco must have figured into the ecological knowledge base of those who settled the interior of the North American continent, some 13,000-plus years ago,"" Duke said. Tobacco domestication occurred thousands of years later elsewhere on the continent, in the Southwestern and Southeastern United States and in Mexico, Duke added. ""We don't know when exactly tobacco was domesticated, but there was a great florescence of agriculture in the Americas within the last 5,000 years. Evidence for the use of tobacco, both direct - seeds, residue - and indirect - such as pipes - increases during these times alongside the domestication of food crops,"" Duke added. Some scholars have argued that tobacco may have been the first plant domesticated in North America - and for sociocultural rather than food purposes. ""There is no doubt that people would have already been at least casually tending, manipulating and managing tobacco well before the population and food-requirement incentives that drove investments in agriculture,"" Duke said.

science,Energy from bogs: Estonian scientists use peat to make batteries," TARTU, Estonia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Peat, plentiful in bogs in northern Europe, could be used to make sodium-ion batteries cheaply for use in electric vehicles, scientists at an Estonian university say. Sodium-ion batteries, which do not contain relatively costly lithium, cobalt or nickel, are one of the new technologies that battery makers are looking at as they seek alternatives to the dominant lithium-ion model. Scientists at Estonia's Tartu University say they have found a way to use peat in sodium-ion batteries, which reduces the overall cost, although the technology is still in its infancy. ""Peat is a very cheap raw material - it doesn't cost anything, really,"" says Enn Lust, head of the Institute of Chemistry at the university. The process includes heating decomposed peat to a high temperature in a furnace for 2-3 hours. The university expects the government to fund a small-scale factory in Estonia to try out the technology. Distillers in Scotland dry malt over peat fires to flavour whisky, and some northern European countries use peat to fuel factories and households, or as fertilizer. As bogs are drained to mine peat, they release trapped carbon dioxide, raising environmental concerns. But the Estonian scientists say they are using decomposed peat, a waste product of traditional extraction methods that is usually discarded. Sodium-ion batteries using peat will need to prove they are commercially viable and can be scaled up, Lukasz Bednarski, a market analyst and the author of a book on batteries, told Reuters. China's CATL ""I think that companies will increasingly try to commercialize the sodium-ion battery, especially after the CATL announcement,"" said Bednarski. Less powerful sodium-ion batteries are likely to be used together with lithium-ion technology to bring down the overall cost of a battery pack, he said.

Dangerous blood clots can occur in moderate COVID-19 A European study has found an elevated risk of a life-threatening blood clot called venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients who were not critically ill. The blood clot risk had previously been associated with severe COVID-19. The researchers tracked 2,292 patients who came to hospital emergency rooms with mild or moderate COVID-19 but without VTE. Four weeks later, VTE had developed in roughly 1 of every 200 mildly ill patients who had not been hospitalized and nearly 5 of every 200 moderately ill patients overall, the researchers reported on Friday in High-dose blood thinners prevent clots in moderate COVID-19 In hospitalized, moderately ill COVID-19 patients who have high levels of the d-dimer protein in their blood - indicating a higher-than-average risk for dangerous blood clots - treatment with high doses of the blood thinner low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) significantly reduced the odds of clot formation and death, according to data from a clinical trial.

science,Japanese scientists work up an appetite for lab-grown Wagyu beef," TOKYO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Japan's famed Wagyu beef, a delicacy that can cost more than $200 a pound at some top restaurants, could become much more affordable in the form of a lab-grown replica. Japanese scientists say they have succeeded in recreating Wagyu, renowned for its fat marbling, in a laboratory to produce something that could eventually look and taste like the real steak. Wagyu beef comes from a breed of black cattle, most famously cultivated in the Kobe area of Western Japan. Osaka University researchers led by Michiya Matsusaki used 3-D bioprinters and bovine stem cells to replicate Wagyu's distinctive marbling in a solid steak-like piece, rather than a minced form that has typified other attempts at cultured meat. It currently takes about three to four weeks to generate a cubic centimetre of cultured meat, so it's not ready for the grocer's aisle just yet. But as the techniques and efficiency improve, the method could produce something that mimics the real thing, Matsusaki said. ""If we are able to quickly produce a lot of meat from a few cells, there's a chance we can better respond to food and protein shortage issues in the future,"" Matsusaki told Reuters. Environmental and ethical concerns around the meat industry have driven interest in vegetable alternatives and the potential for lab-grown products. That has spurred strong growth in developers of real meat alternatives, including plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods Inc which is preparing for a public listing that could exceed $10 billion, sources say. Matsusaki said the bioprinting and culture techniques developed in his lab could also have applications in human medicine, such as growing replacements for damaged muscles. It now takes about 10,000 yen ($89.40) to produce a single gram of lab-grown Wagyu, but with more automation, the price could drop such that it would be marketable for the general public within five years, Matsusaki said.

science,Chinese lunar samples suggest moon cooled down later than thought," BEIJING, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Remnants of solidified lava brought back by a Chinese mission were 1 billion years younger than material acquired by other missions decades ago, according to an Samples brought back from U.S. and Soviet missions were more than 2.9 billion years old. The samples acquired on China's Chang'e-5 mission late last year - around 1.96 billion years old - suggests volcanic activity persisted longer than previously expected. Last December, the uncrewed Chinese probe touched down on a previously unvisited part of a massive lava plain, the Oceanus Procellarum or ""Oceans of Storms"". About 1,731 grammes of lunar samples were later retrieved and brought back to Earth. One of the main objectives of Chang'e-5, named after the mythical Chinese goddess of the moon, was to find out how long the moon remained volcanically active. ""The Oceanus Procellarum region of the Moon is characterised by high concentrations of potassium, thorium, and uranium, elements that generate heat through long-lived radioactive decay and may have sustained prolonged magmatic activity on the near side of the Moon,"" wrote the article's authors, including Chinese researchers. The article said the heat source for the magmatic activity might also be due to so-called ""tidal heating"", or heat generated by the gravitational tug and pull of the Earth.

science,Nobel chemistry prize goes to duo who developed a tool for molecule building," STOCKHOLM, Oct 6 (Reuters) - German Benjamin List and Scottish-born David MacMillan won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for developing new tools for building molecules that have helped make new drugs and are more environmentally friendly. Their work on asymmetric organocatalysis, which the award-giving body described as ""a new and ingenious tool for molecule building"", has also helped in the development of plastics, perfumes and flavours. ""Organic catalysts can be used to drive multitudes of chemical reactions,"" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. ""Using these reactions, researchers can now more efficiently construct anything from new pharmaceuticals to molecules that can capture light in solar cells."" Catalysts are molecules that remain stable while enabling or speeding up chemical reactions performed in labs or large industrial reactors. Before the laureates' breakthrough findings at the turn of the millennium, only certain metals and complex enzymes were known to do the trick. The academy said the new generation of small-molecule catalysts were more friendly for the environment and cheaper to produce, and praised the precision of the new tools. Before asymmetric catalysis, man-made catalysed substances would often contain not only the desired molecule but also its unwanted mirror image. The sedative thalidomide, which caused deformities in human embryos around six decades ago, was a catastrophic example, it said. ""The fact is, it is estimated that 35 per cent of the world?�s total GDP in some way involves chemical catalysis,"" it added. List, 53, said the academy caught up with him while on vacation in Amsterdam with his wife, who in the past had liked to joke that somebody might be calling him from Sweden. ""But today we didn?�t even make the joke and certainly didn?�t anticipate this - and then Sweden appears on my phone... it was a very special moment that I will never forget,"" he said, dialling into the media briefing announcing the winners. List, 53, is director of the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Kohlenforschung, Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany. He said he did not initially know that MacMillan was working on the same subject and figured his hunch might just be a ""stupid idea"" until it worked. He and MacMillan share the prestigious 10-million Swedish crown ($1.14-million) prize in equal parts for breakthroughs achieved independently of one another. CHEMISTRY 'IMPACTS EVERYTHING' MacMillan, 53, who said he was only the second person in his western Scotland working class family to go to college, noted that it was often challenging for chemists to explain the significance of their work to the outside world. ""But the one thing I will say is that everything we do, or what a chemist does, impacts everything that's around us all the time,"" he told a briefing at Princeton University, where he is a professor. The impact of his students' work can be almost immediate, said MacMillan, who has dual U.S. and UK citizenship. ""They are literally doing experiments on a Tuesday, they discover something -- we have discussions with major pharmaceutical companies all the time and they learn about what we are doing -- and they literally employ it on a Friday,"" he said. Reflecting on the Nobel Prize, he said: ""It's one of those weird moments in life when you have to sit about and think about all the people who got you here, and (it) makes you very sentimental."" Some scientists had suggested the rapid development of mRNA (Messenger ribonucleic acid) COVID-19 vaccines would be recognised this year, also possibly in the medicine category, which was awarded for discoveries on the sense of touch. ""This is an extremely important topic we?�re thinking about, but there will be more years, more Nobel prizes,"" said Pernilla Wittung Stafshede of the Swedish Academy of Sciences. The prizes, for achievements in science, literature and peace, were created and funded in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.

science,Trio win physics Nobel for work deciphering chaotic climate," STOCKHOLM, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Japanese-born American Syukuro Manabe, German Klaus Hasselmann and Italian Giorgio Parisi won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for work that helps understand complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate. In a decision hailed by the U.N. weather agency as a sign of a consensus forming around man-made global warming, one half of the 10-million Swedish crown ($1.15 million) prize goes in equal parts to Manabe, 90, and Hasselmann, 89, for modelling earth?�s climate and reliably predicting global warming. The other half goes to Parisi for discovering in the early 1980s ""hidden rules"" behind seemingly random movements and swirls in gases or liquids that can also be applied to aspects of neuroscience, machine learning and starling flight formations. ""Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth?�s climate and how humanity influences it,"" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement.   ""Giorgio Parisi is rewarded for his revolutionary contributions to the theory of disordered materials and random processes."" Hasselmann, who is at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, told Reuters from his home that he did not want to wake up from what he described as a beautiful dream. ""I am retired, you know, and have been a bit lazy lately. I am happy about the honour. The research continues,"" he said. The Academy said Manabe, who works at Princeton University in the United States, had laid the foundation in the 1960s for today's understanding of Earth's climate after moving to the United States from Japan to continue his research. Interviewed by U.S. and Japanese journalists at his home, Manabe said he believed his award reflected the Academy?�s recognition of climate change, which he said will continue to intensify with more droughts, torrential rains, warming of land masses and melting of polar ice. ""Already, as you know, there are many phenomena showing climate change is happening,"" he said in Japanese. ""And I think that is the reason why the theme of climate change was selected for the award this time."" Asked in English how he would address climate change sceptics, he smiled and replied, ?�That problem is about a million times more difficult than understanding climate change. It is very mysterious to me.??Hasselmann, the Academy said, had developed models about 10 years later that became instrumental in proving that mankind's carbon dioxide emissions cause rising temperatures in the atmosphere. Parisi, who dialled into the media briefing announcing the winners, was asked for his message to world leaders due to meet for U.N. climate change talks in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31. ""I think it is very urgent that we take real and very strong decisions and we move at a very strong pace,"" said the 73-year-old Nobel laureate, who works at Sapienza University of Rome. Scientists have spent decades urging climate change action on an often reluctant society, Hasselmann said in a recording published on the Nobel Prize's website. ""It is just that people are not willing to accept the fact that they have to react now for something that will happen in a few years,"" he said. GLOBAL WARMING Work on Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the U.N. climate panel received the Peace Prize in 2007 for galvanizing international action against global warming. William Nordhaus won one half of the 2018 Economics prize for integrating climate change into the Western economic growth model. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is also seen as a strong contender for this year's Peace Prize, due to be announced from Oslo on Friday. ""Sceptics or deniers of scientific facts...are not so visible anymore and this climate science message has been heard,"" World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said of this year's award. Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week after Americans David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian won the prize for The Nobel prizes were created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901 with only a handful of interruptions, primarily due to the two world wars.

Giorgio Parisi, Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann won the physics gong for their work deciphering chaotic climate, while Benjamin List and David MacMillan received the chemistry accolade for developing a tool for molecule building. Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah, 72, on Wednesday became only the ""Abdulrazak Gurnah meets at least one of the criterion of a writer from a non-traditional cultural circle - a non-European with a colonial background, but he's no woman,"" said Anne-Marie Morhed, head of the Swedish Association of Female Academics. ""Two prizes remain, the Peace Prize and the Economy Prize. The (Norwegian) Nobel committee... still have a chance to honor a woman."" Exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and Greta Thunberg are at least two women The Norwegian Nobel Committee is led by a woman and the majority of the members are women. Ditto the previous committee: led by a woman and with a majority of women on it. There has also been a real push in recent years to not give the prize to only white men from North America and Western Europe, as was the case in the earlier decades. In comparison to the dozen Black peace laureates in the Nobel's history, there has never been a Black recipient of the prizes for medicine, chemistry and physics, points out Professor Winston Morgan, a toxicologist at the University of East London who has looked at representation in the prizes as part of his research on inequality in the sciences. ""In terms of the gap between the world's population and the winners - the biggest gap is a gender one,"" Morgan said. ""The number of female prize winners is really, really tiny."" Scientists of both genders have already taken to social media to decry the lack of women recognized so far this year. GenderAvenger, a non-profit group dedicated to advancing women's voices in public dialog, Some, including Ellie Murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health, Nobel watchers, however, said it was entirely likely that Kariko and Corbett ""The issue for the Nobel prize is it has a criteria and a tradition and it is hard for them to break away from that,"" Morgan said, adding that the committee would likely respond to scientific innovation during the pandemic in three or four years. He added that if you looked at the general trajectory of Nobel prize winners, the number of women scientists was growing as were those given to men from Japan and China. ""We are not seeing that same trajectory for Black scientists. That concerns me more,"" he said. ""You need to ask are there enough black scientists in universities and are they being supported."" Asked why there were so few Black Nobel Prize winners for literature, Gurnah told Reuters the world was changing. Jesper Haeggstrom, chairman of the Nobel Assembly that awarded the prize in Physiology or Medicine, said there was no simple explanation for the lack of female prize winners, but that it reflected the representation of women in science. ""There has been an under-representation of women historically in science, so the further back in time you look, the fewer female candidates there are,"" he said. Haeggstrom declined to say whether gender played a role in the committee's selection process. ""I'm not at liberty to give you any details on this, but in general terms, I can say that scientific competence is the deciding factor,"" he said. Critics, however, point to the makeup of the scientific selection committees. Only 25% of the 50 professors on the medicine selection committee are women. The Committee for Physics at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences consists of six members, of which one is a woman, and two co-opted members, both men. The chemistry committee consists of six members, all male, and two co-opted members, both women.

science,Ancient Indonesian woman reshapes views on spread of early humans," MAROS, Indonesia, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Genetic traces in the body of a young woman who died 7,000 years ago furnish the first clue that mixing between early humans in Indonesia and those from faraway Siberia took place much earlier than previously thought. Theories about early human migration in Asia could be transformed by the ""There is the possibility that the Wallacea region could have been a meeting point of two human species, between the Denisovans and early homo sapiens,"" said Basran Burhan, an archaeologist from Australia's Griffith University. Burhan, one of the scientists who participated in the research, was referring to the region of Indonesia that includes South Sulawesi, where the body, buried with rocks in its hands and on the pelvis, was found in the Leang Pannige cave complexes. The Denisovans were a group of ancient humans named after a cave in Siberia where their remains were first identified in 2010 and scientists understand little about them, even details of their appearance. The DNA from Besse, as the researchers named the young woman in Indonesia, using the term for a new born baby girl in the regional Bugis language, is one of the few well-preserved specimens found in the tropics. It showed she descended from the Austronesian people common to Southeast Asia and Oceania but with the inclusion of a small Denisovan portion, the scientists said. ""Genetic analyses show that this pre-Neolithic forager... represents a previously unknown divergent human lineage,"" they said in the paper. Since scientists have until recently thought North Asian people such as the Denisovans only arrived in Southeast Asia about 3,500 years ago, Besse's DNA changes theories about patterns of early human migration. The discovery may also offer insights into the origins of Papuans and Indigenous Australian people who share Denisovan DNA. ""Theories about migration will change, as theories about race will also change,"" said Iwan Sumantri, a lecturer at Hasanuddin University in South Sulawesi, who is also involved in the project. Besse's remains provide the first sign of Denisovans among Austronesians, who are Indonesia's oldest ethnic grouping, he added. ""Now try to imagine how they spread and distributed their genes for it to reach Indonesia,"" Sumantri said.

science,Russian actor blasts off to attempt a world first: a movie in space," MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Russian actress and a film director blasted off for the International Space Station on Tuesday, beating Tom Cruise in the race to shoot the first movie in space. The Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft is set to dock at 1212 GMT at the station, which orbits Earth at an altitude of around 220 miles (354 km). Russian state media provided blanket and patriotic coverage in the run-up, with a countdown clock running on Channel One and news anchors framing the development as a significant breakthrough by Russia that the rest of the world is watching closely. The launch to film the movie ""The challenge"" puts Russia on course to beat the United States in the latest chapter of the space race. Actress Yulia Peresild and director Klim Shipenko will reach the cosmos ahead of Cruise, whose plans to blast off on a SpaceX rocket for an as-yet-untitled Hollywood film were announced by NASA last year. Russia's own space industry has in recent years been dogged by delays, accidents and corruption scandals, while U.S.-based private firms backed by rich businessmen such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have developed new spaceships. Peresild and Shipenko were accompanied at the launch of their 12-day mission by two Russian cosmonauts. Russian competition with the United States in space was a hallmark of the Cold War. Moscow launched the first satellite and put the first man and woman in space, but NASA beat it to the Moon landing. More recently, they have cooperated aboard the ISS, where cosmonauts and astronauts have lived side by side for decades. ""Space is where we became pioneers and we still maintain a confident lead despite everything,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after the launch. ""Yes, others are stepping on (our) toes but it is obvious that there is competition in a good sense. For our country, a flight like this, that popularises our achievements and the theme of space in general, is good news."" In the film, Peresild plays a doctor who is asked to travel to the space station to save a cosmonaut's life. Cosmonaut crew members are also set to appear. Director Klim Shipenko, whose height of 1.9 metres (6 feet 2 inches) makes the flight in a small capsule especially challenging, has already said he is looking forward to a Mars-based sequel.

science,Robots give Greece's postal service speed boost," ATHENS, Oct 5 (Reuters) - There's a new addition to Greece's postal service: a fleet of yellow robots sorting through the mail. Fifty-five small, four-wheeled autonomous mobile robots -- or AMR's -- powered by artificial intelligence, glide around Hellenic Post's sorting centre in Athens, speeding up an often arduous process. They scan the postal code, weigh the package and, directed by sensors, empty it into the corresponding mail sacks set up around a platform. The robots are part of the state-owned company's digital restructuring programme, which aims to tackle growing numbers of parcels from online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Until recently, sorting has been carried out by manual labour with a high demand in time, often with errors occurring, causing delivery delays for our customers and increased costs for the company,"" Hellenic Post Chief Executive George Constantopoulos told Reuters. Up to 80% of parcel sorting has been handed over to the robots and Constantopoulos said the process was up to three times faster, ensuring next-day delivery. The robots can handle as many as 168,000 parcels weighing up to 15 kg a day and only need to be recharged every four hours for 5 minutes.

Their work, carried out independently, has helped show how humans convert the physical impact from heat or touch into nerve impulses that allow us to ""perceive and adapt to the world around us,"" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said. ""This knowledge is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of disease conditions, including chronic pain."" Patapoutian, who was born in 1967 to Armenian parents in Lebanon and moved to Los Angeles in his youth, learnt of the news from his father as he had been out of contact by phone. ""In science many times it is the things we take for granted that are of high interest,"" he said of winning the more than century-old prize, which is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.15 million). He is credited for finding the celular mechanism and the underlying gene that translates a mechanical force on our skin into an electric nerve signal. ""(For) us being in the field of sense, touch and pain, this was the big elephant in room where we knew they existed, we knew they did something very different,"" he said. Patapoutian is a professor at Scripps Research, La Jolla, California, having previously done research at the University of California, San Francisco, and California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. New York-born Julius, 65, is a Professor at University of California, San Francisco (UCFS), after earlier work at Columbia University, in New York. His findings were inspired by his fascination for how natural products can be used to probe biological function and he used capsaicin, the molecule that makes chili peppers spicy by simulating a false sensation of heat, to understand the skin's sense of temperature. Julius hopes his work will help identify new strategies for treating chronic pain syndromes. ""We all know there's a real lack of drugs and approaches to treat chronic pain,"" Julius said in a 2017 video posted on Youtube by UCSF. ""I think we need some new insights and new ideas for treating pain, pharmacologically and other ways, and I think our work will contribute to that."" Jan Adams, chief science officer at German drugmaker Gruenenthal GmbH, which markets pain relief skin patches and creams based on the TRPV1 capsaicin receptor discovered by Julius, said his work had ""opened up a whole new field of research for new non-opioid pain therapies"".

Shatner, best known as Captain Kirk in the original ""Star Trek"" television series, will be part of a four-person crew aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard launch vehicle on the flight scheduled for the morning of Oct. 12, the company said on Monday. ""I've heard about space for a long time now,"" Shatner, 90, said in a statement released by Blue Origin.""I'm taking the opportunity to see it for myself. What a miracle."" In July, Bezos, the founder of Amazon, soared about 66.5 miles (107 km) above the Texas desert aboard a New Shepard launch vehicle and returned safely to Earth. Blue Origin said pioneering woman aviator Wally Funk, 82, was the oldest person to reach space when she joined Bezos on the July flight. Shatner is set to break that record. The actor is flying as a guest of Blue Origin, but the company says it has also sold nearly $100 million in tickets to paying customers, though it has not said how many. Shatner will be joined by Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer; Glen de Vries, a clinical research entrepreneur; and Audrey Powers, a Blue Origin vice president and engineer. It was not immediately clear whether they were ""Star Trek"" fans. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000. New Shepard hurtled at speeds reaching 2,233 miles (3,595 km) per hour, exceeding the KarmanLine - 62 miles (100 km) straight up - set by an international aeronautics body to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space. Shatner first played the role of Captain James T. Kirk in 1966 in a television franchise that many NASA astronauts credited with igniting their love of space. He also played the role in seven feature films. On Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would review safety concerns raised by current and former Blue Origin employees who said the company ""often prioritizes execution speed and cost reduction over the appropriate resourcing to ensure quality.""

science,"England's Isle of Wight was Isle of Fright, with two big dinosaur predators"," Sept 29 (Reuters) - Fossils found on a rocky beach show there was double trouble on England's Isle of Wight about 127 million years ago, with a pair of large previously unknown dinosaur predators living perhaps side by side, both adapted to hunting along the water's edge. Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of fossils of the two Cretaceous Period meat-eaters - both measuring about 30 feet long (9 meters) and boasting elongated crocodile-like skulls - on the southwest of the island, one of Europe's richest locales for dinosaur remains. They are examples of a type of dinosaur called a spinosaur, known for long and narrow skulls with lots of conical teeth - perfect for grasping slippery fish - as well as strong arms and big claws. One is named Ceratosuchops inferodios, meaning ""horned crocodile-faced hell heron."" The name refers to a heron because of that bird's shoreline-foraging lifestyle. Ceratosuchops had a series of low horns and bumps ornamenting its brow region. The second is named Riparovenator milnerae, meaning ""Milner's riverbank hunter,"" honoring British paleontologist Angela Milner, who died in August. It may have been slightly larger than Ceratosuchops. Each are estimated to have weighed around one to two tons, with skulls around a yard long, according to Chris Barker, a University of Southampton PhD student in paleontology and lead author of the study published in the journal Scientific Reports. ""Both would have been heron-like shoreline hunters, wading out into water and thrusting the head down quickly to grab things like fish, small turtles, et cetera, and on land would do something similar, grabbing baby dinosaurs or the like. They would basically have eaten anything small they could grab,"" said paleontologist and study co-author David Hone of Queen Mary University of London. Spinosaurs were part of the broad group of bipedal meat-eating dinosaurs called theropods that included the likes of Ceratosuchops and Riparovenator roamed a floodplain environment bathed in a subtropical Mediterranean-like climate. Forest fires occasionally ravaged the landscape, with fossils of burned wood found throughout Isle of Wight cliffs. With a large river and other bodies of water attracting plant-eating dinosaurs and hosting numerous bony fish, sharks and crocodiles, the habitat provided Ceratosuchops and Riparovenator plenty of hunting opportunities, Barker said. These two cousins may have lived at the same time, perhaps differing in prey preference, or may have been separated a bit in time, the researchers said. There was a third roughly contemporaneous spinosaur named Baryonyx, whose fossils were unearthed in the 1980s, that lived nearby and was about the same size, maybe slightly smaller. Partial remains of Ceratosuchops and Riparovenator were discovered near the town of Brighstone. Ceratosuchops is known from skull material, while Riparovenator is known from both skull and tail material. There are braincase remains for both, giving particular insight into these creatures. The fossils helped the scientists produce a family tree of spinosaurs, indicating the lineage originated in Europe before moving into Africa, Asia and South America, according to University of Southampton paleobiologist Neil Gostling, who supervised the research project. The largest one, Spinosaurus, reached 50 feet (15 meters) long and lived in North Africa roughly 95 million years ago. It differed from its Isle of Wight forerunners, boasting a large sail-like structure on its back and adaptations for a more aquatic lifestyle.

science,Coronavirus can transform pancreas cell function; certain genes may protect an infected person's spouse," Sept 29 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Coronavirus transforms pancreas cell function When the coronavirus infects cells, it not only impairs their activity but can also change their function, new findings suggest. For example, when insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas become infected with the virus, they not only produce much less insulin than usual, but also start to produce glucose and digestive enzymes, which is not their job, researchers found. ""We call this a change of cell fate,"" said study leader Dr. Shuibing Chen, who described the work in a presentation on Tuesday at the Certain genes may protect an infected patient's spouse A study of couples in which both partners were exposed to the coronavirus but only one person got infected is helping to shed light on why some people may be naturally resistant to the virus. The researchers had believed such cases were rare, but a call for volunteers who fit that profile turned up roughly a thousand couples. Ultimately, they took blood samples from 86 couples for detailed analysis. The results suggest resistant partners more often have genes that contribute to more efficient activation of so-called natural killer (NK) cells, which are part of the immune system's initial response to germs.

science,U.S. extends environmental review for SpaceX program in Texas," WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday it would extend the public comment period for the draft environmental review of the proposed SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy program in Boca Chica, Texas, to Nov. 1. The extension comes after federal and state agencies participating in the review made the request to extend the period for public input in the environmental assessment. SpaceX, the space company led by Elon Musk cannot launch the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle until the FAA completes its licensing process, which includes the environmental review.

science,China to launch rocket in 2028 capable of sending crewed probe to moon," ZHUHAI, China, Sept 29 (Reuters) - China is expected to launch its next generation of heavy-duty rockets in 2028 powerful enough to send a crewed spacecraft to the moon, the country's main space contractor said on Wednesday. The new heavy-lift launch vehicle would be capable of putting a 15- to 50-tonne spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon, said Liu Bing, deputy designer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology. It would also be powerful enough to place a probe weighing 12 to 44 tonnes on a trajectory to Mars, Liu told reporters at a major airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, without naming the rocket. China previously predicted it would complete the design and construction of a rocket with enough thrust to transport its astronauts to the moon only by 2030. China still lags behind the United States in experience and technology. The last NASA crewed landing was in 1972 and U.S. astronauts are expected to return to the moon by 2024. China has been developing the super-heavy Long March 9 rocket with a liftoff weight of 4,140 tonnes and a thrust of 5,760 tonnes, state media reported in May. That compares with the takeoff mass of the Long March 5 - currently China's biggest rocket - of about 849 tonnes and thrust of about 1,078 tonnes. The Long March 9 would be able to place a 25-tonne spacecraft on a course to the moon, Chinese scientists said previously. China has also set its sights on a Mars sample-return mission around 2030.

science,Explainer: Scientists come closer to solving Caribbean seaweed mystery," Sept 29 (Reuters) - Scientists were baffled A group of U.S. researchers has fingered a prime suspect: human sewage and agricultural runoff carried by rivers to the ocean. The science is not yet definitive. This nutrient-charged outflow is just one of several likely culprits fueling an explosion of seaweed in warm waters of the Americas. Six scientists told Reuters they suspect a complex mix of climate change, Amazon rainforest destruction and dust blowing west from Africa's Sahara Desert may be fueling mega-blooms of the dark-brown seaweed known as sargassum. In June 2018, scientists recorded 20 million metric tons of seaweed, a 1,000% increase compared with the 2011 bloom for that month. ""There are probably multiple factors"" driving the growth, said oceanographer Ajit Subramaniam at Columbia University. ""I would be surprised if there is one clear villain."" Still, a recent study examining the chemistry of seaweed from the 1980s up to 2019 offers the strongest evidence yet that water coming from city and farm runoff has been a major contributor to expansion of the so-called Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, which now stretches for nearly 9,000 kilometers. NITROGEN RUNOFF That study, co-authored by biologist Brian Lapointe at Florida Atlantic University, found that sargassum collected recently in coastal waters from Brazil to the southern United States, and including several Caribbean nations, contained levels of nitrogen that were 35% higher on average than in samples taken more than three decades earlier. The findings were published in May in the journal Nature Communications. Nitrogen is found in human and animal waste and in fertilizers. The results suggest that sewage and farm runoff that's flowing into rivers throughout the Americas and then on to the ocean is feeding offshore sargassum growth. Currents carry much of this seaweed to the Caribbean Sea, where it's bedeviling the region's tourism-dependent coastal economies. The samples also showed, for example, a 111% rise in the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus during the same time frame. That ratio has been nearly constant across the world's oceans going back decades. The change suggests the water chemistry has been radically altered. The researchers singled out the Amazon River for particular scrutiny. CLIMATE CHANGE As global temperatures rise, scientists believe that rainstorms are intensifying in certain areas of the globe, including over the Amazon. Those storms are increasing the frequency of extreme flooding, which likely is pushing more nitrogen-rich runoff out to sea, Lapointe told Reuters, in a sequence he calls ""a double whammy."" Experts note that peak Amazon River flooding pushes a plume of nutrients hundreds of kilometers out to sea in March and April, coinciding with major sargassum blooms. From there, currents push the seaweed around the coast of Venezuela into the Caribbean Sea and sometimes even farther north into the Gulf of Mexico. Climate change is also fueling stronger hurricanes, which at sea are pulling more nutrients up from the seabed to potentially fertilize sargassum. AFRICAN DUST AND ASH Scientists have also theorized that dust from the Sahara Desert, along with smoke and ash, could be contributing to the seaweed boom. As the particles are blown westward over the Atlantic Ocean, they run into clouds and get rained down as fertilizing iron and phosphorus deposits in the water. Proving exactly how much each of these factors might be contributing to sargassum's growth will take years of funding and research. But scientists say that doesn't mean governments can't act now to reverse the trend. ""This phenomenon will continue until there is a change in public policy,"" said Carlos Noriega, an oceanographer at Brazil's Federal University of Pernambuco. Brazil, for example, could slow deforestation, which has led to a boom in cattle ranching that allows loose soil, manure and fertilizer to wash into rivers. He also noted the burgeoning human population in Brazil's Amazon region. The five largest cities there have grown by nearly 900,000 people since 2010, and much of the region lacks sufficient sewage treatment. ""Treating sewage and stopping deforestation, that's the only way to control it,"" Noriega said.

science,England to ease regulations on gene editing in agricultural research," LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Britain's farming and environment minister George Eustice announced on Wednesday that regulations related to gene editing in agricultural research would be eased in England following a public consultation. Rules will now largely be aligned with conventional breeding methods for research and development into plants although scientists will still be required to notify the government of any research trials. ""It is a tool that could help us in order to tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face ??around food security, climate change and biodiversity loss,"" Eustice said in a statement announcing the relaxation. The technology has faced the same stringent rules which apply to research that involves genetic modification. Gene editing is different from genetic modification (GM), as it does not result in the introduction of DNA from other species. Proponents argue gene editing can be seen as equivalent to conventional breeding but many times faster. Opponents, however, believe the technology will be used to further corporate interests rather than tackling the underlying problems faced by agriculture which include a lack of crop diversity and the decline of beneficial insects. ""Changing the DNA of crops and animals to make them temporarily immune to disease is not a long-term solution; we should be investing in solutions that deal with the cause of disease and pests in the first place,"" said Joanna Lewis, director of policy and strategy at the Soil Association. The change in rules will not apply to the marketing of plants to consumers with both gene editing and genetic modification still subject to the same rules although a further review is planned. The European Union applies the same rules to both gene editing and genetic modification although the European Commission has launched a review which could open the door to a possible loosening of restrictions for gene edited plants. The change just applies to England as agriculture is devolved within the United Kingdom and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own rules.

science,Good friends and fresh blood: the social life of a vampire bat," WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - When one thinks of vampire bats, friendship and cooperation may not be among the qualities that come to mind for these blood-feasting creatures of the night. But maybe they should. Scientists on Thursday provided a deeper understanding of social relationships among vampire bats, showing how those that have forged bonds akin to ""friendships"" with others will rendezvous with these buddies while foraging for a meal. Researchers attached small devices to 50 vampire bats to track nighttime foraging in Panama, when these flying mammals drink blood from wounds they inflict upon cattle in pastures. The study involved female bats, known to have stronger social relationships than males. Among the bats were 23 wild-born individuals that had been kept in captivity for about two years during related research into bat social behavior. Social bonds already had been observed among some of them. After being released back into the wild, the bats were found to often join a ""friend"" during foraging, possibly coordinating the hunt. ""Each bat maintains its own network of close cooperative social bonds,"" said behavioral ecologist Gerald Carter of the Ohio State University and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, who led the research published in the journal PLoS Biology. Social bonds among vampire bats as they roost in trees include grooming one another and regurgitating blood meals for hungry pals. The study showed that the social bonds formed in roosts extended into the hunt. ""This study opens up an exciting new window into the social lives of these animals,"" Carter said. The researchers suspect that the bats, while almost never departing on foraging forays with their ""friends,"" link up with them during the hunt - perhaps even recognizing one another's vocalizations - for mutual benefit. They hypothesize the bats might exchange information about prey location or access to an open wound for feeding. Vampire bats, which inhabit warmer regions of Latin America and boast wingspans of about 7 inches (18 cm), are the only mammals with a blood-only diet. They reside in colonies ranging from tens to thousands of individuals. ""People's first reaction to vampire bats is usually, 'Uh, scary.' But once you tell them about their complex social lives, they are quite surprised that we can find such behavior that is somewhat similar to what humans do - and which one would maybe expect in primates - in bats,"" said study co-author Simon Ripperger, a Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute post-doctoral researcher. Ripperger called them ""amazing creatures"" for several reasons. ""Even besides their social lives, vampire bats are quite special: specializing in a diet of 100% blood is already quite rare among vertebrates,"" Ripperger said. ""They are amazing runners, which you wouldn't expect in a bat. They have heat sensors in their snouts that help them find a spot to make a bite. They have a protein in their saliva that prevents blood from coagulation, which is actually being used in medical trials to help prevent blood clots in patients who suffered a stroke."" The bats attack prey from the ground, using their sharp teeth to open a wound, lapping up blood with their tongues. Carter said there is reason to fear vampire bats because they can transmit rabies to livestock and people. ""But I do think they are beautiful and interesting animals in their own right,"" Carter added. ""In this way they are a bit like grizzly bears, sharks, rats and venomous snakes: animals that might not help people in any way and might even endanger them, but should still be appreciated for their own sake.""

science,Little fluffy clouds may help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef," SYDNEY, Sept 28 (Reuters) - To slow the speed at which high temperatures and warm waters bleach the corals of the Great Barrier Reef, Australian scientists are spraying droplets of ocean water into the sky to form clouds to protect the environmental treasure. Researchers working on the so-called Cloud Brightening project said they use a turbine to spray microscopic sea particles to thicken existing clouds and reduce sunlight on the world's largest coral reef ecosystem located off Australia's northeast coast. The water droplets evaporate leaving only tiny salt crystals which float up into the atmosphere allowing water vapour to condense around them, forming clouds, said Daniel Harrison, a senior lecturer at Southern Cross University, who runs the project. ""If we do it over an extended period of time for a few weeks to a couple of months when the corals are experiencing a marine heatwave we can actually start to lower the water temperature over the Reef,"" said Harrison. The project had its second trial in March, the end of the Southern Hemisphere summer when the Reef off Australia's northeast is at its hottest, gathering valuable data on the atmosphere when corals are at most risk of bleaching. A combination of light and warm water causes coral bleaching. By cutting light over the reef by 6% in summer, ""bleaching stress"" would be cut by 50% to 60% on the undersea ecosystem, Harrison said. But the benefits of cloud brightening would lessen over time unless other measures slowed the march of climate change. ""If we do have really strong action on climate change then the modelling shows that the cloud brightening is enough to stop the reef declining and to actually see it through this period while we reduce our carbon emissions,"" he said. One of Australia's best-known natural attractions, the Reef came close to being listed as an endangered World Heritage Site by the United Nations, although it avoided the designation following lobbying by Australia.

science,AstraZeneca invests in Imperial's self-amplifying RNA technology with eye on future drugs," LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc Under the deal, VaxEquity, a startup founded by Imperial vaccinologist Robin Shattock, could receive up to $195 million if certain milestones are met, in addition to royalties on approved drugs and equity investment from AstraZeneca and life sciences investor Morningside Ventures. AstraZeneca already produces an adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine, and emphasised the potential of the self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) technology in novel therapeutic programmes beyond the coronavirus pandemic. ""This collaboration with VaxEquity adds a promising new platform to our drug discovery toolbox,"" said AstraZeneca research chief Mene Pangalos. The technology works in a similar way to the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech However, a self-amplifying RNA vaccine not only encodes the instructions for the host cell to make a coronavirus protein, but makes lots of copies of the RNA containing those instructions, meaning doses can be smaller and cheaper. ""It's a bit like having a manufacturing facility, and instead of having one copy of the recipe, you have multiple copies that you can hand round to multiple production lines within the cell to produce more protein,"" Imperial's Shattock told Reuters. ""So that's why it has that opportunity to use lower doses."" Imperial's COVID-19 vaccine is being retooled to produce a more consistent immune response with an eye on future coronavirus variants. AstraZeneca, under the deal, has the option to collaborate on 26 drug targets for use against other therapeutic areas like cancers and rare genetic diseases. ""We believe self-amplifying RNA, once optimised, will allow us to target novel pathways not amenable to traditional drug discovery across our therapy areas of interest,"" Pangalos said.

Researchers found that patients infected with the Alpha variant of the virus - the dominant strain circulating when the study was conducted - put 43 to 100 times more virus into the air than people infected with the original version of the coronavirus. Some of this was due to the fact that patients infected with Alpha had increased amounts of virus in nasal swabs and saliva.

The reorganization, announced by NASA chief Bill Nelson on Tuesday, reflects an evolving relationship between private companies, such as SpaceX, that have increasingly commercialized rocket travel and the federal agency that had exercised a U.S. monopoly over spaceflight for decades. Nelson said the shake-up was also spurred by a recent proliferation of flights and commercial investment in low-Earth orbit even as NASA steps up its development of deep-space aspirations. ""Today is more than organizational change,"" Nelson said at a press briefing. ""It's setting the stage for the next 20 years, it's defining NASA's future in a growing space economy."" The move breaks up NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, currently headed by Kathy Leuders, into two separate branches. Leuders will keep her associate administrator title as head of the new Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, focusing on NASA's most ambitious, long-term programs, such as plans to return astronauts to the moon under project Artemis, and eventual human exploration of Mars. A retired deputy associate administrator, James Free, who played key roles in NASA's space station and commercial crew and cargo programs, will return to the agency as head of the new Space Operations Mission Directorate. His branch will primarily oversee more routine launch and spaceflight activities, including missions involving the space station and privatization of low-Earth orbit, as well as sustaining lunar operations once those have been established.

science,EXCLUSIVE Polish gene project moves to drop Chinese tech on data concerns," WARSAW, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A European Union-funded project to build a genomic map of Poland plans to drop gene-sequencing technology from China's BGI Group The Genomic Map of Poland's concerns stem from questions over how Polish genomic data may be used that relate to national security, said Marek Figlerowicz, a Professor at the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry at the Polish Academy of Sciences who steers the project. Figlerowicz said the concerns were initially raised by a BGI told Reuters in response that the U.S. report was ""disinformation, not borne out by the facts;"" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called it ""groundless accusations and smears."" An NSCAI spokesperson said it stood by its report, and has recommended the United States and allies double-down on techniques to better protect patient privacy. Since 2015, Beijing has restricted foreign researchers from accessing gene data on Chinese people. In August, a human genetics committee at the Polish Academy of Sciences said a ""lack of compliance"" by what it called ""Far East companies"" with the principles of genetic testing ethics raised serious doubts. It did not name any companies or countries but urged labs and scientific institutions that sequence genetic material abroad to stop using biotechnology companies there. It said about 100,000 complete Polish genomes may already be in ""Far Eastern"" laboratories, citing a rough estimate which Reuters could not verify. Poland has no control over that sensitive personal data, the committee said. Figlerowicz said the Genomic Map, which is expected to cost over 100 million zlotys ($25.35 million) and is about halfway through its programme of sequencing 5,000 Polish genomes, has outsourced the work to a third party since 2019. That company, Bialystok-based Central Europe Genomics Center sp. z o.o. (CEGC), started using BGI's technology last year, he said; now Figlerowicz said the Genomic Map of Poland had decided not to send any genetic data out of the country and is likely to cancel the contract it has with CEGC. He added that the final decision, still to be approved by the funding institutions, is expected within the next week or two. As the technology to sequence genetic data has advanced and become cheaper, Figlerowicz said, the mapping project plans to bring the remaining sequencing in-house. The project wants to ensure Poland has genomic ""independence"" so it can ensure data security. CEGC did not respond to requests for comment. Poznan-based biotech company Inno-Gene S.A., which holds a minority stake in CEGC, said it did not know of a possible cancellation. The European Union, which provided about 65% of the total funding for the Genomic Map, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Poland's Ministry of Education and National Information Processing Institute, also involved with funding the project. Poland's special services declined to comment.

BGI rejects any suggestion that it developed the test, branded NIFTY, in collaboration with the military, and says working with military hospitals is not equivalent. ""BGI takes all aspects of data protection, privacy and ethics extremely seriously,"" the company said in a statement on the Polish decision, adding it complies with all applicable data protection laws and regulations.

""We wanted to solve some problems for our society by making a taxi drone and... inventing drones for firefighters,"" he said, noting how, for example, they hoped it could reach the upper floors of a building to bring a hose where a fire truck could not reach. The prototype can carry a pilot weighing up to 60 kg (132 pounds) and fly for about 10 minutes for a distance of 1 km (0.6 miles). It took three years of research and development and cost around $20,000 to build. While the team hopes it will eventually fly far higher, when manned the drone currently only rises to as much as 4 metres (13.1 feet). The project faced delays because of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and also as components like the propellers and the frame had to be ordered abroad, said Sarin Sereyvatha, who is NPIC's head of research and development technology. The team plans to improve the design to allow it to take more weight, as well as fly further and more stably at a higher level. ""In principle, if we make one drone, the cost is expensive but if we make them to sell on the market, the cost will go down,"" said Sarin Sereyvatha.

science,"We must take the game to Chelsea, says Juve's Allegri"," TURIN, Italy, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said his team will be punished if they sit back in their Champions League clash with holders Chelsea in Turin on Wednesday as he called for his side to take the game to their opponents. Juve have endured a difficult start to the season after failing to win any of their opening four league games for the first time in 60 years, and come into the match against Chelsea with several injuries. They did get off to a winning start in the Champions League against Malmo two weeks ago, while Allegri's men also earned victories in their last two Serie A matches. The Juve coach hopes that will give his side a boost ahead of Wednesday's encounter. ""You need to apply pressure but you have to play well,"" Allegri told a news conference. ""You can't play 95 minutes under pressure. When you have the ball you have to breathe to build and recover immediately. ""They are strong on the counter attack, they are strong in dead balls. It will be difficult to find gaps and we will have to be good all over the pitch. ""We will need patience, but we will have to have fun. We have improved in recent games. The emotion is natural. In front of us we have a team where if you make mistakes, you are punished."" Without the injured Paulo Dybala and Alvaro Morata, Allegri said he has no other option but to deploy Moise Kean in the lone striker role. ""He (Kean) has to play and score,"" Allegri added. ""One thing he knows how to do well is scoring. He has to improve when he has to play with the team, in terms of individual technique."" Speaking at the same news conference, defender Giorgio Chiellini insisted no extra motivation was needed ahead of such blockbuster European encounters.

A Long March-7 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-3, or ""Heavenly Vessel"" in Chinese, blasted off at 3:10 p.m. Beijing time (0710 GMT) from the Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan, state media reported. It successfully docked with the core Tianhe module of the space station at 1408 GMT. Tianzhou-3 will deliver fuel and supplies for three astronauts due to travel to the Tianhe module in October. Their planned six-month stay would be the fifth mission in the series and the last for this year. Next year, China will launch two additional core modules for the space station - Wentian and Mengtian - on Long March 5B rockets - China's most powerful space transport vehicles.

science,Genetic study reveals how ancient seafarers settled vast Polynesia," WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Beginning more than a millennium ago, intrepid seafarers traversed vast Pacific Ocean expanses in double-hulled sailing canoes to reach the far-flung islands of Polynesia, the planet's last habitable region to be settled by people. A genetic study published on Wednesday has deciphered the timing and sequence of this settlement of an area spanning about a third of Earth's surface, with Samoa as the starting point while Rapa Nui, also called Easter Island, and other locales known for megalithic statues were among the last to be reached. ""Many of the distances were immense,"" said Stanford University computational geneticist Alexander Ioannidis, lead author of the research appearing in the journal Nature. For example, the study found that Rapa Nui was settled in about 1210 AD after an open-sea voyage covering roughly 1,600 miles (2,575 km). Historians believe that family groups of perhaps 30 to 200 people sailed at a time aboard double-hulled canoes that operated similarly to modern catamarans and used a lateen, or triangular, sail. Genomic data from 430 modern-day people from 21 Pacific island populations helped unravel Polynesia's genetic history. ""Each living individual retains a genetic record of all the ancestors from whom they inherited their DNA, so by analyzing together hundreds of individuals we can create a genomic network where connections, splitting patterns and dates can be inferred,"" said geneticist and study co-author Andres Moreno-Estrada of Mexico's CINVESTAV network of research centers. The first voyages were found to have been from Samoa to Fiji and Tonga and then to Rarotonga in the Cook Islands in the 9th century AD. In the 11th century, the islands of Totaiete ma (Society Islands) were next, followed in the 12th century by Tuha'a Pae (Austral Islands) and the Tuamotu Archipelago. Eventually in the 12th and 13th centuries seafarers from Mangareva in the Gambier Islands reached Te Henua 'Enana (Marquesas Islands), Rapa Nui and Raivavae - places where megaliths like Rapa Nui's monumental head-and-torso stone statues, known as moai, were created. ""It is one of the most impressive and fascinating chapters of human expansion and long-distance exploration,"" Moreno-Estrada said. There has been an ongoing debate based on archeological remains as to when the Polynesian islands were settled. ""Unraveling these histories is not only a fascinating challenge, but also an incredible demonstration that modern populations are still connected physically to their ancestors' stories,"" Ioannidis said. Navigation may have involved following the paths of long-distance seabirds as well as guidance from the stars, winds, weather, ocean currents and water patterns caused by islands and atolls. The voyagers brought with them crops like the root vegetable taro and food sources such as chickens. ""These were initially voyages into the unknown, and it is believed that Polynesians would sail upwind so that if they were unable to find a new island they could return,"" Ioannidis added. Polynesians established sophisticated artistic and cultural traditions in carving, boat ornamentation, religious and social rules, the practice of tattooing and, in Rapa Nui, North Marquesas, South Marquesas and Raivavae, megalithic statues. The people of the megalith islands were found to be genetically connected, settled from a common Tuamotu origin. ""The discovery of a common genetic source for people on the eastern islands where megalithic sites have been found is not an intuitive connection given how distant and widely dispersed these group of islands are,"" Moreno-Estrada said. The researchers dated those lengthy voyages close to the time when, as detailed in their genetic ""This suggests that when the maritime culture of the widely spread Tuamotu Archipelago was embarking on its longest voyages of discovery, which gave rise to widely dispersed monumental sculpture-building populations, it also made contact with the Americas,"" Ioannidis said. While Samoa was the springboard for remote Polynesia's settlement, the researchers called it merely an intermediate stop in a larger Pacific regional human expansion beginning in Taiwan around 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. It is believed Samoa was settled by around 800 BC.

science,Scientists in Singapore transform fruit leftovers into antibacterial bandages," Sept 20 (Reuters) - Scientists at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore are tackling food waste by turning discarded durian husks into antibacterial gel bandages. The process extracts cellulose powder from the fruit's husks after they are sliced and freeze-dried, then mixes it with glycerol. This mixture becomes soft hydrogel, which is then cut into bandage strips. ""In Singapore, we consume about 12 million durians a year, so besides the flesh, we can't do much about the husk and the seeds and this cause environmental pollution,"" said Professor William Chen, director of the food science and technology programme at NTU. The fruit's husks, which make up more than half of the composition of durians, are usually discarded and incinerated, contributing to environmental waste. Chen added that the technology can also turn other food waste, such as soy beans and spent grains, into hydrogel, helping limit the country's food waste. Compared to conventional bandages, the organo-hydrogel bandages are also able to keep wound areas cooler and moist, which can help accelerate healing. The researchers say using waste materials and yeast for the antimicrobial bandages is more cost effective than the production of conventional bandages, whose antimicrobial properties come from more expensive metallic compounds like silver or copper ions. A durian wholeseller, Tan Eng Chuan, said he goes through at least 30 crates of durians a day during durian season - as much as 1,800 kg. Being able to use the parts of the fruit that are ordinarily discarded, he said, was an innovation that would make enjoying it ""more sustainable"".

science,SpaceX capsule with world's first all-civilian orbital crew returns safely," Sept 18 (Reuters) - The quartet of newly minted citizen astronauts comprising the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission safely splashed down in the Atlantic off Florida's coast on Saturday, completing a three-day flight of the first all-civilian crew ever sent into Earth orbit. The successful launch and return of the mission, the latest in a recent string of rocket-powered expeditions bankrolled by their billionaire passengers, marked another milestone in the fledgling industry of commercial astro-tourism, 60 years after the dawn of human spaceflight. ""Welcome to the second space age,"" Todd ""Leif"" Ericson, mission director for the Inspiration4 venture, told reporters on a conference call after the crew returned. SpaceX, the private rocketry company founded by Tesla Inc The three-day mission ended as the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, parachuted into calm seas around 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), shortly before sunset, following an automated reentry descent, as shown during a live SpaceX webcast on its YouTube channel. Within an hour the four smiling crew members were seen emerging one by one from the capsule's side hatch after the vehicle, visibly scorched on its exterior, was hoisted from the ocean to the deck of a SpaceX recovery vessel. Each of SEARING REENTRY The return from orbit followed a plunge through Earth's atmosphere generating frictional heat that sent temperatures surrounding the outside of the capsule soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,900 degrees Celsius). The astronauts' flight suits, fitted to special ventilation systems, were designed to keep them cool if the cabin heated up. Applause was heard from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles as the first parachutes were seen deploying, slowing the capsule's descent to about 15 miles per hour (25 kph) before splashdown, with another round of cheers as the craft hit the water. The astronauts were cheered again as they stepped onto the deck of the recovery ship. First out was Hayely Arceneaux, 29, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children's Research Center in Tennessee, a childhood bone cancer survivor herself who became the youngest person ever reach Earth orbit on the Inspiration4 mission. She was followed in rapid succession by geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51, aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42, and finally the crew's billionaire benefactor and ""mission commander"" Jared Isaacman, 38. ""That was a heck of a ride for us,"" Isaacman, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc He had paid an undisclosed sum - put by Time magazine at roughly $200 million - to fellow billionaire Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon. The Inspiration4 team blasted off on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral atop one of SpaceX's  two-stage reusable Falcon 9 rockets. HIGHEST ORBIT SINCE APOLLO Within three hours the crew capsule had reached a cruising orbital altitude of 585 km, or just over 363 miles - higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972. It also marked the debut flight of Musk's new space tourism business and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to well-heeled customers willing to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of spaceflight and earn amateur astronaut wings. Musk's company already ranks as the best-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the space station for NASA. Two rival operators, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's three days in orbit. Isaacman conceived of Inspiration4 primarily to raise awareness and donations for St. Jude, one of his favorite causes, where Arceneaux now works. Ericson said the flight had so far raised $160 million for the cancer institute, including $100 million donated by Isaacman at the outset. The Inspiration4 crew had no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which was controlled by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, although Isaacman and Proctor are both licensed pilots. But Ericson insisted the crew had ""the same training and the same control and authority that NASA astronauts have"" to intervene in the Crew Dragon's operation in the event of an emergency. SpaceX's human-spaceflight chief, Benji Reed, marveled at how little went wrong during the flight, citing just two problems he described as minor and easily resolved - a malfunctioning fan in the crew's toilet system and a faulty temperature sensor on one of the spacecraft's engines. The level of ""space adaption syndrome"" experienced by the crew - vertigo and motion sickness while acclimating to a microgravity environment - was ""pretty much on target with what NASA astronauts do,"" Ericson said.

science,Cambodia bat researchers on mission to track origin of COVID-19," STUNG TRENG, Cambodia, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Researchers are collecting samples from bats in northern Cambodia in a bid to understand the coronavirus pandemic, returning to a region where a very similar virus was found in the animals a decade ago. Two samples from horseshoe bats were collected in 2010 in Stung Treng province near Laos and kept in freezers at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) in Phnom Penh. Tests done on them last year revealed a close relative to the coronavirus that has killed more than 4.6 million people worldwide. An eight-member IPC research team has been collecting samples from bats and logging their species, sex, age and other details for a week. ""We hope that the result from this study can help the world to have a better understanding about COVID-19,"" field coordinator Thavry Hoem told Reuters, as she held a net to catch bats. Host species such as bats typically display no symptoms of pathogens, but these can be Dr. Veasna Duong, Head of Virology at the IPC, said his institute had made four such trips in the past two years, hoping for clues about the origin and evolution of the bat-borne virus. ""We want to find out whether the virus is still there and ... to know how the virus has evolved,"" he told Reuters. Deadly viruses originating from bats include Ebola and other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). But Veasna Duong said humans were responsible for the devastation caused by COVID-19, due to interference and destruction of natural habitats. ""If we try to be near wildlife, the chances of getting the virus carried by wildlife are more than normal. The chances of the virus transforming to infect humans are also more,"" he said. The French-funded project also aims to look at how the wildlife trade could be playing a part, said Julia Guillebaud, a research engineer at the IPC's virology unit. ""(The project) aims to provide new knowledge on wild meat trade chains in Cambodia, document the diversity of betacoronaviruses circulating through these chains, and develop a flexible and integrated early-detection system of viral spill-over events,"" Gillebaud said.

science,Study rewrites understanding of modern Japan's genetic ancestry," Sept 17 (Reuters) - An analysis of ancient DNA is transforming the understanding of the genetic ancestry of Japan's modern-day population, identifying a crucial contribution from people who arrived about 1,700 years ago and helped revolutionize Japanese culture. Research published on Friday showed that the people of Japan bear genetic signatures from three ancient populations rather than just two as previously thought - a more complex ancestry for the archipelago nation of roughly 125 million. The researchers analyzed genetic information from 17 ancient Japanese people - DNA extracted from the bones of 12 specifically for this study and five done previously - and compared it to genomic data for modern Japanese people. Previously documented genetic contributions were confirmed from two ancient groups. The first was Japan's indigenous culture of hunter-gatherers dating to roughly 15,000 years ago, the start of what is called the Jomon period. The second was a population of Northeast Asian origins who arrived at about 900 BC, bringing wet-rice farming during the subsequent Yayoi period. Modern Japanese possess approximately 13% and 16% genetic ancestry from those two groups, respectively, the researchers determined. But 71% of their ancestry was found to come from a third ancient population with East Asian origins that arrived at roughly 300 AD to launch what is called the Kofun period, bringing various cultural advances and developing centralized leadership. These migrants appear to have had ancestry mainly  resembling the Han people who make up most of China's population. ""We are very excited about our findings on the tripartite structure of Japanese populations. This finding is significant in terms of rewriting the origins of modern Japanese by taking advantage of the power of ancient genomics,"" said geneticist Shigeki Nakagome of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, co-leader of the study published in the journal Science Advances. The research demonstrates the ability of ancient DNA to uncover new ancestral components that could not be seen using modern genetic data, added study co-leader Daniel Bradley, also of Trinity College Dublin. The study showed that people from Japan's ancient foraging, agrarian and state-formation cultural phases each provided a significant contribution to the ancestry of today's Japanese population, Nakagome said. The oldest of the skeletons from which DNA was extracted was a female dating to around 9,000 years ago from a Jomon period site in Ehime Prefecture, while the most recent were three skeletons from about 1,500 years ago from a Kofun period site in Ishikawa Prefecture, according to geneticist and study co-leader Takashi Gakuhari of Kanazawa University in Japan. The Kofun period is named after the large earthen tombs built for members of the new ruling class at a time of the importation of technology and culture from China by way of the Korean peninsula. ""Chinese characters started to be used in this period, such as Chinese characters inscribed on metal implements, for example swords,"" Nakagome said. Insularity was a byproduct of Japan's island geography, surrounded by oceans that made migration in ancient times difficult. The first people to reach Japan arrived more than 30,000 years ago at a time of lower sea levels when there may have been a land bridge to the Asian mainland. The researchers also said the genetics of Japan's population have remained largely stable since the Kofun period, which lasted from around 300-700 AD.

science,A ukulele in space? Inspiration4 crew shows a playful side in orbit," Sept 17 (Reuters) - A 42-year-old data engineer on the first all-civilian astronaut crew to reach orbit made some spaceflight history on Friday, with a zero-gravity ukulele performance in a SpaceX capsule hundreds of miles above Earth's surface. Chris Sembroski, a Lockheed Martin employee and U.S. Air Force veteran, strummed a few chords for home-bound viewers during a 10-minute show-and-tell session by the four-member Inspiration4 team as they flew at about 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 km per hour) over Europe. SpaceX, the private rocketship company owned by high-tech mogul and Tesla Inc To prepare for the re-entry and return, the spacecraft completed two rocket ""burns"" on Friday to reduce altitude and line up the capsule's trajectory with the landing site. The astronauts spent much of their first 48 hours aloft schmoozing from space, including phone calls with family, friends and supporters such as Musk and Hollywood star Tom Cruise, mission officials said. They also appeared by video linkup on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday for the ringing of the closing bell. Friday's orbital appearance aboard the Crew Dragon capsule was livestreamed over the YouTube channel of SpaceX, which supplied the spacecraft, launched it from Florida and operated it from the company's suburban Los Angeles headquarters. 'A CHAMP AT SPINNING' Billionaire Jared Isaacman, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc Sembroski was not alone in demonstrating spaceflight pastimes. Geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51, showed off a piece of her in-orbit artwork - a drawing rendered in metallic markers that she described as depicting the Crew Dragon capsule being carried away from Earth by an actual dragon. Hayley Arceneaux, 29, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children's Research Center in Tennessee, where she was once a childhood cancer patient herself, delighted in twirling about the cabin to give viewers a feel for microgravity. ""Hayley is a champ at spinning. She's been spinning from the moment we got in orbit,"" Proctor said. An attempt to show off spectacular views of Earth through the capsule's wide observation dome, or cupola, was more disappointing as the spacecraft flew into Earth's own shadow, though Proctor said she could see an aurora borealis display in the darkened sky below. It did not show up well on camera for viewers. Arceneaux also showed off a small plush-toy dog in a white coat, which the crew uses as its zero-gravity environment indicator. When it floats free in the cabin, they know they are in zero-G. The toy is loosely modeled after one of the golden retrievers serving as comfort dogs for young St. Jude patients. Replicas of the zero-G dog are being sold to raise money for St. Jude as part of the larger Inspiration4 charity mission conceived by Isaacman to benefit the cancer institute.

science,Chinese astronauts return after 90-day mission to space station," BEIJING, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Three Chinese astronauts returned to earth on Friday after a 90-day visit to an unfinished space station in the country's first crewed mission since 2016. In a small return capsule, the three men - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo - landed safely in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in the north of China at 1:34 p.m. (0534 GMT), state media reported. The Shenzhou-12 mission was the first of four crewed missions planned for 2021-2022 as China assembles its first permanent space station. The process requires 11 missions, including the launches of the station's three modules. Construction kicked off in April with the launch of the Tianhe module, the future living quarters of the space station. Slightly larger than a city bus, Tianhe was where Nie, Liu and Tang have stayed since mid-June, marking China's longest spaceflight mission. While in orbit, the astronauts conducted spacewalks, validated Tianhe's life-support system, tested the module's robotic arm, and sorted supplies for upcoming crewed missions. The second crewed mission is planned for October, with the next batch of astronauts expected to stay on Tianhe for six months. Ahead of that Shenzhou-13 mission, China will send an automated cargo spacecraft - Tianzhou-3 - to Tianhe carrying supplies needed by the next crew. Tianzhou-3 will be launched in the near future, state media said recently. Blocked by U.S. law from working with NASA and by extension on the U.S.-led International Space Station (ISS), China has spent the past decade developing technologies to construct its own space station.

science,"As workers age, robots take on more jobs -study"," Sept 16 (Reuters) - It turns out robots are taking over jobs fastest around the world in places where their human counterparts are aging the most rapidly. That is the conclusion of a new study that looked at demographic and industry-level data in 60 countries and found a powerful link between aging workforces - defined as the ratio of workers aged 56 and older, compared with those aged 21 to 55 - and robot use, focusing in particular on industrial settings. The research showed age alone accounted for 35% of the variation between countries in their adoption of robots, with those having older workers far more likely to adopt the machines. ?�Aging is a huge part of the story??in robot adoption, said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who conducted the study with Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. The research fits a longstanding trend of countries such as South Korea and Germany - which both have very rapidly aging workforces - also being among the world?�s fastest adopters of robots, based on the number of robots per human worker they deploy. ?�The U.S. has a huge technological advantage in a bunch of areas - including software and (artificial intelligence),??said Acemoglu. ?�But in robots, it's Germany, Japan and recently South Korea, that are further ahead.??Of the world?�s top 15 robotics companies, seven are based in Japan and seven in Germany, Acemoglu said. The researchers found a similar pattern inside the U.S. economy - with metropolitan areas that have older workforces also seeing great adoption of robots after 1990. The study examined 700 U.S. metros and used the number of robot ""integrators"" - firms that specialize in installing and maintaining industrial robots - as a proxy for local robotic activity. They found a 10 percentage-point increase in the aging of a local population led to a 6.45 percentage-point increase in the presence of these integrators.

Isaacman, who is rated to fly commercial and military jets, has assumed the role of mission ""commander,"" while Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate, has been designated as the ""pilot."" Rounding out the crew are ""chief medical officer"" Arceneaux, a bone cancer survivor turned St. Jude physician assistant, and mission ""specialist"" Sembroski, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer. The four crewmates have spent five months in rigorous preparations, including altitude fitness, centrifuge (G-force), microgravity and simulator training, emergency drills, classroom work and medical exams. Inspiration4 officials have said the mission is more than a joyride. While in orbit, the crew will perform a series of medical experiments with ""potential applications for human health on Earth and during future spaceflights,"" the group said. Biomedical data and biological samples, including ultrasound scans, will also be collected from crew members before, during and after the flight. Arceneaux was tasked with overseeing the medical experiments. She also made history as the youngest American launched into space and the youngest among just over 550 humans to reach Earth orbit, according to SpaceX.

science,Moroccan cave yields oldest clues about advent of human clothing," Sept 16 (Reuters) - People may take the necessity and existence of clothing for granted, from shirts to pants to dresses, coats, skirts, socks, underwear, bow ties, top hats, togas, kilts and bikinis. But it all had to start somewhere. Scientists on Thursday said artifacts unearthed in a cave in Morocco dating back as far as 120,000 years ago indicate that humans were making specialized bone tools, skinning animals and then using tools to process these skins for fur and leather. The items from Contrebandiers Cave, located roughly 800 feet (250 meters) from the Atlantic coastline in the town of Temara, appear to be the oldest-known evidence for clothing in the archaeological record, they added. Our species, Homo sapiens, first appeared more than 300,000 years ago in Africa, later spreading worldwide. The advent of clothing was a milestone for humankind, reflecting cultural and cognitive evolution. ""We assume that clothing was integral to the expansion of our species into cold habitats,"" said evolutionary archaeologist Emily Hallett of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, lead author of the study published in the journal iScience. The scientists found 62 tools made from animal bones and also identified a pattern of cut marks on the bones of three small carnivore species - a fox, jackal and wildcat - indicating they had been skinned for fur, not processed for meat. Antelope and wild cattle bones suggested that the skins of these animals may have been used to make leather, while the meat was eaten. ""Clothing is a unique human innovation,"" said evolutionary archaeologist and study co-author Eleanor Scerri, also of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. ""We use clothes in a practical sense, to stay warm, for example, or to protect our skin. We also use clothes symbolically, to express something about who we are, and they also meet a plethora of social conventions that articulate with our diverse global cultures,"" Scerri added. The cave artifacts date to a time period when evidence of personal adornment and other signs of human symbolic expression appear at various archaeological sites. Fur, leather and other organic clothing materials are highly perishable over time, and no actual prehistoric clothing was found at the cave. The tools were made during a period when the cave was occupied by members of our species from approximately 120,000 years ago to 90,000 years ago. The nature of the clothes they may have fashioned remains unclear. Of particular interest were tools with a broad rounded end, called spatulate tools. ""There are striations on the spatulate bone tools that are the result of use, and the sheen on the ends of the bone tools is the result of repeated use against skin. Bone tools with this shape are still used today to prepare pelts because they do not pierce the skin, they are durable and they are effective at removing connecting tissues without damage to the pelt,"" Hallett said. Until now some of the oldest evidence for Homo sapiens clothing was bone needles about 45,000-40,000 years old from Siberia. The researchers suspect that our species had begun making clothing thousands of years before the date of the Morocco artifacts, though archeological evidence is lacking. Genetic studies of clothing lice by other researchers suggest an origin for clothing by perhaps 170,000 years ago in Africa. It also is likely that Neanderthals, a close human cousin who entered Eurasia before Homo sapiens, made clothing, considering the cold regions they inhabited, the researchers said. They cited evidence for leather-working bone tools made by Neanderthals from roughly 50,000 years ago.

science,Floating like an astronaut for a day," SANTA MONICA, Calif., Sept 16 (Reuters) - As billionaire space enthusiasts blast off into space, the best most people can do is watch with envy. There is another way, however, to feel what it would be like to float in space like an astronaut at a mere $7,500 per person for a 90-minute trip. The Zero Gravity Experience allows adventurers to flip, float, somersault and hang upside-down in the hollowed-out cabin of a Boeing 727, said Zero G Corporation CEO Matt Gohd. When the modified G-Force One plane gets to an altitude of about 24,000 feet (7,300m), the pilots start to climb, and then push the plane over the top of a parabolic arc. That leaves passengers in free fall - they feel weightless for 20 to 30 seconds until the plane descends back to 24,000 feet. Pilots repeat the maneuver about 15 times during the flight. On Wednesday, a SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida carrying billionaire e-commerce executive Jared Isaacman and three other people he chose in the first all-tourist crew to orbit Earth. It marked the debut flight of SpaceX owner Elon Musk's new orbital tourism business. Isaacman paid an undisclosed sum to fellow billionaire Musk for the flight; Time magazine has put the ticket price for all four seats at $200 million. Rival companies Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc Zero G has been offering flights since 2004 and counts Virgin founder Richard Branson, Musk, astronaut Buzz Aldrin and physicist Stephen Hawking among its customers. This year, Gohd said there would be 65 to 70 flights. Amid the increased interest in space travel, Gohd expects that to rise to about 100 flights next year. ""When people go up on the flight ... everybody's giggling,"" said Gohd about the feeling of weightlessness. ""They've never felt anything like this. And they're like children again.""

science,Factbox: Profiles of first all-civilian space crew headed for orbit," Sept 15 (Reuters) - The quartet of private citizens who make up the Inspiration4 team, poised to make history aboard a SpaceX rocket ship as the first all-civilian crew launched into orbit, may appear at first glance to be everyday people, but they are far from ordinary. They consist of a billionaire internet commerce executive and jet pilot; a geoscientist and onetime finalist in NASA's astronaut candidate program; a physician's assistant at the childhood cancer hospital where she was once a patient; and an aerospace data engineer and U.S. Air Force veteran. The crew vehicle, dubbed Resilience, is Following are profiles of the Inspiration4 crew. JARED ISAACMAN, 38, MISSION COMMANDER Originator and billionaire benefactor of the Inspiration4 project, Isaacman paid an undisclosed hefty sum - reported by Time magazine to have run roughly $200 million - for all four seats aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. A lifelong aviation enthusiast who flew in the Black Diamond civilian aerobatics jet squad and co-founded a private air force of fighter planes for military training called Draken International, Isaacman earned his fortune in e-commerce. Isaacman parlayed the business he started as a teenager in the basement of his family's home into one of the leading U.S. financial transaction services, Shift4 Payments Inc SIAN PROCTOR, 51, MISSION PILOT A geoscience professor at South Mountain Community College in Phoenix with a doctorate in science education, Proctor's lifelong passion for space exploration is rooted in her father's work on Guam, where she was born, for a NASA tracking station during the Apollo lunar missions. A licensed pilot and major in Arizona's Civil Air Patrol, she has completed four ""analog"" astronaut projects involving simulated space activities, including a NASA-funded four-month artificial Mars mission to study food strategies for long-duration spaceflights. Proctor also was a 2009 finalist in NASA's astronaut candidate program, and is now poised to become only the fourth African-American woman ever to fly to space. She was chosen through an online business contest conducted by Shift4 Payments as part of the Inspiration4 crew selection. HAYLEY ARCENEAUX, 29, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER A childhood bone cancer survivor, Arceneaux went on to become a physician assistant at St. Jude Children's Research Center in Memphis, Tennessee, the leading pediatric cancer center where she was once a patient. Arceneaux, who lost part of her left thigh and knee to cancer at age 10, boasts that she will become the first person with a prosthetic body part to go into space. She will also be the youngest American to go to space and the youngest person ever to fly into orbit. According to SpaceX, only 553 humans have ever been to orbit. St. Jude, where Arceneaux now works with leukemia and lymphoma patients, is the chief beneficiary of the Inspiration4 project, which Isaacman conceived primarily as a fundraising and promotional endeavor for the institute. Arceneaux has said she was motivated to take part in the spaceflight to show her young patients ""what life can look like after cancer."" CHRIS SEMBROSKI, 42, MISSION SPECIALIST A data engineer at aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp Sembroski also conducted simulated space shuttle missions as a counselor for U.S. Space Camp, a government-funded science, technology and engineering youth camp in Huntsville, Alabama. He joined the U.S. Air Force as an electro-mechanical technician, and was deployed to Iraq and also helped maintain a fleet of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles before leaving active duty in 2007. Sembroski was selected for the Inspiration4 crew through a sweepstakes that drew 72,000 applicants and raised $113 million in St. Jude donations.

science,Russian space movie crew set for blast-off," MOSCOW, Sept 16 (Reuters) - A Russian crew of two cosmonauts and two cinema professionals is set to take off for the International Space Station (ISS) early next month to shoot the first movie in outer space, filmmakers said on Thursday. The four are scheduled to be launched on a Soyuz MS-19 craft on Oct. 5 to be delivered to the station, which orbits Earth at an altitude of around 220 miles (354 km). Their launch will come just weeks after that of the first all-civilian crew riding aboard a rocket and capsule developed by SpaceX, which adds an element of decades-long Russia-United States competition to the flight. ""This movie is built around a story of an ordinary person... a doctor who had nothing to do with space exploration and never thought about it is offered to travel to the ISS... and save a cosmonaut's life,"" director and actor Klim Shipenko told a news conference ahead of the crew's departure for the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The professional cosmonauts in the crew will also be seen in the movie. ""I won't be starring in it but still I will need to figure out how a movie is produced in such an unusual place as outer space,"" said commander Anton Shkaplerov. Lead actress Yulia Peresild said she has learned to be her own make-up artist and costume designer. ""It will not be on the same level as on Earth, but we will do our best. We are ready for it,"" she said. ""It is a bit too late to be afraid because we've come so far, there is Baikonur ahead and a lot of things (to do) and to be honest, there is just no time left for fear."" Director Shipenko, who is 1.9 metres (6 feet 2 inches) tall, said his height makes training inside the spacecraft - and the upcoming trip - not very comfortable. But accommodations will be made in the future, he said, adding: ""It is okay. I will fly now as it is, but when we do the sequel about travel to Mars, then they promise there will be a better seat.""

science,Scientists scramble to harvest ice cores as glaciers melt," Sept 13 (Reuters) - Scientists are Late last year, German-born chemist Margit Schwikowski and a team of international scientists attempted to gather ice cores from the Grand Combin glacier, high on the Swiss-Italian border, for a United Nations-backed climate monitoring effort. In 2018, they had scouted the site by helicopter and drilled a shallow test core. The core was in good shape, said Schwikowski: It had well-preserved atmospheric gases and chemical evidence of past climates, and ground-penetrating radar showed a deep glacier. Not all glaciers in the Alps preserve both summer and winter snowfall; if all went as planned, these cores would have been the oldest to date that did, she said. But in the two years it took for the scientists to return with a full drilling set-up, some of the information that had been trapped in the ice had vanished. Freeze-thaw cycles had created icy layers and meltwater pools throughout the glacier, what another team member described as a water-laden sponge, rendering the core useless for basic climate science. The sudden deterioration ?�tells us exactly how sensitive these glaciers are,"" said Schwikowski, head of the analytical chemistry group at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. ""We were just two years too late."" The mission on Grand Combin underscores the major challenge scientists face today in collecting ice cores: Some glaciers are disappearing faster than expected. The realization is prompting renewed urgency, causing those who specialize in harvesting ice cores to accelerate missions, rethink where to target next, and expand storage capacity. (Click Almost all of the world?�s glaciers are shrinking, according to the United Nations. In its most comprehensive climate report to date, published in August, the UN concluded that ?�human influence is very likely the main driver of the near-universal retreat of glaciers globally since the 1990s.??The report also said that without immediate, large-scale action, the average global temperature will reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial temperature average within 20 years. The pace at which glaciers are losing mass is also increasing. A study published in April in the science journal Nature found glaciers lost 227 gigatons of ice annually from 2000 to 2004, but that increased to an average of 298 gigatons a year after 2015. A gigaton is the equivalent of one billion metric tons. One gigaton of ice would fill New York City's Central Park and stand 341 meters (1,119 feet) high. About 10% of the land area on earth is currently covered with glacial ice, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. If a glacier is melting and no longer accumulating snow, it means it also isn?�t capturing atmospheric gases from today for scientists to study in the future. Two years ago, the south peak of Sweden?�s Kebnekaise mountain lost its designation as the country?�s highest point after a third of its summit glacier melted. For Schwikowski, the disappearance of glaciers isn?�t just a professional blow; it?�s an emotional hit, too. ""The mountains look different without them, barren,"" she said. In the Alps, the mountains without glaciers are ""absolutely frightening."" ?�COMPLETE SHOCK??Last September, Schwikowski stood bundled in snow gear as wet cylinders of ice were winched out of the boreholes on Grand Combin. The wetness surprised her, she said. Frigid meltwater drained from ice core pieces that should have been solid. And the core, which should have been translucent, had sections that were perfectly clear. Ice cores like those from Grand Combin have helped scientists illustrate humanity?�s impact on earth's climate by providing a record of greenhouse gases dating back well before industrialization. The ice preserves tiny air bubbles ??direct evidence of past atmospheres. Ice also captures air pollutants, pollen and other temperature and precipitation measures in a single archive, all on the same time scale, sometimes at the resolution of individual seasons. Another member of the Grand Combin expedition, Italian climate scientist Carlo Barbante, said the speed at which the ice on the Alpine massif had melted in the last few years was ?�much higher than it was before.??Finding the wet cores was a ""complete shock,"" he said. As a result, Barbante and other scientists - including Schwikowski - sped up plans to extract a core from the Colle Gnifetti glacier on the summit of the Alps??Monte Rosa, a few hundred meters higher than Grand Combin. In June, several months earlier than originally scheduled, they launched. The two cores they drilled were of good quality, Barbante said. Barbante said he is also hoping to organize a trip to Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa?�s highest mountain and the only possible ice core site left on the continent, next year or the year after. One study cited in the recent UN report calculated that present-day warming has already set in motion melting that will eliminate all glaciers on the mountain by 2060. A 2009 discovery by American scientist Douglas Hardy of the mummified remains of a 19th century pig on one of the highest points of the mountain?�s glaciers suggests some of the climate history the scientists are hoping to retrieve is already gone. ""The implication of that is that we've lost [the] last 200 years??worth of recorded time,"" said Hardy. Barbante and Schwikowski are part of a scientist-led group called Ice Memory that is trying to build an archive of ice cores from glaciers around the world. Ice Memory is endorsed by the UN?�s main cultural agency, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). So far they have drilled in Europe, Bolivia and Russia. The cores are temporarily being stored in Europe, but the plan is to ship them to Antarctica for long-term storage because the site wouldn?�t depend on power, which could suffer an outage. ""A hundred years from now, when the Alpine glaciers will be completely disappeared, we will have the samples"" for future generations of scientists, said Barbante. EXPANDING ICE STORAGE Beyond greenhouse gases, scientists say they may be able to use ice cores to study the DNA of ancient bacteria and viruses that could reemerge as the world warms. Frozen insects and plant pollen could also reveal histories of the world?�s forests and their fire cycles. Another team of scientists, whose findings were published in July in scientific journal Microbiome, found viruses nearly 15,000 years old in two ice core samples taken from the Tibetan Plateau in China. The findings identified genetic codes for 33 viruses, at least 28 of which were new to scientists. That team of scientists included U.S.-based ice core paleoclimatologists Lonnie Thompson and Ellen Mosley-Thompson, who are husband and wife. Lonnie Thompson said the speed at which ice is disappearing has driven plans to expand his ice core storage facilities at Ohio State University, which he began fundraising for last year. He hopes to raise $7 million. So far he has raised about $475,000 through donations and pledges, according to the school?�s Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center. The renovation will double the facility?�s storage capacity to more than 13,550 meters of ice cores. Some of the cores Thompson and his team have collected are the only remaining ice from some glaciers. Two of the six ice core sites on Kilimanjaro in Africa that his team drilled back in 2000 have disappeared. So have sites they drilled in 2010 in Papua, Indonesia. Others will likely be gone within 50 years, said Thompson. In some cases, lakes formed on the glaciers??surfaces as the ice melted, a red flag that indicated melting could be faster than models previously predicted. He said it was a wakeup call that cores needed to be harvested as soon as possible. ?�Ice has a wonderful archive of not only the climate, but also the forcings of climate,"" the major causes of climate change, Thompson said. ?�Those histories are at risk as the earth warms and the glaciers retreat.??Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."

science,EXCLUSIVE Lab-grown fish fingers anyone? Birds Eye owner explores cell-cultured seafood," LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Europe's largest frozen food group and the maker of Birds Eye fish fingers has teamed-up with U.S. company BlueNalu to develop seafood products grown from cells in a laboratory rather than harvested from the oceans. Nomad Foods, which also owns the Findus, Iglo, La Cocinera and Green Cuisine brands, told Reuters on Monday it aimed to commercialise cell-cultured seafood to help meet rising demand and to support efforts to safeguard the long-term sustainability of the planet's fish stocks. Through the tie-up, Nomad and BlueNalu will collaborate on market research and consumer insights, assess what is needed to gain the approval of regulators and explore new business and product opportunities for European markets. Europe is the largest importer of seafood in the world, with its citizens consuming more than three times as much as they produce, according to the European Union's Blue Economy Report. ""The importance of sustainability has never been more apparent, and the role of technology in delivering these needs is accelerating,"" said Nomad Foods Chief Executive Stéfan Descheemaeker. The process developed by San Diego, California-based BlueNalu sees living fish cells, isolated from the muscle, fat and connective tissue of a fish, fed the nutrition and care they need to multiply. They are then shaped into portions of seafood using practices commonly utilised in the food industry. There is no genetic modification. Nomad, which operates and manufactures in 14 markets across Europe, is the world?�s largest purchaser of sustainable wild caught fish. It said its agreement with BlueNalu represented the first of its kind in Europe between a consumer packaged goods company and a cell-cultured seafood company. BlueNalu is developing a variety of seafood products directly from fish cells. It focuses on fish species that are typically imported, difficult to farm-raise, are overfished or non-sustainable or typically contain higher levels of environmental contaminants. BlueNalu's tie-up with Nomad Foods follows already announced collaborations with Pulmuone Co Ltd. Rivals to BlueNalu include Bluu Biosciences, Finless Foods and Wild Type.

science,"All jokes aside, scientists find talking duck"," AMSTERDAM, Sept 10 (Reuters) - A Dutch scientist has uncovered old recordings of a musk duck mimicking the phrase, ""You bloody fool!"" - learnt when it was raised by humans in an Australian bird park. Leiden University scientist Carel Ten Cate said that what was interesting about the vocal expression of the waterfowl, nicknamed ""Ripper"", was not so much the message, but that he could imitate humans at all. ""It's definitely based on the human voice, even though the pronunciation is a bit odd - which might be the Australian accent, I don't know,"" said Ten Cate, who published his findings in the Netherlands' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society biological research journal. He said he had at first wondered whether the recordings, made in the 1980s, could be a hoax, but they were made by living ornithologist Peter Fullagar, who co-authored the paper. The recordings had been kept in a sound archive and referenced occasionally until Ten Cate rediscovered them in the course of his research on vocal learning in birds. Ten Cate said Ripper had a bit more in his repertoire - he could also make a noise like the sound of a door closing and its latch clicking. Some species of animals, and notably birds such as parrots and songbirds, are capable of mimicking human speech. But the phenomenon is rare - if somewhat more common in animals raised by humans. ""To find a species quite outside these groups...in a duck, that's quite extraordinary. So it's an independent evolutionary occurrence of the ability for vocal learning - that's very special,"" Ten Cate said.

science,Marine creature dubbed 'the mothership' was primordial scourge," Sept 8 (Reuters) - About 506 million years ago, a strange marine creature whose body so resembled a science-fiction spacecraft that it has been dubbed 'the mothership' thrived in tropical seas, menacing prey on the ocean floor in what is now Canada as one of Earth's largest predators to that point in time. Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of fossils of a Cambrian Period arthropod named Titanokorys gainesi in Kootenay National Park in the Canadian Rockies, within a vast rock formation called the Burgess Shale. The name Titanokorys means ""titanic helmet,"" and for good reason. This creature's head carapace represented about two-thirds of its body length of roughly 20 inches (50 cm). While that may not sound big by modern standards, during the Cambrian Period - a pivotal juncture in the history of life on Earth - it was a giant. ""Most other life forms were smaller than a human thumbnail at that time. By comparison, Titanokorys was longer than an adult human forearm. Yes, it was a giant dude,"" said paleontologist Jean-Bernard Caron of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, lead author of the study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Titanokorys boasted multifaceted eyes, a circular mouth studded with triangular tooth-like structures, two spiny rake-like claws to capture prey, feather-like gills and a series of flaps on the sides of its body for swimming. ""Overall, the animal looked torpedo-shaped and was relatively flat, an adaptation to living along the sea floor. It could be compared to a giant swimming head since the body was so short - very bizarre-looking beast indeed,"" Caron said. It lived at a time when most of north America was below tropical seas. ""When the carapace fossils were first discovered, they were so unusual looking that we weren't initially sure what sort of animal they belonged to,"" said paleontologist and study co-author Joe Moysiuk of the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum. ""In the field we nicknamed them 'the mothership,'"" Moysiuk added. The nickname 'spaceship' was given to a smaller cousin also found in the Burgess Shale, a treasure trove of Cambrian fossils. Scientists discovered partial fossils of at least a dozen Titanokorys individuals in British Columbia between 2014 and 2018. Arthropods are an expansive group including insects, spiders and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. They are invertebrates with exoskeletons, segmented bodies and jointed appendages. Its large head carapace makes Titanokorys resemble modern horseshoe crabs, though they represent different arthropod lineages. It was during the Cambrian Period, from about 542 million to 488 million years ago, when many major animal groups first burst onto the scene. The relatively short span of time in which this unfolded inspired the term 'Cambrian Explosion.' Titanokorys is a member of an arthropod lineage called radiodonts that lasted from about 520 million years ago to about 390 million years ago. Another radiodont was Anomalocaris, perhaps the largest Cambrian predator, reaching about 3 feet (1 meter) long. Spines on the grasping appendages of Anomalocaris were adapted to spear or grab sizable prey, differing from Titanokorys. Titanokorys apparently fed on buried prey like worms, using its claws to stir up the mud and strain out any morsels. Its claws were adapted not to grasp prey but to bring food toward its mouth. ""Titanokorys may have swum something like a modern stingray, undulating the flaps along the side of its body,"" Moysiuk said. It lived alongside various arthropods and worms as well as the small fish Metaspriggina, an evolutionary forerunner of the planet's many vertebrates, including people.

science,"South Korean researchers create chameleon-like artificial ""skin"""," SEOUL, Sept 9 (Reuters) - South Korean researchers say they have developed an artificial skin-like material, inspired by natural biology, that can quickly adjust its hues like a chameleon to match its surroundings. The team, led by Ko Seung-hwan, a mechanical engineering professor at Seoul National University, created the ""skin"" with a special ink that changes colour based on temperature and is controlled by tiny, flexible heaters. ""If you wear woodland camouflage uniforms in desert, you can be easily exposed,"" Ko told Reuters. ""Changing colours and patterns actively in accordance with surroundings is key to the camouflage technology that we created."" Ko and the team demonstrated the technology - thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) ink and vertically stacked multilayer silver nanowire heaters - using a robot with colour-detecting sensors. Whatever colours the sensors ""saw"" around it, the skin tried to mimic. In a video, the robot crawled over red, blue and green floors, instantly changing colour to match the background. ?�The colour information detected by sensors is transferred to a microprocessor and then to silver nanowire heaters. Once the heaters reach a certain temperature, the thermochromic liquid crystal layer changes its colour,??Ko said. The total thickness of the flexible, multi-layered artificial skin is less than a hundred micrometers - thinner than a human hair. By adding additional silver nanowire layers in simple shapes such as dots, lines or squares, the skin can create complex patterns. ?�The flexible skin can be developed as a wearable device and used for fashion, military camouflage uniforms, exterior of cars and buildings for aesthetic purposes, and for future display technology,??Ko said. The research was published in the journal Nature Communications in August.

science,"U.S. university, energy firm hail test of energy fusion project"," MILAN, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Commonwealth Fusion Systems successfully tested the world's most powerful high-temperature superconducting magnet in a step toward building a fusion power plant to generate carbon-free power. Italian energy group Eni CFS, MIT and Eni announced the test results on Wednesday. The test showed that the superconducting magnet built by MIT and CFS could generate a sustained magnetic field powerful enough for a CFS device to achieve net energy from fusion, which CFS said was a historic first. CFS aims to use the technology to build a commercially viable fusion power plant to generate zero-emission electricity. ""For Eni, magnetic confinement fusion holds a pivotal role in the technological research for decarbonization, as it will (allow) humanity to access large quantities of energy produced,??Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said. As governments round the world pick up efforts to combat climate change, energy companies like Eni have launched transition strategies to cut carbon footprints. CFS works on a fusion device known as a tokamak. Achieving net energy from fusion with tokamaks has previously relied on device scale, but high temperature superconductors will enable CFS to reach net energy from fusion with a smaller and cheaper tokamak and on a faster timeline, CFS said. CFS plans to have a first experimental device with net energy production by 2025 and a first plant to start feeding energy into the grid in the 2030s, Eni said.

science,SpaceX prepares to send first all-civilian crew into orbit," Sept 12 (Reuters) - Yet another billionaire entrepreneur is set to ride into space this week, strapped inside the capsule of a SpaceX rocketship as part of an astro-tourist team poised to make history as the first all-civilian crew launched into Earth orbit. Jared Isaacman, the American founder and chief executive of e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments The 38-year-old tech mogul has plunked down an unspecified but presumably exorbitant sum for fellow billionaire and SpaceX owner Elon Musk to fly Isaacman and three specially selected travel mates into orbit aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The crew vehicle, dubbed Resilience, was set for liftoff from NASA's Kennedy Space Center atop one of Musk's reusable Falcon 9 rockets, with a five-hour targeted launch window that opens at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. Forecasts on Sunday predicted a 70% chance of favorable weather conditions for launch, organizers said, on a flight directed entirely from the ground. A successful flight could spawn a new era of commercial space tourism, with several firms vying for wealthy customers to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of supersonic travel, weightlessness and the visual spectacle of space. Setting acceptable levels of consumer risk in the inherently dangerous endeavor of rocket travel is also key, and raises a  pointed question. ""Do you have to be both rich and brave to get on these flights right now?"" Sridhar Tayur, a professor of operations management and new business models at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, asked in an interview with Reuters on Friday. The so-called Inspiration4 mission was conceived by Isaacman mainly to raise awareness and support for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center. He has pledged $100 million personally to the institute. BEYOND THE BILLIONAIRE SPACE RACE SpaceX is easily the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. Rival companies Virgin Galactic But those two high-profile flights were suborbital in scale, sending their crews of citizen astronauts to space and back in a matter of minutes. The SpaceX flight is designed to carry its four passengers where no all-civilian crew has gone before, into Earth orbit. There, they will circle the globe once every 90 minutes at more than 17,000 mph (27,360 kph), or roughly 22 times the speed of sound. The target altitude is 575 kilometers, or nearly 360 miles, beyond the orbits of the International Space Station or even the Hubble Space Telescope. Like Blue Origin, the 20-story-tall SpaceX launch vehicle and crew capsule will take off vertically from a launch pad on a flight directed entirely from the ground. Branson's suborbital rocket plane, by contrast, had two highly trained pilots at the controls as it carried its four rear-seat passengers 50 miles (81 km) high. The Inspiration4 crew will have no part to play in operating their spacecraft, despite some largely honorary titles, though two, Isaacman and geoscientist Sian Proctor, are licensed pilots. Isaacman, who is rated to fly commercial and military jets, has assumed the role of mission ""commander,"" while Proctor, 51, once a NASA astronaut candidate herself, has been designated as the mission ""pilot."" She was selected to join the team through an online contest run by Shift4 Payments. Rounding out the crew are ""chief medical officer"" Hayley Arceneaux, 29, a bone cancer survivor turned St. Jude physicians' assistant, and mission ""specialist"" Chris Sembroski, 42, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer. Sembroski won a seat in a sweepstake that drew 72,000 applicants and has raised more than $100 million in St. Jude donations. The four crewmates have spent five months making rigorous preparations, including altitude fitness, centrifuge (G-force), microgravity and simulator training, emergency drills, classroom work and medical exams. SpaceX and the crew planned a full dress-rehearsal of launch-day activities at the Cape on Sunday night, to be followed by a final ""static"" test firing of the rocket's engines, organizers said. Inspiration4 officials stress that the mission is more than a joyride. Once in orbit, the crew will perform medical experiments with ""potential applications for human health on Earth and during future spaceflights,"" the group said in media materials.

science,Sobi arthritis drug cuts death risk; heart drugs may help prevent COVID-19 blood clots," Sept 10 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. Arthritis drug cuts death risk in high-risk patients Hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for becoming critically ill and dying had significantly better outcomes if they received the anti-inflammatory drug anakinra, researchers have found. To test the drug, sold as Kineret by Sweden's Sobi Inc Heart drugs might help prevent COVID-19 blood clots Drugs that prevent blood clots after procedures to unclog heart arteries might also be useful for clot prevention in patients with COVID-19, new data suggests. The coronavirus is known to affect genes that control platelets, fragments in the blood that form clots. The inflammatory proteins generated by the virus cause platelets to become ""hyperreactive"" and form clots more easily and more often. In test tube experiments described on Wednesday in Mu variant's escape from antibodies may inform vaccine research The ability of the Mu variant of the coronavirus to escape from antibodies and vaccines can aid in preparations against other emerging variants, Japanese researchers say. The variant  has driven outbreaks in Colombia and is now classified as a ""variant of interest"" by the World Health Organization, although it appears unlikely to overtake the far more prevalent Delta variant. In test tube experiments, researchers found that Mu is ""highly resistant"" to antibodies in blood samples from COVID-19 survivors and from people who got the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer U.S. data underestimated COVID-19 nursing home deaths    U.S. government data underestimated COVID-19 cases and nursing home deaths at the beginning of the pandemic, a new study suggests. A comparison of federal numbers to those tallied by individual states, published on Thursday in JAMA Network Open, finds that the U.S. government missed 43.7% of COVID-19 cases and 40% of deaths in nursing homes early in the health crisis because these figures were not tracked until May 24, 2020. ""Because of the delay in federal reporting, roughly 68,000 cases and 16,000 deaths in nursing homes were missed,"" said coauthor Karen Shen of Harvard University. Those represent 11.6% of COVID-19 cases and 14.0% of COVID-19 deaths in nursing home residents in 2020, the study estimated. ""The catastrophe of being a resident in a long-term care facility with multiple impairments was almost a death sentence"" early in the pandemic, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health who was not involved in the research.

science,NASA rover Perseverance collects first Martian rock sample," LOS ANGELES, Sept 7 (Reuters) - NASA's Mars science rover Perseverance has collected and stashed away the first of numerous mineral samples that the U.S. space agency hopes to retrieve from the surface of the Red Planet for analysis on Earth. Tools attached to Perseverance and operated by mission specialists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles drilled a rock core slightly thicker than a pencil from an ancient Martian lake bed, then hermetically sealed it in a titanium specimen tube inside the rover. The feat, accomplished on Sept. 1 and publicly confirmed by NASA late on Monday, marked the first such mineral sample obtained from the surface of another planet, according to the space agency. NASA chief and former astronaut Bill Nelson hailed it as ""a momentous achievement."" The space agency plans to collect as many as 43 mineral samples over the next few months from the floor of Jerezo Crater, a wide basin where scientists think water flowed and microbial life may have flourished billions of years ago. The six-wheeled, SUV-sized vehicle is also expected to explore walls of sediment deposited at the foot of a remnant river delta once etched into a corner of the crater and considered a prime spot for study. Mineral collection is the heart of the $2.7 billion Perseverance project. Two future missions to Mars, to be jointly conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency, are planned to retrieve those specimens in the next decade and return them to Earth, where astrobiologists will examine them for signs of tiny fossilized organisms. Such fossils would represent the first conclusive proof that life has ever existed beyond Earth. Perseverance, the fifth and by far most sophisticated rover NASA has sent to Mars since its first, Sojourner, arrived in 1997, landed in Jerezo Crater in February after a 293 million-mile flight from Earth. Success of the first sample collection, taken from a flat, briefcase-sized rock using the rotary-percussive drill at the end of Perseverance's robotic arm, was verified through imagery taken by the rover's cameras as the sample was measured, cataloged and stored, NASA said. The rover's sampling and caching system, consisting of more than 3,000 parts, was described by JPL's interim director, Larry James, as ""the most complex mechanism ever sent into space.""

science,"Explainer: Beyond Delta, scientists are watching new coronavirus variants"," CHICAGO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spawned a Greek alphabet of variants - a naming system used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to track concerning new mutations of the virus that causes Scientists remain focused on Delta, now the dominant variant around the world, but are DELTA - STILL DOMINANT The Delta variant first detected in India remains the most worrisome. It is striking unvaccinated populations in many countries and has proven capable of infecting a higher proportion of vaccinated people than its predecessors. The WHO classifies Delta as a variant of concern, meaning it has been shown capable of increasing transmissibility, causing more severe disease or reducing the benefit of vaccines and treatments. According to Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, Delta's ""superpower"" is its transmissibility. Chinese researchers found that people infected with Delta carry 1,260 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version of the coronavirus. Some U.S. research suggests that the viral load in vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta is on par with those who are unvaccinated, but more research is needed. While the original coronavirus took up to seven days to cause symptoms, Delta can cause symptoms two to three days faster, giving the immune system less time to respond and mount a defense. LAMBDA ??ON THE WANE The Lambda variant had attracted attention as a potential new threat, but this version of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru in December, appears to be receding. Although cases involving Lambda were rising in July, reports of this variant have been falling globally for the past four weeks, according to data by GISAID, a database that tracks SARS-CoV-2 variants. The WHO classifies Lambda as a variant of interest, meaning it carries mutations suspected of causing a change in transmissibility or causing more severe disease, but it is still under investigation. Lab studies show it has mutations that resist vaccine-induced antibodies. MU - ONE TO WATCH Mu, the variant formerly known as B.1.621, was first identified in Colombia in January. On Aug. 30, the WHO designated it as a variant of interest due to several concerning mutations, and assigned a Greek letter name to it. Mu carries key mutations, including E484K, N501Y and D614G, that have been linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immune protection. According to the WHO's Bulletin published last week, Mu has caused some larger outbreaks in South America and Europe. While the number of genetic sequences identified as Mu have fallen below 0.1% globally, Mu represents 39% of variants sequenced in Colombia and 13% in Ecuador, places where its prevalence has ""consistently increased,"" WHO reported. The global health agency said it continues to monitor Mu for changes in South America, especially in areas where it is co-circulating with the Delta variant. Maria van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said circulation of the variant is decreasing globally but needs to be observed closely. In a press briefing last week, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said U.S. officials are watching it, but so far Mu is not considered an immediate threat. MORE ON THE WAY? Getting more people vaccinated against COVID-19 is critical as large groups of unvaccinated people give the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate into new variants. That effort must be stepped up internationally to keep variants from emerging unchecked among the populations of poor nations where very few people have been inoculated, experts say. Even so, while the current vaccines prevent severe disease and death, they do not block infection. The virus is still capable of replicating in the nose, even among vaccinated people, who can then transmit the disease through tiny, aerosolized droplets. To defeat SARS-CoV-2 will likely require a new generation of vaccines that also block transmission, according to Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine developer at the Mayo Clinic. Until then, Poland and other experts say, the world remains vulnerable to the rise of new coronavirus variants. Our Standards: Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that Moderna Inc had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong."

science,China develops prototype miniature helicopter for Mars missions," BEIJING, Sept 2 (Reuters) - China has developed a prototype miniature helicopter for surveillance work on future Mars missions, according to its space science agency, following the historic landing of a robotic rover on the Red Planet a few months ago. The prototype is similar in appearance to the robotic helicopter Ingenuity, developed by NASA for its Perseverance mission this year, according to a photograph posted on the website of China's National Space Science Center on Wednesday. The agency said the helicopter could be a tool for China's follow-up exploration on Mars, but it did not give details. China landed a Mars rover in May in its first-ever mission to the planet, becoming the second country after the United States to do so. NASA's most advanced rover, Perseverance, landed on the planet in February. From the NASA rover, Ingenuity made its inaugural flight in April, rising about 3 metres (10 feet) above the surface, in humankind's first successful deployment of a powered aircraft in a world other than Earth. The challenge for the 1.8 kg (4 pound) Ingenuity is the planet's thin atmosphere, which is just 1% as dense as Earth's. To compensate for the lack of aerodynamic lift, NASA engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger - 1.2 metres (4 feet) tip to tip - and spin more rapidly than would be needed on Earth for an aircraft of its size. Like Ingenuity, the Chinese prototype sports two rotor blades, a sensor-and-camera base and four thin legs. But there is no solar panel at the top like Ingenuity, according to the photograph. Ingenuity has made more than 10 outings since April, covering an overall distance of more than 2 km (1.2 miles) with flight time of about 20 minutes in all.

science,Don't look now: How a robot's gaze can affect the human brain," Sept 1 (Reuters) - It has long been known that making eye contact with a robot can be an unsettling experience. Scientists even have a name for the queasy feeling: the ""uncanny valley"". Now, thanks to researchers in Italy, we also know it's more than just a feeling. A team at the Istituto Italiano Di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa have shown how a robot's gaze can trick us into thinking we are socially interacting and slow our ability to make decisions. ""Gaze is an extremely important social signal that we employ on a day-to-day basis when interacting with others,"" said Professor Agnieszka Wykowska, lead author of the research, published on Wednesday in the journal Science Robots. ""The question is whether the robot gaze will evoke very similar mechanisms in the human brain as another human's gaze would."" The team asked 40 volunteers to play a video game of ""chicken"" - where each player has to decide whether to allow a car to drive straight towards another car or to deviate to avoid a collision - against a humanoid robot sitting opposite them. Between rounds players had to look at the robot, which would sometimes look back and other times look away. In each scenario, the scientists collected data on behaviour and neural activity via electroencephalography (EEG), which detects electrical activity in the brain. ""Our results show that, actually, the human brain processes the robot gaze as a social signal, and that signal has an impact on the way we're making decisions, on the strategies we deploy in the game and also on our responses,"" Wykowska said. ""The mutual gaze of the robot affected decisions by delaying them, so humans were much slower in making the decisions in the game."" The findings have implications on where and how humanoid robots are deployed in future. ""Once we understand when robots elicit social attunement, then we can decide it which sort of context this is desirable and beneficial for humans and in which context this should not occur,"" said Wykowska. According to a report by the International Federation of Robotics, worldwide sales of professional service robots had already jumped 32% to $11.2 billion between 2018 and 2019.

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review. 'Long COVID' tied to higher kidney risks COVID-19 symptoms that persist long after infection, known as ""long COVID"", has been tied to a higher risk for new kidney problems, according to a new study. Analyzing data on more than 1.7 million U.S. veterans, including nearly 90,000 COVID-19 survivors with symptoms lasting at least 30 days, researchers found the ""long haulers"" were at higher risk for new kidney problems compared to people who had not been infected with the coronavirus. This was true even when survivors had not been hospitalized, although declines in kidney function were ""more profound"" with more severe infection, they reported on Wednesday in the Loss of smell may be followed by smell distortions Many people who lose their sense of smell due to COVID-19 eventually regain it, but some survivors later report smell distortions and unexplained smells, a new study found.

science,Launching into space? Not so fast. Insurers balk at new coverage," Sept 1 (Reuters) - An ever-swelling amount of space debris is threatening satellites that hover around Earth, making insurers leery of offering coverage to the devices that transmit texts, maps, videos and scientific data, industry sources said. Thousands of new satellites are being launched into areas where orbital rubbish has been accumulating since early space missions nearly 65 years ago. The surging collision risks have left the handful of insurers that offer satellite coverage pulling back or exiting the market, executives and analysts said. ""This is a real issue for insurance,"" said Richard Parker, co-founder of Assure Space, a unit of AmTrust Financial. Over a year ago, the company stopped providing spacecraft insurance in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where most satellites operate. The few policies it has sold since then exclude collision damage. ""It may start to get difficult to get that type of coverage in the near future as more insurers realize that this is a significant risk that we can't even get our arms around,"" Parker told Reuters. There are 8,055 satellites roaming Earth's orbits, 42% of them inactive, according to Seradata, which tracks the statistics. Most operate in the LEO, which extends 2,000 kilometers, or 1,243 miles, beyond Earth. The number of active satellites has jumped 68% from a year ago and more than 200% from five years ago. Much of the new activity has come from billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX, as it expands its Starlink broadband network. SpaceX did not reply to requests for comment. As a privately held company, it does not disclose whether its satellites are insured. Other major companies including Google, Apple and Amazon also rely on satellites to transmit data, as do telecom providers, government agencies and universities working on space research, insurance sources said. Space coverage has been a lucrative niche for insurers, which took in $475 million in gross premiums to cover satellites, rockets and unmanned space flights last year and paid just $425 million in losses, according to Seradata. Space premiums are 10-20 times aviation premiums, said Peter Elson, CEO of insurance broker Gallagher Aerospace. ""This is a risky business in the first place,??he said. MESS IN SPACE The insurance dilemma underlines a greater problem: no one is cleaning up the mess in space. Government agencies track thousands of pieces of debris, including inside a ""graveyard orbit"" where old geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites are sent to die with their last bits of fuel, 36,000 kilometers, or 22,370 miles into space. LEO satellites are much smaller than GEO satellites. Typically the size of a small refrigerator, they need $500,000 to $1 million worth of coverage, far below the $200 million to $300 million for those in the GEO, industry experts said. Historically, policies have protected devices against loss, failure or damage from launch through their orbiting life, but not revenue losses from outages. Operators could add liability coverage in case one satellite damages another or re-enters the atmosphere in a way that causes damage or injury on the ground. About half of new satellite launches now have insurance, said Denis Bousquet, an executive in AXA XL?�s space business. Industry sources expect more policies to exclude collision coverage and fewer satellites to have insurance at all. ""The concentrations of debris and increasing numbers of satellites being deployed are increasing the potential for collision,"" said Charles Wetton, underwriting manager for space policies at insurer Global Aerospace. DEBRIS GRAVEYARD Only 11 spacecraft have suffered a partial or total failure due to suspected debris strikes over the past decade, according to Seradata, making insurer worries largely theoretical for now. Yet because insurers predict risks over the life of current and future policies, space underwriters fret over doomsday scenarios years ahead. Wetton cited the possibility of a ""Kessler effect,"" named for NASA space debris expert Don Kessler who developed the theory in 1978. It anticipates LEO becoming so crowded that there is a cascade of collisions. There are no signs such a situation is imminent, but it would render entire orbits uninsurable, Wetton said. Assure Space's Parker said he is confident a major collision will occur within the next three years, rendering insurance nearly impossible to obtain. New insurers may enter the market to alleviate supply-demand strains. Until then, industry experts said companies, universities and government agencies will likely bear more financial responsibility.

science,"Below a pyramid, a treasure trove sheds new light on ancient Mexican rites"," TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico, Sept 1 (Reuters) - More than a decade after Sergio Gomez began excavating a tunnel under a towering Mexican pyramid, the archeologist still spends most of his time studying the massive cache of sacred artifacts carefully placed there by priests some 2,000 years ago. The volume and variety of objects hidden in the sealed tunnel under Teotihuacan's ornate Feathered Serpent Pyramid has shattered records for discoveries at the ancient city, once the most populous metropolis of the Americas and now a top tourist draw just outside modern-day Mexico City. Over 100,000 artifacts from the tunnel have been cataloged so far, ranging from finely-carved statues, jewelry, shells, and ceramics as well as thousands of wooden and metallic objects that mostly survived the passage of time intact. On a recent tour of the tunnel and conservation workshops where his 30-member team pores over the trove, Gomez showed off some of the dig's most spectacular and until now unreported finds - all part of ceremonial offerings left along the 100-meter-long (330 ft) tunnel, which ended in three chambers directly under the pyramid's mid-point. ""Can you see it?"" Gomez asked, shining the light of his cellphone on a tennis-ball-sized carved amber sphere he picked up from a workshop table. Illuminated, it looks like molten lava. It is the first time an ornament made from amber has turned up in Teotihuacan. Found with a small top and residue inside that awaits further analysis - Gomez speculates it may be tobacco - it likely hung around a priest's neck. As in other ancient Mexican societies, the priests who entered the tunnel likely ingested hallucinogenic plants or mushrooms as part of rituals, Gomez said. The tunnel, which is tall enough in most places to walk through and is around 12 meters (40 ft) underground, was designed to dazzle, he explained. The walls and even the floor were coated with fine bits of iron pyrite, popularly known as fool's gold due to its resemblance to the precious metal. ""We can imagine when the priests entered with a torch how it would have sparkled as the flame moved,"" said Gomez, who believes the tunnel was made to recreate the underworld of their cosmovision and used to initiate new rulers. Scientific dating shows that the damp, never-looted space was in use for more than two centuries through 250 A.D. Teotihuacan, a wealthy contemporary of ancient Rome and Han China, thrived from about 100 B.C. to 550 A.D. and was home to up to 200,000 people mostly living in multi-family stone compounds painted with colorful murals. Much is unknown about them, including what language they spoke and whether they developed a system of FINAL DISCOVERY Walking through the now-empty tunnel, Gomez stops where a large offering was found. He describes 17 separate layers of shells meticulously laid down by priests, one on top of the other, with the bottom layers crushed. ""But that's because they themselves were stepping on them,"" he said. Gomez stresses that his dozen-year excavation of the tunnel, which had filled with mud over the centuries, was equally meticulous, so much so that bits of human hair and even skin were likely recovered. It appears that ceremonies in the tunnel involved the offering of gifts to the lords of the underworld, and to the city's main deity, the storm god. Several dozen nearly-identical shiny black jars sculpted to resemble the latter have been discovered. Among the richest offerings are hundreds of objects made of so-called imperial jade, one of the world's most expensive gems, including ear spools, necklaces and pendants - one in the form of a crocodile. Several thousand once-glittering iron pyrite pieces were unearthed. Possibly imported from as far away as Honduras, they include beads, disks and even the bottom half of a cup. Around 8,000 wooden objects - plates, bowls and more - were unearthed, as well as the skulls and claws of some three dozen animal species, especially predators like jaguars and pumas. Beyond traditional restoration work, Gomez's team is also developing three-dimensional digital recreations of the artifacts as they originally would have appeared, so they can eventually be accessed online. The final physical discovery made in late July proved especially satisfying for Gomez. In a circular pit carved into the tunnel floor previously missed by laser scans, priests had tossed four bunches of flowers. On top, they placed a heap of wood, handfuls of corn, chile, and nopal seeds, plus a miniature stone carved pyramid. Finally, they set it all on fire. Thanks to the charred wood, Gomez will soon be able to pinpoint the year the smoky ritual took place. The flowers were unprecedented, the first time intact plant remains have been found at Teotihuacan. ""It's just so unique,"" he said, hunching down just off the pit, wiping his brow. ""It makes you feel so close to the people who were here.""

science,"Brazilian viper venom may become tool in fight against COVID,  study shows"," SAO PAULO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian researchers have found that a molecule in the venom of a type of snake inhibited coronavirus reproduction in monkey cells, a possible first step toward a drug to combat the virus causing COVID-19. A study published in the scientific journal Molecules this month found that the molecule produced by the jararacussu pit viper inhibited the virus's ability to multiply in monkey cells by 75%. ""We were able to show this component of snake venom was able to inhibit a very important protein from the virus,"" said Rafael Guido, a University of Sao Paulo professor and an author of the study. The molecule is a peptide, or chain of amino acids, that can connect to an enzyme of the coronavirus called PLPro, which is vital to reproduction of the virus, without hurting other cells. Already known for its antibacterial qualities, the peptide can be synthesized in the laboratory, Guido said in an interview, making the capture or raising of the snakes unnecessary. ""We're wary about people going out to hunt the jararacussu around Brazil, thinking they're going to save the world ... That's not it!"" said Giuseppe Puorto, a herpetologist running the Butantan Institute's biological collection in Sao Paulo. ""It's not the venom itself that will cure the coronavirus."" Researchers will next evaluate the efficiency of different doses of the molecule and whether it is able to prevent the virus from entering cells in the first place, according to a statement from the State University of Sao Paulo (Unesp), which was also involved in the research. They hope to test the substance in human cells but gave no timeline. The jararacussu is one of the largest snakes in Brazil, measuring up to 6 feet (2 meters) long. It lives in the coastal Atlantic Forest and is also found in Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina.

science,Russian cosmonauts find new cracks in ISS module," MOSCOW, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Russian cosmonauts have discovered new cracks in a segment of the International Space Station that could widen, a senior space official said on Monday, the latest in a series of setbacks. ""Superficial fissures have been found in some places on the Zarya module,"" Vladimir Solovyov, chief engineer of rocket and space corporation Energia, told RIA news agency. ""This is bad and suggests that the fissures will begin to spread over time."" He did not say if the cracks had caused any air to leak. The space official has said previously that much of the International Space Station's equipment is starting to age and has warned there could be an ""avalanche"" of broken equipment after 2025. The space station has suffered several recent incidents. Russian officials last month said a software glitch, and a possible lapse in human attention, were to blame for throwing the ISS out of control. Jet thrusters on the Russian research module Nauka inadvertently reignited a few hours after it had docked, causing the entire orbital outpost to pitch out of its normal flight position with seven crew members aboard. Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, also reported last month a drop in pressure in the Zvezda service module, which provides living quarters for crew members on the ISS that was caused by an air leak. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, has said it will remain part of the ISS until 2024 and that it is open to extending its participation beyond then.

science,Mystery of space inspired New Zealand rocket man's journey to Nasdaq," WELLINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - New Zealand entrepreneur Peter Beck said his space firm Rocket Lab The small satellite launch firm, often compared to Tesla Inc Rocket Lab agreed in March to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm backed by private equity firm Vector Capital, the latest in a series of space firm listings involving special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC). ""For me personally, the biggest question that I can possibly answer in my lifetime, and the biggest question for everybody on earth really comes down to are we the only life in the universe or not,"" Beck told Reuters from New Zealand after the listing. Growing up in Invercargill, a city near the southern tip of New Zealand?�s South Island, he first got interested in space when his father pointed to the stars and said there could be someone watching him from there. ""That was the most mind-blowing moment in my young life. So I promised myself that if I ever had the chance to answer the question, which is fundamentally important to the way we think, I would have a crack. I am pleased to have this opportunity. We have spacecraft, launch pads and the team to do it."" Rocket Lab was selected this year to develop a spacecraft for a NASA mission to Mars. The company is also leading a private mission to Venus in 2023, working with a leading science team that discovered a gas called Phosphine in the clouds of Venus last year. ""It's a life-finding mission, it's a high risk mission and the very first private mission to another planet,"" said Beck. Rocket Lab, whose backers have included defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp The company?�s Electron launch vehicle has become the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket annually and has delivered 105 satellites to orbit for private and public sector organisations. Beck said that while there are many competitors with more funding and time, Musk's Space X and Rocket Lab are the only ones delivering regular commercial space missions. Rocket Lab is also eyeing more acquisitions to help build scale for its space transport and space systems business. In April last year, it acquired Canadian company Sinclair Interplanetary. After an initial bump to $11.60 at its Nasdaq debut, the firm's shares dropped nearly 10%, settling at $10.43. New shares were issued at US$10.00 each. But Beck dismissed the debut share price drop: ""We are in this for the long haul.""

science,Thailand develops robotic system to squeeze out more vaccine doses," BANGKOK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - As Thailand struggles with its worst coronavirus outbreak yet, researchers in the country have developed a machine to draw out COVID-19 vaccine doses more efficiently and optimise lower-than-expected supplies. Using a robotic arm, the ""AutoVacc"" system can draw 12 doses of the AstraZeneca That is up 20% from the standard 10 doses drawn manually, they said. The machine only works on AstraZeneca multi-dose vials currently and labels show each vial can provide 10 to 11 doses. ""The machine guarantees with accuracy that we can gain an extra 20% from each vaccine vial - from 10 to 12 doses,"" said Juthamas Ratanavaraporn, the lead researcher of the team at the university's Biomedical Engineering Research Center.""The extra 20% that we get means that if we have AstraZeneca for 1 million people, this machine can increase the number of doses to 1.2 million people,"" said Juthamas. While some health workers using low dead space syringes (LDSS) that aim to reduce wastage can draw up to 12 doses per vial, it requires manpower and a high level of skill, she said. ""This could drain a lot of the health workers' energy. They would have to do this every day for many months,"" Juthamas said. Thailand had kept COVID-19 largely under control for much of the pandemic, but more virulent variants like Delta have sent cases and deaths soaring since April, ramping up pressure on authorities to increase the pace of vaccinations. So far, around 9% of Thailand's population of more than 66 million The research team say they should be able to produce 20 more AutoVacc units within three or four months, but that government funds and support would be needed to expand across the country. The prototype machine costs 2.5 million baht ($76,243), including other materials like syringes, said Juthamas, adding that while they were open to export opportunities, that was something for the future. They also plan to make similar machines to use with the Pfizer-BioNTech Juthamas said the machine was aimed at removing burdens on health workers. Thailand has reported around 1.1 million COVID-19 infections and 10,085 deaths in total, pushing parts of the health system ""When the health workers are too tired, there are also chances of human error, so we should let the machines work on this,"" she said.

science,Fossil of previously unknown four-legged whale found in Egypt," CAIRO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Scientists said on Wednesday they had discovered the 43 million-year-old fossil of a previously unknown amphibious four-legged whale species in Egypt that helps trace the transition of whales from land to sea. The newly discovered whale belongs to the Protocetidae, a group of extinct whales that falls in the middle of that transition, the Egyptian-led team of researchers said in a statement. Its fossil was unearthed from middle Eocene rocks in the Fayum Depression in Egypt's Western Desert -- an area once covered by sea that has provided a rich seam of discoveries showing the evolution of whales -- before being studied at Mansoura University Vertebrate Palaeontology Centre (MUVP). The new whale, named Phiomicetus anubis, had an estimated body length of some three meters (10 feet) and a body mass of about 600 kg (1,300 lb), and was likely a top predator, the researchers said. Its partial skeleton revealed it as the most primitive protocetid whale known from Africa. ""Phiomicetus anubis is a key new whale species, and a critical discovery for Egyptian and African paleontology,"" said Abdullah Gohar of MUVP, lead author of a paper on the discovery published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The whale's  genus name honours the Fayum Depression and species name refers to Anubis, the ancient canine-headed Egyptian god associated with mummification and the afterlife. Despite recent fossil discoveries, the big picture of early whale evolution in Africa has largely remained a mystery, the researchers said. Work in the region had the potential to reveal new details about the evolutionary transition from amphibious to fully aquatic whales. With rocks covering about 12 million years, discoveries in the Fayum Depression ""range from semiaquatic crocodile-like whales to giant fully aquatic whales"", said Mohamed Sameh of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, a co-author. The new whale has raised questions about ancient ecosystems and pointed research towards questions such as the origin and coexistence of ancient whales in Egypt, said Hesham Sellam, founder of the MUVP and another co-author.

science,Mexico City taps solar energy to clean up historic Aztec-era canals," MEXICO CITY, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Mexican scientists have developed a unique ""nanobubble"" system using solar energy to improve water quality in the canals of Mexico City's Xochimilco ecological zone, a popular tourist attraction. Officials in Mexico City have been focused on cleaning up the long-polluted waters of Xochimilco, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the few areas of the capital that still boasts canal networks dating back to Aztec times. A team of researchers from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) has developed a method using solar energy to activate a pump that sends cleansing ""nanobubbles"" into the water. The bubbles help oxygenate the water, eliminating harmful pollutants and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which leads to healthier flora and fauna, according to Refugio Rodriguez Vazquez, a Cinvestav researcher. ""We've seen in the places that we have bubbled a good proliferation of the Montezuma frog,"" Rodriguez said, referring to one of Mexico's native amphibian species. Xochimilco is known for ""chinampas,"" floating beds of farm produce cultivated by the Aztecs in the 14th century to feed the population of the pre-Hispanic city. The nanobubble system enables local farmers ""to be able to work on their chinampas and make them productive by having a cleaner environment and conditions,"" Rodriguez said. The Cinvestav team said the nanobubble system was also being applied in two water treatment plants. It could also potentially be replicated in other waterways in Mexico City, where water quality is considered poor and supplies are often at the mercy of droughts. The solar panels powering the nanobubble technology sit atop Xochimilco's famous ""trajineras,"" barge-like boats that shuttle tourists through the canals. They also provide onboard electricity. ""It can give us more benefits, both national and international tourism,"" said Miguel Poblano Lugo, a trajinera service provider.

science,"Battery pioneer Akira Yoshino on Tesla, Apple and the electric future"," Aug 24 (Reuters) - Akira Yoshino, a co-winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on lithium-ion batteries, can take credit for the upheaval in both the automotive and technology industries. Lithium-ion batteries have provided the first serious competition in a century to fossil fuels and combustion engines for transportation. Now an honorary fellow at Asahi Kasei, the Japanese chemical firm where he has worked for nearly 50 years, Yoshino sees more disruption ahead as transportation and digital technology become one industry, sharing lithium battery technology. Yoshino spoke with Reuters about about the next generation of electric vehicle batteries, the potential for shared autonomous electric vehicles that can charge themselves, the prospects for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the possibility that Apple could lead the convergence of the automotive and information technology industries in future mobility. Here is an edited transcript: Reuters: What technical innovations ??in design, in chemistry and materials, even in processes ??might keep lithium ion as the dominant EV battery chemistry and for how much longer? Yoshino: There are two major areas of innovation that would be the key. One would be new cathode materials and anode materials. The second one would be the system where the EV is used. In other words, how people will be using the EVs, and how they charge them and discharge them. Reuters: Are you speaking of people using electric vehicles in different ways? That is, not owning vehicles, but paying per use, for instance, through ride sharing? Yoshino: Yes, I think the biggest potential is in sharing. If autonomous electric vehicles can become practical, that will cause a huge change in the way people use vehicles. Reuters: How long before wireless charging of electric vehicle batteries will become a reality, whether it's through the roadbed or solar panels on the vehicle or some other means? Yoshino: The basic technology for wireless charging is not a problem. The problem is how to apply this in a practical system. There are two possibilities. One is cars that are parked in a certain place where wireless charging is available. The second one is while the car is moving. It's probably not going to be on every road, but on certain roads where this is available, that could be possible. If you think of autonomous electric vehicles, the vehicles will know when they need to charge and on their own just go to the charging station. That kind of situation can be practical sooner than you think. Reuters: Toyota and Honda are selling small numbers of fuel cell electric vehicles, but the hydrogen infrastructure to support fuel cells seems like it's many years away. Yoshino: With the fuel cell vehicle, there are challenges on the technology and the costs, but you can overcome them. If you think about the longer term, 2030 to 2050, autonomous shared vehicles are going to come about. Hypothetically, an autonomous vehicle could be run by a gasoline engine, it could be electric, it could be a fuel cell. It doesn't matter what the power source is. But it needs to replenish its energy somehow. If the vehicle can't do that automatically without a human intervention, the system is kind of meaningless. The same thing would be true for gasoline or hydrogen. In that sense, the electric vehicle is the one that can replace its energy automatically. If you think of the Roomba vacuum cleaner, this goes around the room and it goes and recharges itself. If the Roomba needed a person to come and ""fill up the tank,"" nobody would want to buy the Roomba. Reuters: What else should we know about the future of mobility? Yoshino: Right now, the auto industry is thinking about how to invest in the future of mobility. At the same time, the IT industry is also thinking about the future of mobility. Somewhere, sometime, with the auto industry and the IT industry, there is going to be some kind of convergence for the future of mobility. Tesla has their own independent strategy. The one to look out for is Apple. What will they do? I think they may announce something soon. And what kind of car would they announce? What kind of battery? They probably want to get in around 2025. If they do that, I think they have to announce something by the end of this year. That's just my own personal hypothesis. Our Standards: European and U.S. cities planning to phase out combustion engines over the next 15 years first need to plug a charging gap for millions of residents who park their cars on the street."

science,WIDER IMAGE Elon Musk's satellites beam internet into remote Chilean fishing hamlet," SOTOMO, Chile, Aug 19 (Reuters) - After half an hour's windswept journey on foot and by boat through a craggy forested estuary to the school he attends in remote southern Chile, Diego Guerrero can finally access the internet. Picture essay: His school is located in the hamlet of Sotomo, around 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of the capital Santiago in the region of Los Lagos and inhabited by just 20 families. A rain-drenched scattering of brightly painted wooden and tin houses, Sotomo stands out against a mist-swathed row of rocky outcrops jutting out into the Pacific Ocean. It can be accessed only by boat. For decades, its inhabitants have survived by catching mussels and fish to sell at market, a five-hour round-trip away by boat. Now, it is one of two places in Chile to be chosen for a pilot project run by billionaire Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, to receive free internet for a year. Starlink, a division of SpaceX, aims to roll out 12,000 satellites as part of a low-Earth orbiting network to provide low-latency broadband internet services around the world, with a particular focus on remote areas that terrestrial internet infrastructure struggles to reach. Since October, it has been The plan is key to generating the funds that SpaceX needs to fund Musk's For Diego, aged 7, stable internet is a dream enough. ""I really like the internet because we can do homework,"" he said. ""It's faster so we can do more of it."" Starlink did not reply to a Reuters request for comment. SpaceX chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell said in a July statement about the Chilean pilot: ""Starlink was designed for remote communities like those in Caleta Sierra and Sotomo. High-speed connectivity can have a transformational impact on these communities."" BROADENING HORIZONS Diego's favorite subject at school is math. He wants to be a sailor, and loves to go out on his father Carlos's fishing boat. Carlos, 40, has more ambitious plans for his son and hopes the window onto the world the new internet connection will give him will broaden his horizons. He takes Diego to school daily by boat, often battling wind and rain to get him there. ""I didn't have the option of going to school so you do it whatever the conditions, good or bad weather or pandemic, even if it's difficult,"" he said. ""If he has a good education, he has that option and is eager to do it, then you have all the hopes of any father, that maybe one day all the children from Sotomo can go on to professional jobs."" Using tablets provided by the education ministry, the school's seven pupils can now tap into online learning material, watch films, do virtual museum visits and try out video calls to children in other schools. Their sole teacher at Sotomo's John F Kennedy School, Javier de la Barra, said he also looked forward to using it for professional development. The signal is received via a satellite dish installed on the school's roof, which transmits through a Wi-Fi device to most of its facilities and outdoor patio. Eventually, the plan is to extend it to the rest of the hamlet. It only works from noon to midnight, because of a constrained supply of diesel to the generator that supplies power to Sotomo. Nonetheless, said de la Barra, it is a significant advance on the patchy mobile internet signal that residents currently can get on their phones by leaning out of windows or paddling out into the bay. The Starlink antennae was installed in July and inaugurated earlier this month in a ceremony attended by Transport and Telecommunications Minister Gloria Hutt. She said she hoped Starlink would prove key in bridging Chile and the wider region's digital divide - an issue laid bare with the advent of coronavirus lockdowns that left people without good internet struggling to work or study. Chile has among the highest internet penetration rates on the continent, with 21 million mobile internet connections among its population of 19 million as of March 2021, according to government figures. But as the families in Sotomo can attest, having mobile internet does not mean you can always get a signal. ""I love living here,"" said Carlos Guerrero. ""It's tranquil, my family is without stress, but we do lack connectivity, roads, electricity and drinking water. ""What would be great is if all these services could be extended around our community, not just to a small part, so everyone could enjoy them.""

science,Cancer patients' own cells used in 3D printed tumours to test treatments," TEL AVIV, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Researchers have used brain cancer patients' own cells in a form of 3D printing material to make a model of their tumour to test the efficacy of potential treatments before using them for real inside the body. The scientists extract ""a chunk"" of the tumour from the brain of a patient with glioblastoma - an aggressive cancer with a very poor prognosis - and use it to print a model matching their MRI scans, said Professor Ronit Satchi-Fainaro, who led the research at Tel Aviv University. The patient's blood is then pumped through the printed tumour, made with a compound that mimics the brain, followed by a drug or therapeutic treatment. While previous research has used such ""bioprinting"" to simulate cancer environments, the Tel Aviv University researchers say they are the first to print a ""viable"" tumour. ""We have about two weeks (to) test all the different therapies that we would like to evaluate (on) that specific tumour, and get back with an answer - which treatment is predicted to be the best fit,"" Satchi-Fainaro said. A treatment is deemed promising if the printed tumour shrinks or if it lowers metabolic activity against control groups. The research was published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Glioblastoma is the most common form of brain cancer in adults. It spreads quickly to other parts of the brain, making it difficult to treat. Survival is around 40% in the first year after diagnosis and 17% in the second, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Researchers have often 3D printed tumour models to plan for surgery, but more recent innovations have focused on bioprinting, which uses live cells as a sort of ink to build up the layers. Ofra Benny, who leads similar research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the use of a patient's own cells to develop 3D tumour models could be ""a game changer in the field of personalised medicine"". ""The more physiological mimicry you create, the better prediction you get in terms of how drug treatments will work on the actual tumour in the patient's body,"" she said.

science,Well-preserved skeleton sheds light on culture in ancient Pompeii," ROME, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved skeleton at a burial site in Pompeii which has shed new light on funeral rites and cultural activity in the doomed, ancient Roman city, officials said on Tuesday. The body of the man, believed to be in his 60s, was found in a tomb which dated to the final decades of Pompeii, before it was destroyed by the Vesuvius volcano in 79 AD. A commemorative inscription named the man as Marcus Venerius Secundio and made a reference to theatre performances at Pompeii in Greek - the first time archaeologists have found direct evidence of plays performed there in Greek as well as in Latin. ""That performances in Greek were organised is evidence of the lively and open cultural climate which characterised ancient Pompeii,"" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of Pompeii's Archaeological Park. The park said in a statement that it was one of the best preserved skeletons ever found at the site and showed signs of partial mummification, with hair and an ear still evident on the skull. Two cremation urns were also found in the tomb enclosure. Adults were normally cremated in the city at the time, so the burial of Marcus Venerius is seen as highly unusual. Archaeologists are investigating whether the man might have been embalmed ahead of burial. Certain textiles are known to have been used in embalming and archaeologists have found fragments of what might be fabric at the site. Marcus Venerius's name appears in another city archive, which identified him as a public slave and a custodian of the Temple of Venus. He was later freed and his imposing tomb suggests he had reached a certain social and economic status before his death. The burial site is not currently accessible to visitors and lies beyond the city limits. Pompeii officials said they were looking into how they could open the area to the public. Pompeii, 23 km (14 miles) southeast of Naples, was home to about 13,000 people when the volcanic eruption buried it under ash, pumice pebbles and dust, freezing it in time. The site was not discovered until the 16th century and organised excavations began around 1750. A recent burst of archaeological activity, aimed at halting years of decay and neglect, has enabled scholars to uncover areas that have previously remained buried under the volcanic debris.

The female cub, named Sparta, was found at the Semyuelyakh River in Russia's Yakutia region in 2018 and a second lion cub called Boris was found the year before, according to a study published in the Quaternary journal. The cubs were found 15 metres apart but are not only from different litters but were also born thousands of years apart. Boris, a male cub, lived around 43,448 years ago, the study said. The two cubs aged 1-2 months were found by mammoth tusk collectors. Two other lion cubs named Uyan and Dina have also been found in the region in recent years. Cave lions have been extinct for thousands of years. Valery Plotnikov, one of the study's authors, told Reuters in the regional capital Yakutsk that Sparta was so well preserved that it still had its fur, internal organs and skeleton. ""The find itself is unique; there was no any other such find in Yakutia,"" he said. ""Maybe, we hope, some disintegrated parts of the mother's milk (remain intact). Because if we have that, we can understand what its mother's diet was,"" he said. Similar finds in Russia's vast Siberian region have happened with increasing regularity.

science,Indonesian village turns unwanted trash into COVID helper," TEMBOK GEDE, Indonesia, Aug 11 (Reuters) - A homemade robot designed by Indonesian villagers and scientists for fun has found a new use during the pandemic - bringing food, and hopefully a smile, to self-isolating residents who have contracted COVID-19. An eclectic assembly of household items like pots, pans and an old television monitor, it is now named the ""Delta robot"" in a nod to the highly contagious variant of the coronavirus that has ripped through Indonesia. ""With this new Delta variant and the surging number of COVID-19 cases, I decided to turn the robot into one used for public services such as to spray disinfectant, deliver food and meet the needs of residents who are self-isolating,"" Aseyanto, 53, a neighbourhood leader who heads the project, said. The robot's head is made from a rice cooker, and it is operated by remote control with a 12-hour battery life. It is one of several robots made in the village of Tembok Gede, which has won a reputation for its creative use of technology. After trundling down the street to the home of an isolating resident, its speaker emits the message ""assalamu?�alaikum"" (Peace be with you), followed by ""A delivery is here. Get well soon."" The village lies within Surabaya, capital of East Java province and Indonesia's second-biggest city, where a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections has swept in over in the past month. Indonesia has become the epicentre of Asia's COVID-19 outbreak and recorded more than 3.68 million infections and more than 108,000 deaths from the virus among a population in excess of 270 million spread across the vast archipelago. ""This Delta robot is very simple.... When we created this, we purely used used materials in our neighborhood,"" said Aseyanto, who goes by one name. It is a far cry from the robots deployed in hospitality and for care in Japan and elsewhere, some of which have been adapted to help tackle the pandemic.

science,Prehistoric cave paintings in Spain show Neanderthals were artists," ARDALES, Spain, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Neanderthals may have been closer to our species of prehistoric modern human than previously believed after cave paintings found in Spain proved they had a fondness for creating art, one of the authors of a new scientific report said on Sunday. Red ochre pigment discovered on stalagmites in the Caves of Ardales, near Malaga in southern Spain, were created by Neanderthals about 65,000 years ago, making them possibly the first artists on earth, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal. Modern humans were not inhabiting Europe at the time the cave images were made. The new findings add to increasing evidence that Neanderthals, whose lineage became extinct about 40,000 years ago, were not the unsophisticated relatives of Homo sapiens they had long been portrayed as. Pigments were made in the caves at different times up to 15,000 and 20,000 years apart, the study found, and dispel an earlier suggestion that they were the result of a natural oxide flow rather than being man-made. Joao Zilhao, one of the authors of the PNAS study, said dating techniques showed that ochre had been spat by Neanderthals onto the stalagmites, possibly as part of a ritual. ""The importance is that it changes our attitude towards Neanderthals. They were closer to humans. Recent research has shown they liked objects, they mated with humans and now we can show that they painted caves like us,"" he said. Wall paintings made by prehistoric modern humans, such as those found in the Chauvet-Pont d?�Arc cave of France, are more than 30,000 years old.

science,Geological analysis explains durability of Stonehenge megaliths," Aug 4 (Reuters) - The first comprehensive scientific analysis of Stonehenge's imposing megaliths has revealed some of the traits that made them an exemplary building material for the famed monument in southern England including their stout resistance to weathering. Researchers on Wednesday described a battery of examinations that provided a glimpse inside one of Stonehenge's 52 sandstone megaliths, known as sarsens, gaining insight into its geology and chemistry. They studied a core sample extracted from one of the sarsens, called Stone 58, during 1950s conservation work. It was kept in the United States for decades before being returned to Britain for research in 2018. The sarsens are made of stone called silcrete that formed gradually within a few yards (meters) of the ground surface as a result of groundwater washing through buried sediment. The examination clarified Stone 58's internal structure. It showed that the silcrete is comprised of mainly sand-sized quartz grains cemented tightly together by an interlocking mosaic of quartz crystals. Quartz is extremely durable and does not easily crumble or erode even when exposed to eons of wind and weather. ""This explains the stone's resistance to weathering and why it made an ideal material for monument-building,"" said University of Brighton geomorphologist David Nash, who led the study published in the journal PLoS ONE. In a remarkable engineering achievement by late Neolithic people, the sarsens were erected at the site in Wiltshire, England around 2500 BC. Stone 58, one of the giant upright sarsens at Stonehenge's center, stands about 7 meters (23 feet) tall, with another 2 meters (7 feet) underground, and an estimated above-ground weight of 24 tons. The core sample is a rod of stone, about an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter and roughly a yard (meter) long. Its cream color is brighter than the pale-gray exterior of the megaliths, which have been exposed to the elements for millennia. It was given as a souvenir to a man named Robert Phillips who worked for a company involved in the conservation work and was on-site during drilling. Phillips took it with him with permission when he emigrated to the United States in 1977. Phillips decided to return it to Britain for research in 2018. He died in 2020. ""Getting access to the core drilled from Stone 58 was very much the Holy Grail for our research,"" Nash said. ""All the previous work on sarsens at Stonehenge involved samples either excavated from the site or knocked off from random stones."" The researchers used CT-scanning, X-rays, microscopic analyses and various geochemical techniques to study fragments and wafer-thin slices of the core sample - such testing being off limits for megaliths at the site. ""This small sample is now probably the most analyzed piece of stone other than moon rock,"" Nash said. It remains unclear precisely when the rock formed, though the researchers found that some embedded sand grains dated to as long ago as the Mesoproterozoic Era, 1 billion to 1.6 billion years ago. Nash led ""I think Stonehenge has fascinated archaeologists and other scientists for centuries now, partly because we don't know what it was used for exactly, and there are a number of theories as to why the site was built,"" Nash said. ""It's a site that is still rich with possibilities for doing more research.""

science,International Space Station thrown out of control by misfire of Russian module -NASA," July 29 (Reuters) - The International Space Station (ISS) was thrown briefly out of control on Thursday when jet thrusters of a newly arrived Russian research module inadvertently fired a few hours after it was docked to the orbiting outpost, NASA officials said. The seven crew members aboard - two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a European space agency astronaut from France - were never in any immediate danger, according to NASA and Russian state-owned news agency RIA. But the malfunction prompted NASA to postpone Thursday's mishap began about three hours after the multipurpose Nauka module had latched onto the space station, as mission controllers in Moscow were performing some post-docking ""reconfiguration"" procedures, according to NASA. The module's jets inexplicably restarted, causing the entire station to pitch out of its normal flight position some 250 miles above the Earth, leading the mission's flight director to declare a ""spacecraft emergency,"" U.S. space agency officials said. Slideshow: Images from space An unexpected drift in the station's orientation was first detected by automated ground sensors, followed 15 minutes later by a ""loss of attitude control"" that lasted a little over 45 minutes, according to Joel Montalbano, manager of NASA's space station program. 'TUG-OF-WAR' Flight teams on the ground managed to restore the space station's orientation by activating thrusters on another module of the orbiting platform, NASA officials said. In its broadcast coverage of the incident, RIA cited NASA specialists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as describing the struggle to regain control of the space station as a ""tug of war"" between the two modules. At the height of the incident, the station was pitching out of alignment at the rate of about a half a degree per second, Montalbano said during a NASA conference call with reporters. The Nauka engines were ultimately switched off, the space station was stabilized and its orientation was restored to where it had begun, NASA said. Communication with the crew was lost for several minutes twice during the disruption, but ""there was no immediate danger at any time to the crew,"" Montalbano said. He said ""the crew really didn't feel any movement."" Had the situation become so dangerous as to require evacuation of personnel, the crew could have escaped in a SpaceX crew capsule still parked at the outpost and designed to serve as a ""lifeboat"" if necessary, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. What caused the malfunction of the thrusters on the Nauka module, delivered by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, has yet to be determined, NASA officials said. Montalbano said there was no immediate sign of any damage to the space station. The flight correction maneuvers used up more propellant reserves than desired, ""but nothing I would worry about,"" he said. After its launch last week from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, the module experienced a series of glitches that raised concern about whether the docking procedure would go smoothly. Roscosmos attributed Thursday's post-docking issue to Nauka's engines having to work with residual fuel in the craft, TASS news agency reported. ""The process of transferring the Nauka module from flight mode to 'docked with ISS' mode is underway. Work is being carried out on the remaining fuel in the module,"" Roscosmos was cited by TASS as saying. The Nauka module is designed to serve as a research lab, storage unit and airlock that will upgrade Russia's capabilities aboard the ISS. A live broadcast showed the module, named after the Russian word for ""science,"" docking with the space station a few minutes later than scheduled. ""According to telemetry data and reports from the ISS crew, the onboard systems of the station and the Nauka module are operating normally,"" Roscosmos said in a statement. ""There is contact!!!""

science,Boeing postpones Starliner launch after new glitch," Aug 3 (Reuters) - Boeing Co Boeing engineers ruled out ""a number of potential causes, including software,"" but were still working to understand the source of ""unexpected valve position indications"" in the propulsion system, Boeing said in a statement Tuesday evening. ""Additional time is needed to complete the assessment,"" Boeing said, adding that it would also not proceed with the next potential launch window on Wednesday. The delay of Tuesday's uncrewed test flight throws into question the timing of Boeing's follow-on mission with a crew onboard, which Boeing has said would take place no earlier than December. Boeing engineers detected the valve position problem during Tuesday's pre-launch preparations, while making checks after electrical storms in the region, Boeing said in a statement. ""We're going to let the data lead our work,"" said John Vollmer, the program's manager. ""We will not launch until our vehicle is performing nominally and our teams are confident it is ready to fly."" The Starliner capsule loaded with supplies had been due to blast off atop an Atlas V rocket flown by the United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp The launch was originally planned for last Friday, but was postponed by NASA after the space station was briefly thrown out of control with seven crew members aboard, a mishap caused by the inadvertent reignition of jet thrusters on a newly docked Russian service module. Russia's space agency blamed a software glitch. The uncrewed mission was intended as a precursor to crewed flight potentially to be conducted before the end of the year. It was the latest setback for a U.S. aerospace giant reeling from back-to-back crises - a pandemic that crushed demand for new jetliners and a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes - that have damaged Boeing's finances and engineering reputation. Boeing was powering down the spacecraft on Tuesday evening, and planned to roll the rocket and spacecraft back to the Vertical Integration Facility on Wednesday for further inspection and testing ""to inform the next steps,"" Boeing said. The Starliner capsule headlined Boeing's efforts against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX to be the first to return NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. But a series of software glitches during the December 2019 debut launch resulted in its failure to dock at the orbital laboratory outpost. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has gone on to launch three crewed space station missions since 2020, with a fourth scheduled as early as Oct. 31, according to NASA. Boeing has spent a year and a half correcting issues flagged during NASA reviews, part of the U.S. space agency's strategy to ensure access to the sprawling international research satellite some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. NASA in 2014 awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own capsules that could fly American astronauts to the space station in an effort to wean the United States off its dependence on Russia's Soyuz vehicles for rides to space following the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. The capsule had been loaded for the 24-hour trip to the station with a flight test dummy nicknamed ""Rosie the Rocketeer,"" and about 760 pounds of cargo, Boeing said.

science,Teenage girls in northern Nigeria 'open their minds' with robotics," KANO, Nigeria, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Teenage girls in the northern Nigerian city of Kano are learning robotics, computing and other STEM subjects as part of an innovative project that challenges local views of what girls should be doing in a socially conservative Muslim society. In a place where girls are expected to marry young and their education is often cut short, the Kabara NGO aims to widen their world view through activities such as building machines, using common software programmes and learning about maths and science. ""I came to Kabara to learn robotics and I have created a lot of things,"" said Fatima Zakari, 12. One of her creations is a battery-powered spin art device to create distinctive artwork. ""I am happy to share this with my younger ones and the community at large for the growth of the society,"" she said proudly. Kabara is the brainchild of engineer Hadiza Garbati, who wanted to raise the aspirations of northern Nigerian girls and help them develop skills they might harness to start their own small businesses or enroll at university. Since it started in Kano in 2016, Kabara has trained more than 200 girls, and Garbati is working on expanding her project to other northern cities. It is a rare educational success story in northern Nigeria, where more than 1,000 children have been kidnapped from their schools by ransom seekers since December, causing many more to drop out because their parents are fearful of abductions. Kabara, located in a safe area in the heart of Kano, has been unaffected by the crisis. Garbati said she had overcome resistance from some parents by being highly respectful of Islamic traditions. The girls wear their hijabs during sessions. Crucial to her success has been support from Nasiru Wada, a close adviser to the Emir of Kano, a figurehead who has moral authority in the community. Wada holds the traditional title of Magajin Garin Kano. ""The main reason why we are doing this is to encourage them, to open their minds,"" said Wada. ""Tradition, not to say discourages, but does not put enough emphasis on the education of the girl child, with the belief that oh, at a certain age, she will get married,"" he said. ""It is good to encourage the girl child to study not only the humanities but the science subjects as well because we need healthcare workers, we need science teachers,"" he said, adding that even married women needed skills to manage their affairs.

science,Sponge-like Canadian fossils may be earliest sign of animal life," WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - Fossils found in rugged mountainous terrain in Canada's Northwest Territories may give a glimpse at the humble dawn of animal life on Earth - sea sponges that inhabited primordial reefs built by bacteria roughly 890 million years ago. A Canadian researcher said on Wednesday the fossils, dating to a time called the Neoproterozoic Period, appear to show distinctive microstructures from the body of a sea sponge built similarly to a species living today called the Mediterranean bath sponge, or Spongia officinalis. If this interpretation is correct, these would be the oldest fossils of animal life by roughly 300 million years. ""The earliest animals to emerge evolutionarily were probably sponge-like. This is not surprising given that sponges are the most basic type of animal both today and in the fossil record,"" said geologist Elizabeth Turner of Laurentian University in Canada, who conducted the study published in the journal Nature. The Earth formed more than 4.5 billion years ago. The first life forms were bacteria-like single-celled marine organisms that arose hundreds of millions of years later. Complex life evolved relatively late in Earth's history. The first appearance of rudimentary animal life has been a much-debated topic in terms of its timing and form. An enigmatic ribbed, pancake-shaped organism called Dickinsonia known from fossils dating to roughly 575 million years ago has been considered a candidate as the earliest-known animal. Turner said she believes animals evolved much earlier than the present fossil record indicates. ""The existence of a protracted back-history is not surprising, but the sheer duration of it - a few hundred million years - may be a little unexpected for some researchers,"" Turner said. When people think of animals, a sponge may not immediately come to mind. But sponges - aquatic invertebrates that live fixed to the sea floor and possess soft, porous bodies with internal skeletons - are among the most successful animal groups. ""They lack a nervous, digestive and circulatory system. They have an amazing water-pumping machine, produced by specialized cells, that they use to move seawater through their bodies to filter-feed,"" Turner said. Some sponges have skeletons made of microscopic rods of quartz or calcite. Others have skeletons made of a tough protein called spongin that forms a complex three-dimensional meshwork supporting the animal's soft tissue. The Canadian fossils represent this latter kind, called a horny sponge. ""It is the relict structure of the 3-D meshwork spongin skeleton that is preserved and that is so distinctive,"" Turner said. This structure, visible under the microscope, consists of tiny tubes that branch and rejoin to form the meshwork. The body size for the sponge would have been roughly four-tenths of an inch (1 cm). Turner said the sponges appear to have lived in cavities just below the reef surface and in surface depressions. If these fossils genuinely show a type of sponge, their age would indicate that Earth's first animals evolved before a pair of landmark events usually seen as predating animal life. One of these was the second of two episodes in the planet's history when the amount of atmospheric oxygen greatly increased, sometime between about 830 and 540 million years ago. The other was a tremendously cold time when Earth may have been encased in ice or at least partially frozen over, sometime between about 720 and 635 million years ago. The fossils predate by about 350 million years what had been the oldest-known sponge fossils. Turner noted that genetic research indicates that sponges first appeared at approximately the time to which these fossils date.

science,Bezos offers NASA $2 billion in exchange for moon mission contract," SEATTLE, July 26 (Reuters) - Fresh off his trip to space, billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos on Monday offered to cover up to $2 billion in NASA costs if the U.S. space agency awards his company Blue Origin a contract to make a spacecraft designed to land astronauts back on the moon. NASA The space agency cited its own funding shortfalls, SpaceX's proven record of orbital missions and other factors in a contract decision that senior NASA official Kathy Lueders called ""what's the best value to the government."" In a letter to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said Blue Origin would waive payments in the government's current fiscal year and the next ones after that up to $2 billion, and pay for an orbital mission to vet its technology. In exchange, Blue Origin would accept a firm, fixed-priced contract, and cover any system development cost overruns, Bezos said. ""NASA veered from its original dual-source acquisition strategy due to perceived near-term budgetary issues, and this offer removes that obstacle,"" Bezos wrote. ""Without competition, NASA's short-term and long-term lunar ambitions will be delayed, will ultimately cost more, and won't serve the national interest,"" Bezos added. A NASA spokesperson said the agency was aware of Bezos' letter but declined to comment further, citing the protest Blue Origin filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office accusing the agency of giving SpaceX an unfair advantage by allowing it to revise its pricing. The GAO's decision is expected by early August, though industry sources said Blue Origin views the possibility of a reversal as unlikely. A SpaceX spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Before choosing SpaceX, NASA had asked for proposals for a spacecraft that would carry astronauts to the lunar surface under its Artemis program to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972.

science,Father builds exoskeleton to help wheelchair-bound son walk," PARIS, July 26 (Reuters) - ""Robot, stand up"" - Oscar Constanza, 16, gives the order and slowly but surely a large frame strapped to his body lifts him up and he starts walking. Fastened to his shoulders, chest, waist, knees and feet, the exoskeleton allows Oscar - who has a genetic neurological condition that means his nerves do not send enough signals to his legs - to walk across the room and turn around. ""Before, I needed someone to help me walk ... this makes me feel independent,"" said Oscar, as his father Jean-Louis Constanza, one of the co-founders of the company that makes the exoskeleton, looks on. ""One day Oscar said to me: 'dad, you're a robotic engineer, why don't you make a robot that would allow us to walk?'"" his father recalls, speaking at the company Wandercraft's headquarters in Paris. ""Ten years from now, there will be no, or far fewer, wheelchairs,"" he said. Other companies across the world are also manufacturing exoskeletons, competing to make them as light and usable as possible. Some are focused on helping disabled people walk, others on a series of applications, including making standing less tiring for factory workers. Wandercraft's exoskeleton, an outer frame that supports but also simulates body movement, has been sold to dozens of hospitals in France, Luxembourg and the United States, for about 150,000 euros ($176,000) a piece, Constanza said. It cannot yet be bought by private individuals for everyday use - that is the next stage the company is working on. A personal skeleton would need to be much lighter, Wandercraft engineers said.

science,Boeing's Starliner ready for crucial do-over launch to orbit," SEATTLE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Boeing Co's Tuesday's planned uncrewed mission is a precursor to a closely watched crewed flight potentially to be conducted before the end of the year. It also marks a key trial for the U.S. aerospace giant after back-to-back crises - a pandemic that crushed demand for new planes and a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes - that have damaged Boeing's finances and engineering reputation. If all goes according to plan, the Starliner capsule loaded with supplies will blast off atop an Atlas V rocket flown by the United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp The launch Atlas V's dual Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines are poised to shoot Starliner on a 113-mile (98 nautical miles/181 km) suborbital trajectory before the capsule separates and flies under its own power to the space station in a roughly 24-hour overall journey. The Starliner capsule headlined Boeing's efforts against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX to be the first to return NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. But a series of software glitches during the December 2019 debut launch resulted in its failure to dock at the orbital laboratory outpost. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has gone on to launch three crewed space station missions since 2020, with a fourth slated as early as Oct. 31, according to NASA. Boeing has spent a year and a half correcting issues flagged during NASA reviews, part of the U.S. space agency's strategy to ensure access to the sprawling international research satellite some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. NASA in 2014 awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own capsules that could fly American astronauts to the space station in an effort to wean the United States off its dependence on Russia's Soyuz vehicles for rides to space following the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011. If all goes well, Boeing will bring the capsule home on Aug. 9, and then attempt the follow-on crewed mission that the company has said will take place no earlier than December.

science,SpaceX lands NASA launch contract for mission to Jupiter's moon Europa," LOS ANGELES, July 23 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's private rocket company SpaceX was awarded a $178 million launch services contract for NASA's first mission focusing on Jupiter's icy moon Europa and whether it may host conditions suitable for life, the space agency said on Friday. The Europa Clipper mission is due for blastoff in October 2024 on a Falcon Heavy rocket owned by Musk's company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp, from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said in a statement posted online. The contract marked NASA's latest vote of confidence in the Hawthorne, California-based company, which has carried several  cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA in recent years. In April, SpaceX was awarded a $2.9 billion contract to build the lunar lander spacecraft for the planned Artemis program that would carry NASA astronauts back to the moon for the first time since 1972. But that contract was suspended after two rival space companies, Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics Inc, protested against the SpaceX selection. The company's partly reusable 23-story Falcon Heavy, currently the most powerful operational space launch vehicle in the world, flew its first commercial payload into orbit in 2019. NASA did not say what other companies may have bid on the Europa Clipper launch contract. The probe is to conduct a detailed survey of the ice-covered Jovian satellite, which is a bit smaller than Earth's moon and is a leading candidate in the search for life elsewhere in the solar system. A bend in Europa's magnetic field observed by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in 1997 appeared to have been caused by a geyser gushing through the moon's frozen crust from a vast subsurface ocean, researchers concluded in 2018. Those findings supported other evidence of Europa plumes. Among the Clipper mission's objectives are to produce high-resolution images of Europa's surface, determine its composition, look for signs of geologic activity, measure the thickness of its icy shell and determine the depth and salinity of its ocean, NASA said.

science,Dutch teen on space flight told Bezos he had never ordered from Amazon," AMSTERDAM, July 23 (Reuters) - The Dutch teenager who became the world's youngest space traveller this week surprised billionaire Jeff Bezos on the flight by telling him he'd never ordered anything on Amazon.com. Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old physics student, accompanied Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos and 82-year-old female aviator Wally Funk - the oldest person to go to space - on a 10-minute trip beyond Earth's atmosphere. Bezos funded exploration company Blue Origin by selling billions of dollars' worth of stock in his online delivery business Amazon. ""I told Jeff, like, I've actually never bought something from Amazon,"" Daemen told Reuters in an interview on Friday at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. ""And he was like, 'oh, wow, it's a long time ago I heard someone say that'."" Daemen, who was picked after another candidate bidding $28 million for the ride cancelled at the last minute, found out he would be joining the flight while on a family holiday in Italy. ""They called and said: Are you still interested?' and we were like 'Yes! Yes! Yes!'"" Daemen had dreamt of space travel since he was a kid, followed every development by space exploration companies like Blue Origin and got his pilot's licence at a young age.

The crew received two days of safety training, but nothing very hard, said Daemen, who can be seen in a video of the trip tossing ping-pong balls in weightlessness with Jeff Bezos. ""That was super cool. It's so weird to be weightless. It was easier than I had expected. It was kind of like being in water."" Daemen, who is set to start at Utrecht University in September, said he was not sure what he wanted to do later in life, but would seriously consider a career in space travel.

science,Russia blames software glitch after space station briefly thrown out of control," MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - A software glitch, and possible lapse in human attention, were to blame for throwing the International Space Station out of control, but work was proceeding to activate a newly attached module at the centre of the mishap, Russian space officials said on Friday. Jet thrusters on the Russian research module Nauka inadvertently reignited on Thursday a few hours after it had docked to the space station, causing the entire orbital outpost to pitch out of its normal flight position some 250 miles above the Earth with seven crew members aboard. According to NASA's account of the incident, the mission flight director immediately declared a spaceflight emergency as engineers on the ground struggled to regain stability of the sprawling research satellite. Attitude control over the station was lost for 45 minutes, as ground-based flight teams activated thrusters on another module of the outpost and on a separate cargo ship previously docked to the complex to restore its proper alignment, NASA told reporters on Thursday. During that time station, which measures the length of an American football field, was slowly pitching end-over-end at a peak rate of about half a degree per second, equivalent to nearly four rotations per hour, according to NASA. Communication with the crew also was lost twice for several minutes during the emergency. On Friday, Vladimir Solovyov, designer general at Energia, a Russian space agency company, sought to reassure international partners that the incident had been contained and said cosmonauts would have Nauka - the Russian word for ""science"" - up and running soon. ""Due to a short-term software failure, a direct command was mistakenly implemented to turn on the module's engines for withdrawal, which led to some modification of the orientation of the complex as a whole,"" he said in a statement. 'HUMAN FACTOR' ""The crew is now busy balancing the pressure in the Nauka module. In the afternoon, the crew will open the hatches, enter the module, turn on the necessary means of purifying the atmosphere and begin normal regular work."" Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said later that human inattentiveness could have been involved. ""Everything was going well but there was a human factor. There was some euphoria (after successful docking), everybody got relaxed,"" he was quoted as saying by the Komsomolskaya Pravda website. NASA and Roscosmos each said that the seven crew members aboard - two Russian cosmonauts, three U.S. astronauts and two others from Japan and France - were never in any immediate danger. Both agencies also said the situation was resolved in relatively short order with no apparent damage to the space station. But NASA space station program manager Joel Montalbano said he could recall only two or three previous occasions in the 20-plus-year history of the orbiting laboratory that the thrusters of a docked vehicle or module had misfired like that. The mishap also prompted NASA to postpone the planned launch of Boeing Co's Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky, who is on board, on Friday told his followers on Twitter not to worry. ""Dear friends, I?�m reading your numerous comments. Don?�t worry! Our work at the International Space Station to integrate the newly arrived Nauka module continues! Tonight we are going to open the hatches. Will keep you posted!"" Roscosmos said checks on Nauka's engines were being completed remotely by Russian specialists to ensure continued safety and that the station was on its normal flight trajectory. It said that the module docking had been otherwise successful. Rogozin, head of Roscosmos, had hailed Nauka's arrival the previous day as ""a very difficult and important victory for us"" and warmly accepted congratulations on Twitter from space entrepreneur Elon Musk. Rogozin also spoke of plans to launch another Russian module to the station in November.

science,"Modern crocodile's 'grandfather,' 150 million years old, discovered in Chile fossil"," BUENOS AIRES, July 23 (Reuters) - A 150-million-year-old fossilized skeleton discovered in the mountains of southern Chile was determined to be the ancestor of the modern crocodile, the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences announced on Friday. The species, named Burkesuchus mallingrandensis, was found in 2014 in an Andean fossil deposit near the Patagonian town of Mallin Grande by Argentine and Chilean researchers. Since then it has been analyzed at the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences (MACN) in Buenos Aires. The specimen is a ""grandfather"" of current crocodiles and should allow scientists to understand how they evolved, the museum said. Scientists believe the fossil will help them understand how these reptiles went from being terrestrial to aquatic. Along with other fossils, the discovery supports the idea that South America was the cradle of evolution for crocodiles. About 200 million years ago ""crocodiles were smaller, and did not live in water. Paleontologists always wanted to know what that transition was like,"" Federico Agnolin, who found the specimen, told Reuters. ""What Burkesuchus shows is a series of unique traits, which no other crocodile has because they were the first that began to get into the water, into fresh water,"" Agnolin said. According to the MACN, crocodiles appeared at the beginning of the Jurassic period, around the time of the first dinosaurs. In a few million years they got into the water, thanks to the existence of warm and shallow seas. South America is known for its richness in marine crocodile fossils.

science,"""There is contact!"" -Russia's new Nauka space module docks with ISS"," MOSCOW, July 29 (Reuters) - Russia upgraded its capabilities on the International Space Station on Thursday after its new Nauka module, set to serve as a research lab, storage unit and airlock, successfully docked with it after a nervy journey from Earth. A live broadcast from Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, showed the module, a multipurpose laboratory named after the Russian word for 'science', docking with the ISS at 1329 GMT, a few minutes later than scheduled. ""According to telemetry data and reports from the ISS crew, the onboard systems of the station and the Nauka module are operating normally,"" Roscosmos said in a statement. ""There is contact!!!"" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, wrote on Twitter moments after the docking. Since it launch last week from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, the module had suffered a series of glitches that had raised concerns about whether the docking procedure would go smoothly. Thursday's development suggests Russia is interested in maintaining the ISS despite previous comments from Rogozin who last month suggested Moscow would withdraw from it in 2025 unless Washington lifted sanctions on the space sector that he said were hampering Russian satellite launches. Launched in 1998, the ISS is a multinational project and comprises two segments, a Russian one and another one used by the United States and other space agencies. ""After its commissioning, the Russian segment will receive additional room for arranging workplaces, storing cargo and housing water and oxygen regeneration equipment,"" Roscosmos said its statement.

science,Space station mishap prompts NASA to postpone launch of Boeing Starliner," July 29 (Reuters) - NASA on Thursday postponed a planned launch of a Boeing The Starliner launch delay was announced a day before it was due for blastoff from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop a Boeing Lockheed Martin Corp ""We wanted to make sure we had some breathing room to fully assess the situation on (the space) station before adding another vehicle to the ISS configuration,"" Kathy Lueders, an associate NASA administrator, told reporters during a conference call. The Atlas V rocket and Starliner capsule were being kept on the launch pad for the time being, NASA said. A previous uncrewed Starliner test launch to orbit in 2019 ended with a nearly catastrophic failure of that spacecraft to dock with the space station. The countdown to a do-over test flight was halted after difficulties arose with the newly arrived Russian laboratory module Nauka, which had docked with the orbiting space station a few hours earlier. A few hours after Nauka had latched onto the space station, a number of its jet thrusters inadvertently began firing, causing the entire station to pitch out of its normal flight position in orbit, according to Joel Montalbano, manager of NASA's space station program. ""Loss of attitudinal control"" of the space station, with seven crew members aboard, lasted just over 45 minutes, until flight teams on the ground were able to restore the station's orientation with control thrusters, Montalbano told reporters. He said at the height of the incident, the station was pitching out of alignment at the rate of about a half a degree per second. Communication with the crew - consisting of two Russian cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and a French astronaut - was lost briefly twice during that interval, but ""there was no immediate danger at any time to the crew,"" Montalbano said. What caused the thrusters of the Nauka module, delivered by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, to malfunction has yet to be determined, NASA officials said. Montalbano added there was no immediate sign of any damage to the space station from the mishap. The loss of the space station's normal orientation was first detected by automatic sensors on the ground, and ""the crew really didn't feel any movement,"" he said.

science,Marsquakes reveal the anatomy of the Red Planet's interior," WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Seismic waves from quakes detected by NASA's robotic InSight lander have helped scientists decipher the anatomy of Mars, including the first estimates of the size of its large liquid metal core, thickness of its crust, and nature of its mantle. The findings disclosed on Thursday shed light on what had been a poorly understood internal structure of Earth's smaller neighbor and provided a few surprises as well as confirmation that the Red Planet's center is molten. The Waves generated by quakes vary in speed and shape when journeying through different material inside a planet. Data from InSight's seismometer instrument covering about three dozen marsquakes enabled the contours of the planet's interior to come into focus. ""The real importance of these findings is that, for the first time, we actually have measurements of dimensions - sizes - of the fundamental building blocks of the planet Mars,"" said planetary geophysicist Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the InSight mission's principal investigator. ""Before this, all we had were comparisons with Earth, theoretical calculations and indirect inferences from other observations like the trace isotope chemistry of Martian meteorites,"" Banerdt added. The Martian core, the innermost geologic layer, was found to have a diameter of approximately 2,275 miles (3,660 km), larger than previously thought. This suggests that the core, made up mostly of iron and nickel, is less dense than previously known, with lighter elements such as sulfur, oxygen, carbon and hydrogen representing an unexpectedly large proportion. The Martian crust, the outermost layer, is geologically quite different from Earth's. Our planet's crust is divided into immense plates that move inexorably over a rocky inner layer called a mantle in a process called plate tectonics. Crust at certain spots below Earth's oceans is constantly recycled. ""Since we don't have active plate tectonics on Mars, nothing similar is happening there. This also means that the crust of Mars is very old,"" said seismologist Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun of the University of Cologne in Germany, who led one of the three studies on the Martian interior published in the journal Science. The global average crust thickness was found to be 15-50 miles (24-72 km). There was significant variability in the thickness, with a difference of roughly 60 miles (100 km) between the minimum in a region called the Isidis impact basin and the maximum beneath a region called the Tharsis volcanoes. ""The crust at the landing site consists of at least two layers, and the global average crustal thickness is less than predicted by some previous models. The crust is rather thin,"" Knapmeyer-Endrun said. Earth's crust thickness also varies, between almost zero near deep underwater mid-ocean ridges, where new crust is formed, to about 50 miles (80 km) beneath the Himalayas. The Martian mantle, sandwiched between the crust and core, extends roughly 970 miles (1,560 kilometers) below the surface. Its composition differs from Earth's, suggesting the two planets arose from different material when they formed more than 4.5 billion years ago. Mars, the Banerdt said the new findings allow scientists to test theories of planet formation. ""The understanding we will gain from this,"" Banerdt said, ""will apply not only to Mars but to the formation and history of the Earth and any other rocky planet in our solar system or beyond.""

science,Moon-forming region seen around planet in another solar system," July 22 (Reuters) - Scientists for the first time have spotted a moon-forming region around a planet beyond our solar system - a Jupiter-like world surrounded by a disk of gas and dust massive enough that it could spawn three moons the size of the one orbiting Earth. The researchers used the ALMA observatory in Chile's Atacama desert to detect the disk of swirling material accumulating around one of two newborn planets seen orbiting a young star called PDS 70, located a relatively close 370 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). It is called a circumplanetary disk, and it is from these that moons are born. The discovery, the researchers said, offers a deeper understanding about the formation of planets and moons. More than 4,400 planets have been discovered outside our solar system, called exoplanets. No circumplanetary disks had been found until now because all the known exoplanets resided in ""mature"" - fully developed - solar systems, except the two infant gas planets orbiting PDS 70. ""These observations are unique - so far - and have been long waited for, in order to test the theory of planet formation and directly observe the birth of planets and of their satellites,"" said astronomer Myriam Benisty of the University of Grenoble, who led the study published on Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. In our solar system, the impressive rings of Saturn, a planet around which more than 80 moons orbit, represent a relic of a primordial moon-forming disk, said study co-author Stefano Facchini of the European Southern Observatory. The orange-colored star PDS 70, roughly the same mass as our sun, is about 5 million years old - a blink of the eye in cosmic time. The two planets are even younger. Both planets are similar (although larger) to Jupiter, a gas giant that is our solar system's biggest planet. It was around one of the two planets, called PDS 70c, that a moon-forming disk was observed. Researchers previously had found initial evidence of a disk around this planet, but now have confirmed it. Both planets are ""still in their youth,"" Facchini said, and are at a dynamic stage in which they are still acquiring their atmospheres. PDS 70c orbits its star at 33 times the distance of the Earth from the sun, similar to the planet Neptune in our solar system. Benisty said there are possible additional so-far undetected planets in the system. Stars burst to life within clouds of interstellar gas and dust scattered throughout galaxies. Leftover material spinning around a new star then coalesces into planets, and circumplanetary disks surrounding some planets similarly yield moons. The dominant mechanism thought to underpin planet formation is called ""core accretion,"" said study co-author Richard Teague of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ""In this scenario, small dust grains, coated in ice, gradually grow to larger and larger sizes through successive collisions with other grains. This continues until the grains have grown to a size of a planetary core, at which point the young planet has a strong enough gravitational potential to accrete gas which will form its atmosphere,"" Teague said. Some nascent planets attract a disk of material around them, with the same process that gives rise to planets around a star leading to the formation of moons around planets. The disk around PDS 70c, with a diameter about equal to the distance of the Earth to the sun, possesses enough mass to produce up to three moons the size of Earth's moon. It is unclear how many will form, if any.

Unfortunately, social distancing robs us of one of the primary mechanisms we have to adapt to stress, which has led to an increase in loneliness. Q: How have leaders handled the pandemic? A: It has been interesting to see the rises and falls of leaders over the course of the last year. Some have demonstrated strong leadership, and then had difficulty at other times. It is hard to maintain in the face of all these economic and social troubles. What is very important right now is to be a clear and effective communicator, who leads with the heart. Look at Joe Biden, who has made empathy the core of his administration. Q: Is it possible to lead teams effectively, when so many people are working remotely? A: That's the No. 1 question for business leaders right now, and I feel it myself in my own lab. What we have seen is that people are just as productive, if not more so, than they were in the office. But innovation has been falling dramatically, in large part because we don't have ""watercooler"" conversations anymore - those spontaneous moments where you can cook up new ideas. That's hard to manufacture in a remote environment. Q: Are people born leaders, or can that be learned? A: Everybody's dials are set a little differently, and those dials can be turned. For instance, a key part of being a leader is the ability to connect and relate to other people: You can turn that dial up by exercising those faculties, and doing it intentionally. Communication skills are something people can work on. Q: Can the lessons of neuroscience be helpful in the hiring process? A: Neuroscience can have a huge impact on businesses, by helping leaders get better, more precise ideas of who people are. Some of the standard ways people are assessed are things like IQ tests or personality tests. But neuroscience can help you change the questions you might ask. For instance, if you're trying to identify if a candidate is good at thinking outside the box, you can present different scenarios in a gamified way. That way you can avoid putting people in positions that are not right for them. Q: How can insight from this brain research help us make better decisions? A: There are certain rules our brains live by, and we can't really change them, so we need to learn how to live with them. For example, our brains don't tend to make good decisions when there are too many options in front of us. So simplifying choices and limiting options can be a useful strategy for making better decisions. Also, understand the tradeoff between speed and accuracy, and figure out which is the most important. There are some situations that are urgent, where you have to make a quick decision. But otherwise, slowing down can be critical, because that will allow you to avoid many regrettable mistakes. Q: Are you optimistic that our brains are going to be able to handle this stressful period? A: I was writing this book last year as the pandemic was unfolding. For the most part, people have done pretty well, and we should give ourselves a pat on the back for making it this far. It's still challenging right now, and we can't let down our guards. But optimism is the key for moving forward, and having the motivation to power through. People should know that we are going to lick this thing.

science,'Road to space': billionaire Bezos has successful suborbital jaunt," VAN HORN, Texas, July 20 (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, soared some 66.5 miles (107 km) above the Texas desert aboard his company Blue Origin's ""Best day ever,"" Bezos, accompanied by three crewmates including the world's oldest and youngest space travelers, said after his capsule descended with three large parachutes and touched down, kicking up a cloud of dust. The 57-year-old American billionaire, donning a blue flight suit and cowboy hat, took a trip to the edge of space lasting 10 minutes and 10 seconds. After landing, Bezos and his crewmates exchanged hugs and popped champagne while roughly two dozen family members and company employees cheered. ""Astronaut Bezos in my seat - happy, happy, happy,"" Bezos told mission control during a safety check after the passengers buckled back in following a few minutes of weightlessness in space. The fully autonomous 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) gleaming white spacecraft, with a feather design on its side, ignited its BE-3 engine for a vertical liftoff from Blue Origin's Launch Site One facility about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural town of Van Horn under mostly clear skies. Bezos, founder of ecommerce company Amazon.com Inc ""I want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all of this,"" Bezos told reporters afterward. The flight came nine days after Briton Richard Branson was aboard his competing space tourism venture Virgin Galactic's Bezos, who founded Blue Origin in 2000, said this first crewed space flight was a step toward developing a fleet of reusable spacecraft. ""We're going to build a road to space so that our kids and their kids can build a future,"" Bezos added. ""... We need to do that to solve the problems here on Earth."" Blue Origin plans for two more New Shepard passenger flights this year. Bezos said Blue Origin has not determined its pace of flights after that but is approaching $100 million in private sales. ""The demand is very, very high,"" Bezos said, adding: ""Big things start small."" Bezos said his company is working ""ferociously"" toward being able to reuse New Shepard vehicles at least 100 times. The one used on Tuesday, twice previously flown to space, scored a bulls-eye landing on a nearby pad. BACK FLIPS AND SKITTLES New Shepard hurtled at speeds reaching 2,233 miles (3,595 km) per hour, exceeding the ""Kármán line"" - 62 miles (100 km) - set by an international aeronautics body to define the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space. After the capsule separated from the booster, the crew unbuckled, performing back flips and tossing each other Skittles candy in weightlessness. The capsule then returned to Earth with parachutes, using a retro-thrust system expelling a ""pillow of air"" for a soft landing. The launch represented another step in the fierce competition to forge a space tourism sector. In this ""billionaire space race,"" Branson pierced Earth's atmosphere first, reaching an altitude of 53 miles (86 km) aboard his rocket-powered, pilot-flown spaceplane. Bezos flew higher in what experts called the Another billionaire tech mogul, Elon Musk, plans to send an all-civilian crew on a several-day orbital mission on his Crew Dragon capsule in September.

science,China unveils 600 kph maglev train - state media," BEIJING, July 20 (Reuters) - China unveiled a maglev train capable of a top speed of 600 kph on Tuesday, state media said. The maximum speed would make the train, self-developed by China and manufactured in the coastal city of Qingdao, the fastest ground vehicle globally. Using electro-magnetic force, the maglev train ""levitates"" above the track with no contact between body and rail. China has been using the technology for almost two decades on a very limited scale. Shanghai has a short maglev line running from one of its airports to town. While there are no inter-city or inter-province maglev lines yet in China that could make good use of the higher speeds, some cities including Shanghai and Chengdu have started to conduct research. At 600 kph, it would only take 2.5 hours to travel from Beijing to Shanghai by train - a journey of more than 1,000 km (620 miles). By comparison, the journey would take 3 hours by plane and 5.5 hours by high-speed rail. Countries from Japan to Germany are also looking to build maglev networks, although high costs and incompatibility with current track infrastructure remain hurdles to rapid development.

science,"Moon 'wobble,' climate change seen as driving coastal flooding in 2030s"," July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. coastlines will face increasing flooding in the mid-2030s thanks to a regular lunar cycle that will magnify rising sea levels caused by climate change, according to research led by NASA scientists. A key factor identified by the scientists is a regular ""wobble"" in the moon's orbit - first identified in the 18th century - that takes 18.6 years to complete. The moon's gravitational pull helps drive Earth's tides. In half of this lunar cycle, Earth's regular daily tides are diminished, with high tides lower than usual and low tides higher than usual. In the cycle's other half, the situation is reversed, with high tides higher and low tides lower. The expected flooding will result from the combination of the continuing sea level rise associated with climate change and the arrival of an amplification part of the lunar cycle in the mid-2030s, the researchers said. ""In the background, we have long-term sea level rise associated with global warming. It's causing sea level to increase everywhere,"" Ben Hamlington, NASA team leader and one of the study's authors, told Reuters. ""This effect from the moon causes the tides to vary, so what we found is that this effect lines up with the underlying sea level rise, and that will cause flooding specifically in that time period from 2030 to 2040,"" Hamlington said. The researchers studied 89 tide gauge locations in every coastal U.S. state and territory aside from Alaska. The effect of the dynamic applies to the entire planet except for far northern coastlines like in Alaska. The prediction pushes previous estimates for serious coastal flooding forward by about 70 years. The study, published this month in the journal Nature Climate Change, was led by members of a NASA science team that tracks sea level change. The study focused on U.S. coasts but the findings are applicable to coasts worldwide, NASA said. ""This is eye-opening for a lot of people,"" Hamlington said. ""It's really critical information for planners. And I think there's a great amount of interest in trying to get this information from science and scientists into the hands of planners."" Hamlington said city planners should plan accordingly. ""A building or particular piece of infrastructure, you may want to be there for a very long amount of time, whereas something else you may just want to protect or have access to for a few years.""

science,'Not really nervous': Billionaire Bezos girds for inaugural space flight," July 19 (Reuters) - American billionaire businessman Jeff Bezos said on Monday he is excited and curious but not very nervous on the eve of taking part in his company Blue Origin's inaugural suborbital flight alongside the oldest and youngest people ever bound for space. The world's richest person and three crewmates are due to fly from a desert site in West Texas on an 11-minute trip to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard, a 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo. The flight represents an important milestone in the establishment of the space tourism industry. Bezos did a round of televised interviews ahead of the launch, set for around 8 a.m. CDT (1300 GMT) from Blue Origin's Launch Site One facility some 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural Texas town of Van Horn. ""People keep asking if I'm nervous. I'm not really nervous, I'm excited. I'm curious. I want to know what we're going to learn,"" Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc ""We've been training. This vehicle is ready. This crew is ready. This team is amazing,"" Bezos said. ""We just feel really good about it."" Bezos and his brother Mark Bezos will be joined in the all-civilian crew by 82-year-old pioneering female aviator Wally Funk and 18-year-old Daemen is the company's first paying customer. His father heads investment management firm Somerset Capital Partners. The flight comes nine days after rival Richard Branson, the British billionaire businessman, Bezos sought to downplay any rivalry with Branson. ""There's one person who was the first person in space. His name was Yuri Gagarin. And that happened a long time ago,"" Bezos said on the NBC's program ""Today,"" referring to the Soviet cosmonaut who reached space in 1961. ""I think I'm going to be number 570 or something. That's where we're going to be in this list. So this isn't a competition. This is about building a road to space so that future generations can do incredible things in space,"" Bezos said. Funk was one of the so-called Mercury 13 group of women who trained to become astronauts for the first U.S. human spaceflight program in the early 1960s. She passed the same rigorous testing as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in NASA's space program, though the women were denied the chance to become astronauts because of their gender. ""Back when Wally was part of the Mercury 13, all the testing that she did, she outperformed all of the men,"" Bezos said on ""Today.""

science,Blue Origin sees clear skies for inaugural space flight by Bezos and crewmates," July 18 (Reuters) - Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos and his three crewmates are engaging in a crash course of training on Sunday in preparation for his company Blue Origin's inaugural flight to the edge of space planned for Tuesday. The suborbital launch from a site in the high desert plains of West Texas marks a crucial test for Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft, a 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that is central to plans by Bezos to tap a potentially lucrative space tourism market. The planned 11-minute trip from the company's Launch Site One facility is set to include the oldest person ever to go to space - 82-year-old trailblazing female aviator Wally Funk - and the youngest - 18-year-old physics student The mission ""We are not currently working any open issues and New Shepard is ready to fly,"" Flight Director Steve Lanius said, adding that the weather forecast appeared favorable for the scheduled liftoff at 8 a.m. CDT (1300 GMT) on Tuesday. New Shepard is due to launch nine days after rival Richard Branson's space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin's training program, according to the company, includes safety briefings, a simulation of the spaceflight, a review of the rocket and its operations, and instruction on how to float around the craft's cabin after the capsule sheds Earth's gravity. Bezos and his crewmates had started the 14-hour program on Sunday and would be ready to ""experience the flight of a lifetime"", Ariane Cornell, director of astronaut sales at Blue Origin, said. Cornell said Funk was keen to do a few somersaults during the flight. New Shepard, which cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft, is named for Alan Shepard, who in 1961 became the first American in space during a suborbital flight as part of NASA's pioneering Mercury program. New Shepard, like Virgin Galactic's flight, will not enter into orbit around Earth but will take the crew some 62 miles up (100 km) before the capsule returns by parachute. Virgin Galactic's flight reached 53 miles (86 km) above Earth. Billionaire businessman Elon Musk's space transportation company, SpaceX, is pledging to go even higher in September, sending an all-civilian crew for a several-day orbital flight aboard its Crew Dragon capsule. Illustrating tensions in the high-stakes ""billionaire space race,"" Blue Origin has described Virgin Galactic as falling short of the 62-mile-high-mark (100 km) - called the Kármán line - set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space. The U.S. space agency NASA and the U.S. Air Force both define an astronaut as anyone who has flown higher than 50 miles (80 km), as Branson achieved with his flight. Blue Origin's next flight would likely be at the end of September or early October, said Chief Executive Officer Bob Smith. Smith said the ""willingness to pay continues to be quite high"" for people interested in future flights. Our Standards: Southwest Airlines said it expects ""more normal"" operations on Tuesday after it canceled more than 2,200 flights since Saturday."
science,Chinese spacecraft returns to Earth after inaugural flight," BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - A Chinese spacecraft capable of flying to the edge of the atmosphere took off and returned to Earth on the same day in what China said was a big step towards developing reusable space transportation technology. The spacecraft lifted off from a launch centre in northwest China on Friday and completed its flight according to ""set procedures"", said China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), the country's main space contractor. It then landed back on Earth ""horizontally"", CASC said in a statement. A spacecraft that can fly to suborbital space ought to be able to travel to as high as 100 km (62 miles) above the Earth's surface. The CASC did not say how high the spacecraft flew, or elaborate on its flight path. Visuals of the spacecraft or its flight were not provided. ""The development of reusable space transportation technology is an important symbol of China's transition from a 'big' space-faring nation to a 'powerful' space-faring one,"" CASC said. Reusable spacecraft would lead to higher frequency of missions and lower mission costs due to its reusability. In September last year, China sent an experimental spacecraft into orbital space on a rocket. The spacecraft returned to Earth after two days in orbit on its low-key mission. Commentators on Chinese social media have speculated that Beijing has been developing a spacecraft like the U.S. Air Force's X-37B, an autonomous spaceplane that can remain in orbit for long periods of time before flying back to Earth on its own. It is not known if both the orbital and suborbital spacecraft launched by China had fixed wings like the U.S. Space Shuttle. Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,U.S. warns SpaceX its new Texas launch site tower not yet approved," WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned Elon Musk's space company SpaceX that its environmental review of a new tower at its Boca Chica launch site in Texas is incomplete and the agency could order SpaceX to take down the tower. An FAA spokesman said on Wednesday that the agency's environmental review underway of SpaceX?�s proposed rocket assembly ""integration tower"" is ""underway,"" and added that ""the company is building the tower at its own risk."" A May 6 letter from the FAA to SpaceX seen by Reuters said recent construction activity on one of the two proposed towers ""may complicate the ongoing environmental review process for the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program."" The FAA letter said the tower could be as high as 480 feet. Based on the environmental review, the FAA could order SpaceX to take down the tower. ""It is possible that changes would have to be made at the launch site, including to the integration towers to mitigate significant impacts,"" the May 6 letter said, adding the FAA learned of the tower's construction ""based on publicly available video footage."" SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment but Musk has repeatedly criticized the FAA and the U.S. regulatory system. SpaceX told the FAA in May that it did not believe the review was necessary because it only intends to use the ""integration tower for production, research, and development purposes and not for FAA-licensed or -permitted launches,"" the FAA said. But the agency said description in documents ""indicates otherwise."" The FAA cited a SpaceX document that the towers would be used to integrate the Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle. ""Super Heavy would be mated to the launch mount, followed by Starship mated to Super Heavy,"" the FAA letter said quoting SpaceX's May 5 submission. The FAA and Musk have clashed on several occasions. On June 29, Musk lamented the delay of the launch of Transporter-2 mission in Florida. He tweeted ""an aircraft entered the ?�keep out zone?? which is unreasonably gigantic. There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform."" Earlier this year, the FAA said SpaceX's December launch of Starship SN8 violated its license requirements. Effective March 12, the FAA began requiring an agency safety inspector at all SpaceX launches to ""ensure compliance with federal regulations to protect public safety."" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson spoke with Musk on March 12 for 30 minutes to stress ""the FAA?�s role in protecting public safety by ensuring regulatory compliance. He made it clear that the FAA expected SpaceX to develop and foster a robust safety culture that stresses adherence to FAA rules,"" the agency said in April. Our Standards: Southwest Airlines said it expects ""more normal"" operations on Tuesday after it canceled more than 2,200 flights since Saturday."
science,Scientists stunned by rare Arctic lightning storms north of Alaska," ANCHORAGE, Alaska, July 16 (Reuters) - Meteorologists were stunned this week when three successive thunderstorms swept across the icy Arctic from Siberia to north of Alaska, unleashing lightning bolts in an unusual phenomenon that scientists say will become less rare with global warming. ?�Forecasters hadn?�t seen anything like that before,??said Ed Plumb, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Fairbanks, speaking about the storms that started on Saturday. Typically, the air over the Arctic Ocean, especially when the water is covered with ice, lacks the convective heat needed to generate lightning storms. But as climate change warms the Arctic faster than the rest of the world, that's changing, scientists say. Episodes of summer lightning within the Arctic Circle have tripled since 2010, a trend directly tied to climate change and increasing loss of sea ice in the far north, scientists reported in a March study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. As sea ice vanishes, more water is able to evaporate, adding moisture to the warming atmosphere. ?�It?�s going to go with the temperatures,??said co-author Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. These electrical storms threaten boreal forests fringing the Arctic, as they spark fires in remote regions already baking under the round-the-clock summer sun. Boreal Siberia in Russia gets more lightning than any other Arctic region, Holzworth said. The paper also documented more frequent lightning over the Arctic?�s treeless tundra regions, as well as above the Arctic Ocean and pack ice. In August 2019, lightning even struck within 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the North Pole, the researchers found. In Alaska alone, thunderstorm activity is on track to increase three-fold by the end of the century if current climate trends continue, according to two studies by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, published over the last year in the journal Climate Dynamics. ?�What used to be very rare is now just rare,??said Rick Thoman, a climate scientist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As the parade of Arctic storms this week demonstrated, lightning is already appearing in unexpected places, he said. ?�I have no memory of three consecutive days of this kind of thing??in the Arctic. With the sharp uptick in lightning, Siberia has seen increasingly ferocious forest fires in recent years. This week, the Russian army deployed water-dropping aircraft to douse  flames burning some nearly 2 million acres (800,000 hectares) of forest, while the hardest-hit region of Yakutia has been in a state of emergency for weeks. Meanwhile, mid-June lightning sparked one of the biggest fires this summer in Alaska, scorching more than 18,000 acres of tundra about 125 miles (200 km) north of the Arctic Circle in the Noatak National Preserve in the northwestern corner of the state. Warming in the Arctic is also encouraging the growth of vegetation on northern Alaska's tundra, adding further fuel for fires, scientists said. By the end of the century, twice as much Alaska tundra could burn on a regular basis than was the norm in the past, with fires occurring four times more frequently, according to researchers at the International Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks. On the water, the lightning is an increasing hazard to mariners, and vessel traffic is increasing as sea ice retreats, Holzworth said. People can become lightning rods and usually try to get low for safety. That's tough to do on flat tundra or ocean expanse. ?�What you really need is to pay better attention to the lightning forecasts,??he said. Our Standards: An unprecedented election pledge by Japan's ruling party to double defence spending underscores the nation's haste to acquire missiles, stealth fighters, drones and other weapons to deter China's military in the disputed East China Sea."
science,"Over 10,000 species risk extinction in Amazon, says landmark report"," SAO PAULO/BOGOTA, July 14 (Reuters) - More than 10,000 species of plants and animals are at high risk of extinction due to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest - 35% of which has already been deforested or degraded, according to the draft of a landmark scientific report published on Wednesday. Produced by the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA), the 33-chapter report brings together research on the world's largest rainforest from 200 scientists from across the globe. It is the most detailed assessment of the state of the forest to date and both makes clear the vital role the Amazon plays in global climate and the profound risks it is facing. Cutting deforestation and forest degradation to zero in less than a decade ""is critical,"" the report said, also calling for massive restoration of already destroyed areas. The rainforest is a vital bulwark against climate change both for the carbon it absorbs and what it stores. According to the report, the soil and vegetation of the Amazon hold about 200 billion tonnes of carbon, more than five times the whole world's annual CO2 emissions. Furthermore the continued destruction caused by human interference in the Amazon puts more than 8,000 endemic plants and 2,300 animals at high risk of extinction, the report added. Science shows humans face potentially irreversible and catastrophic risks due to multiple crises, including climate change and biodiversity decline, said University of Brasilia professor Mercedes Bustamante during a virtual panel discussion. ""There is a narrow window of opportunity to change this trajectory,"" Bustamante said. ""The fate of Amazon is central to the solution to the global crises."" In Brazil, deforestation has surged since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019, reaching a 12-year high last year and drawing international outcry from foreign governments and the public. Bolsonaro has called for mining and agriculture in protected areas of the Amazon and has weakened environmental enforcement agencies, which environmentalists and scientists say has directly resulted in the rising destruction. Neighboring Colombia a week ago reported that deforestation rose 8% in 2020 versus the previous year to 171,685 hectares (424,000 acres), with nearly 64% of the destruction taking place in the country's Amazon region. During the panel, former President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos lamented a lack of political will from among the Amazon countries to tackle issues facing the rainforest. ""Unfortunately right now in Latin America and especially in these eight countries ... you don't see that political leadership, you don't see any of those presidents taking the baton,"" he said, referring to the countries that border the rainforest. Of its original size, 18% of the Amazon basin has already been deforested, according to the report - mostly for agriculture and illegal timber. Another 17% has been degraded. While restoration efforts will play an important role in safeguarding the Amazon, the difficulty of restoring forests means the main goal should be protecting existing vegetation and water bodies. ""Restoration actions can be costly and complex to implement, so it's actually better to avoid deforestation and degradation so that we don't need to take restorative actions,"" said Marielos Pena-Claros, a professor at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. The continuing destruction may threaten the very ability of the rainforest to function as a carbon sink, with potentially devastating results for the global climate change. A separate study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday showed that some parts of the Amazon are emitting more carbon than they absorb, based on measurements of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide taken from above the rainforest between 2010 and 2018. Lead author Luciana Gatti, a scientist at Brazil's Inpe space research agency, suggests the increased carbon emissions in southeastern Amazonia - where deforestation is fierce - is not only the result of fires and direct destruction, but also due to rising tree mortality as severe drought and higher temperatures become more common. Our Standards: China said representatives from more than 100 countries have adopted the ""Kunming Declaration"" which calls for ""urgent and integrated action"" in creating a new global biodiversity pact."
science,Teenager to fly with Bezos in inaugural space tourism flight," July 15 (Reuters) - An 18-year-old physics student whose father heads an investment management firm is set to take the place of a person who put up $28 million in an auction to take part in the inaugural space tourism flight for billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company. Blue Origin said on Thursday Oliver Daemen will join the four-member all-civilian crew for Tuesday's scheduled flight after the auction winner, whose name had not been made public, dropped out due to unspecified ""scheduling conflicts."" Daemen becomes the company's first paying customer. His addition means that the flight is set to include the oldest person ever to go to space - 82-year-old trailblazing female aviator Wally Funk - and the youngest, Daemen, according to Blue Origin. Joining them for Blue Origin's suborbital launch will be Bezos and his brother Mark Bezos. Daemen is working to obtain his pilot's license and is set to attend the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands to study physics and innovation management in September, Blue Origin said. His father is Somerset Capital Partners CEO and founder Joes Daemen. The elder Daemen ""paid for the seat and chose to fly Oliver,"" Blue Origin said. The company declined to say how much was paid. ""Flying on New Shepard will fulfill a lifelong dream for Oliver, who has been fascinated by space, the Moon, and rockets since he was four,"" the company said in a news release. Bezos has been locked in a race with billionaire rivals Richard Branson and Elon Musk as they seek to usher in a new era of commercial space travel in a tourism market that Swiss bank UBS estimates could be worth $3 billion annually in a decade. New Shepard is a 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft. The launch is set for a site in West Texas. Branson, the British billionaire businessman, was aboard his company Virgin Galactic's rocket plane for its pioneering suborbital flight from New Mexico on Sunday.

science,Bezos' Blue Origin to make history with unpiloted civilian space flight," SEATTLE, July 14 (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos may have been beaten to space by rival Richard Branson, but the billionaire American businessman is poised to make history next week aboard what would be the world's first unpiloted suborbital flight with an all-civilian crew. Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon.com Inc He is set to be joined by his brother and private equity executive Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian woman aviator Wally Funk and an as-yet-unidentified person who paid $28 million for a spot aboard the spacecraft, scheduled to launch from a West Texas site. New Shepard is a 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft. The crew is set to include only civilians and none of Blue Origin's employees or staff astronauts, three people familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Blue Origin's astronauts include NASA space shuttle veteran Nicholas Patrick. ""To see the Earth from space, it changes you, it changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity,"" Bezos said in a video last month discussing the flight. There has never before been a fully autonomous suborbital or orbital flight with an all-civilian crew, Teal Group space industry analyst Marco Caceres said. Branson, the British billionaire businessman, was aboard his company Virgin Galactic's rocket plane for its pioneering suborbital flight from New Mexico on Sunday. The Virgin Galactic flight included two pilots, as well as the company's chief astronaut instructor and its lead operations engineer. New Shepard lifts off from a standing position on a launch pad, like traditional rocket launches. With Virgin Galactic, a rocket-powered spaceplane was dropped from a carrier plane in mid-air. New Shepard, like Virgin Galactic's flight, will not enter into orbit around Earth, but will take the passengers some 62 miles up (100 km) before the capsule returns by parachute. Virgin Galactic's flight reached 53 miles (86 km) above Earth. Billionaire businessman Elon Musk's space transportation company SpaceX is planning an even-more-ambitious mission in September, sending an all-civilian crew for a several-day orbital flight aboard its Crew Dragon capsule. 'SIMPLE MATH' Blue Origin's flight is two decades in the making. Bezos founded the company in 2000. A pilotless craft was a financial strategy adopted by Blue Origin executives years ago. ""It's simple math,"" said one of the people familiar with the company's thinking. ""If you design a system so that you don't need a pilot or a co-pilot you can have more paying customers."" New Shepard can accommodate six people. Blue Origin and industry insiders had previously discussed company employees going up on the first flight. A Blue Origin spokesperson confirmed the decision was made for four seats to offer an enhanced customer experience for the first flight. The decision to skip over Blue Origin's staff astronauts and technical experts has caused frustration for some company insiders who viewed the first crewed flight as a crucial opportunity to gather data and technical feedback for a program in its infancy, and to evaluate the experience for future paying customers, the sources said. A seasoned astronaut would provide a calming presence for civilian crew members as New Shepard blasts off at speeds upwards of 2,200 miles (3,540 km) per hour, the sources added. The crew members will receive two days of training. Blue Origin has assigned two staff members, on the ground, to help the passengers strap in and to provide point-by-point instructions over headsets during the mission. ""It's kind of like getting on a ride at an amusement park,"" Caceres said. ""You just trust that everything has been checked out, is in good working order ... and you just sit back and enjoy the ride."" Some industry sources have expressed concerns that passengers - overwhelmed by the experience or in a state of euphoria - could be rattled by routine noises, miss key instructions, pass out or injure themselves floating around the cabin, potentially dangerous scenarios a trained astronaut could respond to. Funk, 82, was one of 13 women who passed the same rigorous testing as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in NASA's 1960s space program but were denied the chance to become astronauts because of their gender. Proving the safety of space travel is important to developing what Swiss investment bank UBS estimates will be a $3 billion annual tourism market a decade from now. ""One of the main goals of the New Shepard mission is to demonstrate that going to suborbital space is perfectly safe for the average person,"" Caceres said. ""So there is a benefit to having as many average people on these flights as possible."" Our Standards: Southwest Airlines said it expects ""more normal"" operations on Tuesday after it canceled more than 2,200 flights since Saturday."
science,Billionaire Branson soars to space aboard Virgin Galactic flight," TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M., July 11 (Reuters) - British billionaire Richard Branson on Sunday soared more than 50 miles above the New Mexico desert aboard his Virgin Galactic rocket plane and safely returned in the vehicle's first fully crewed test flight to space, a symbolic milestone for a venture he started 17 years ago. Branson, one of six Virgin Galactic Holding Inc ""We?�re here to make space more accessible to all,"" an exuberant Branson, 70, said shortly after embracing his grandchildren following the flight. ""Welcome to the dawn of a new space age."" The success of the flight also gave the flamboyant entrepreneur bragging rights in a highly publicized rivalry with fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, the Amazon ""Congratulations on the flight,"" Bezos said on Instagram. ""Can?�t wait to join the club!"" Space industry executives, future customers and other well-wishers were on hand for a festive gathering to witness the launch, which was livestreamed in a presentation hosted by late-night television comedian Stephen Colbert. Joining the reception was another billionaire space industry pioneer, Elon Musk, who is also founder of electric carmaker Tesla Inc Grammy-nominated R&B singer Khalid performed his forthcoming single ""New Normal"" after the flight. The gleaming white spaceplane was carried aloft attached to the underside of the dual-fuselage jet VMS Eve (named for Branson's late mother) from Spaceport America, a state-owned facility near the aptly named town of Truth or Consequences. Virgin Galactic leases a large section of the facility. Reaching its high-altitude launch point at about 46,000 feet (14,020 m), the VSS Unity passenger rocket plane was released from the mothership and fell away as the crew ignited its rocket, sending it streaking straight upward at supersonic speed to the blackness of space some 53 miles (86 km) high. The spaceplane's contrail was clearly visible from the ground as it soared through the upper atmosphere, to the cheers of the crowd below. At the apex of the climb with the rocket shut down, the crew then experienced a few minutes of microgravity, before the spaceplane shifted into re-entry mode, and began a gliding descent to a runway back at the spaceport. The entire flight lasted about an hour. ""I was once a child with a dream looking up to the stars. Now I'm an adult in a spaceship looking down to our beautiful Earth,"" Branson said in a video from space. Back at a celebration with supporters from a stage outside Virgin Galactic's Gateway to Space complex at the spaceport, he and crewmates doused one another with champagne. Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield pinned Virgin-produced astronaut wings onto the blue flight suits worn by Branson and his team. Official wing pins from the Federal Aviation Administration will be presented later, a company spokesman said. HIGH-COST TICKETS Virgin Galactic has said it plans at least two further test flights of the spaceplane in the months ahead before beginning regular commercial operation in 2022. One of those flights will carry four Italian astronauts-in-training, according to company CEO Michael Colglazier. He said 600 wealthy would-be citizen astronauts have also booked reservations, priced at about $250,000 per ticket for the exhilaration of supersonic flight, weightlessness and the spectacle of spaceflight. Branson has said he aims ultimately to lower the price to about $40,000 per seat as the company ramps up service, achieving greater economies of scale. Colglazier said he envisions eventually building a large enough fleet to accommodate roughly 400 flights annually at the spaceport. The Swiss-based investment bank UBS has estimated the potential value of the space tourism market reaching $3 billion annually by 2030. Proving rocket travel safe for the public is key. An earlier prototype of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane crashed during a test flight over California's Mojave Desert in 2014, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another. SPACE RACE Branson's participation in Sunday's flight, announced just over a week ago, typified his persona as the daredevil executive whose various Virgin brands - from airlines to music companies - have long been associated with his ocean-crossing exploits in sailboats and hot-air balloons. His ride-along also upstaged rival astro-tourism venture Blue Origin and its founder, Bezos, in what has been popularized as the ""billionaire space race."" Bezos has been planning to fly aboard his own suborbital rocketship, the New Shepard, later this month. Branson has insisted he and Bezos are friendly rivals and were not racing to beat one another into space. ""We wish Jeff the absolute best and that he will get up and enjoy his flight,"" Branson said at a post-flight news conference. Blue Origin, however, has disparaged Virgin Galactic as falling short of a true spaceflight experience, saying that unlike Unity, Bezos's New Shepard tops the 62-mile-high-mark (100 km), called the Kármán line, set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space. ""New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name,"" Blue Origin said in a series of Twitter posts on Friday. However, U.S. space agency NASA and the U.S. Air Force both define an astronaut as anyone who has flown higher than 50 miles (80 km). A third player in the space tourism sector, Musk's SpaceX, plans to send its first all-civilian crew (without Musk) into orbit in September, after having already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. A Virgin Galactic spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that Musk had bought a ticket for his own space ride. The newspaper said that it was not clear how far up the waiting list Musk is for a seat. Representatives for Musk could not be immediately reached. Virgin Galactic and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The spaceplane's two pilots were Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci. The three other mission specialists were Beth Moses, the company's chief astronaut instructor; Virgin Galactic's lead operations engineer Colin Bennett; and Sirisha Bandla, a research operations and government affairs vice president. All recounted afterward being mesmerized by the view through Unity's windows. Mackay described the immense blackness of space against the brightness of Earth's surface, ""separated by the beautiful blue atmosphere, which is very complex and very thin."" ""Cameras don?�t do it justice,"" he told reporters. ""You have to see it with your own eyes."" Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,U.S. approves Blue Origin license for human space travel ahead of Bezos flight," SEATTLE/WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it approved a Blue Origin license to carry humans on the New Shepard launch system into space. Former Amazon.com Blue Origin is authorized to carry humans while its FAA license is valid through August and is approved to conduct these missions from its Launch Site One facility in Texas, the agency confirmed. Blue Origin was required to verify its launch vehicle's hardware and software worked safely during a test flight and the FAA confirmed it met regulatory requirements. Blue Origin's flight will come a little over a week after space-tourism rival Virgin Galactic successfully sent a crew including its founder, British billionaire Richard Branson, to the edge of space. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, as well as the space firm founded by rival billionaire Elon Musk, are working to usher in a new era of routine commercial civilian space travel in what has been popularized as the ""billionaire space race.""

science,Israeli lunar landing venture says it secures $70 million for 2024 launch," JERUSALEM, July 11 (Reuters) - An Israeli space group is on course to make its second attempt at an unmanned lunar landing in 2024 after securing $70 million in private funding for the mission. The SpaceIL organisation said on Sunday that Patrick Drahi, a Franco-Israeli billionaire and controlling shareholder of Altice Europe Israel in December said it would try another unmanned lunar landing in early 2024 after its first attempt ended in 2019 with the dishwasher-sized Beresheet (Hebrew for Genesis) craft crashing due to what engineers described as a technical failure on final approach. ""I plan to do everything that is within my power to take Israel back to the moon,"" Kahn said. The new project, named ""Beresheet 2"", will involve launching two landing craft and an orbiter that would circle the moon for years, conducting experiments and collecting data on behalf of school students. The non-profit SpaceIL said the pledged funding comprises most of the $100 million cost of the project ""and gives a high probability for meeting the 2024 launch timetable"". It said ""Beresheet 2"" planned to break several space records, including the double landing, with one of the craft setting down on the far side of the moon. Only China has carried out a far side soft landing, in 2019. The two Israeli landing craft would be the smallest ever launched into space, with each weighing 120 kilograms (264.5 pounds) with fuel and 60 kgs without fuel. During the mothership's five-year mission, it will serve as a platform for educational science activities in Israel and worldwide via a remote connection that will enable students to take part in deep-space scientific research, SpaceIL said. SpaceIL is leading the project in collaboration with the Israeli Space Agency, Ministry of Science and Technology and Israel Aircraft Industries.

science,"Factbox: Branson, Bezos and Musk - three space tourism pioneers"," July 9 (Reuters) - Three billionaire entrepreneurs - Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk - are competing to usher in a new era of commercial space tourism. Here is how their rival ventures compare in the race to open the final frontier to wealthy, would-be citizen astronauts. TICKETS Branson, Bezos and Musk have been investing billions of dollars in their space companies, each promising to ferry paying customers on rides to space - and it will cost a hefty fee to book a seat. Branson's Virgin Galactic Reuters reported in 2018 that Bezos' Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for a ride, based on an appraisal of Branson's rival plans and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed. Blue has not divulged its long-term pricing structure. An as-yet unidentified person secured one of the seats on Blue's first suborbital mission, slated for July 20, with a $28 million auction bid. That passenger will be joined by Bezos, his brother, Mark, and Wally Funk, one of 13 women who passed NASA's astronaut training program in the 1960s and will now become the oldest person to travel in space, at age 82. Musk's SpaceX has already sent astronauts and cargo payloads to the International Space Station, and the company has plans to launch an all-civilian crew into orbit in September. Musk has also said SpaceX will fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with its forthcoming Starship rocket in 2023. DESIGN Virgin Galactic's reusable SpaceShipTwo system will see its VSS Unity spaceplane hoisted by a large, twin-fuselage carrier jet to 50,000 feet (15,250 m), before it separates and rockets straight up through the top of the atmosphere, about 55 miles (88 km) high. The spaceplane then glides back to land on a runway. Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo blasts off directly into suborbital space before separating. The rocket section flies itself back to the launchpad, while the pressurized capsule falls back to Earth under parachutes. It features six observation windows - the most ever in a space vehicle. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule sits atop a reusable Falcon 9 rocket, which it uses to reach orbit. CREW AND PASSENGERS Virgin Galactic's spaceplane can hold six people: two crew and four passengers. Blue Origin's craft can take six passengers and flies autonomously. The SpaceX Dragon capsule is capable of carrying up to seven people. ITINERARY Virgin Galactic boasts a total flight time of around 90 minutes from take-off to landing, including about 4 minutes of microgravity. Blue Origin's capsule suborbital flight is around 10 minutes after separation. Again, those on board experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before returning to Earth. The SpaceX missions are expected to last three to four days from launch to splashdown. FUNDING Typical of Branson's ventures, Virgin Galactic is publicly funded. Its shares peaked at almost $60 following FAA approval of passenger travel in June 2021. Blue Origin is privately owned, with Amazon.com Inc SpaceX is also privately owned and has raised billions of dollars in successive funding rounds. Key investors include Alphabet and Fidelity.

science,"Benefits of mRNA COVID vaccines outweigh rare heart risks, says WHO"," GENEVA, July 9 (Reuters) - The benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the very small risk they might cause heart inflammation, as the jabs reduce hospitalisations and deaths, an advisory panel of the World Health Organization said on Friday. In a statement, the WHO said that reports of two rare conditions - myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, and of its lining, called pericarditis - had typically occurred within days of vaccination, mainly among younger males after the second dose. ""Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,"" it said, referring to the two vaccines using such technology, by Pfizer-BioNTech ""The benefits of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the risks in reducing hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 infections,"" it said. Available data suggested myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination was ""generally mild"" and responded to treatment such as rest or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the WHO said. ""Follow-up is ongoing to determine long-term outcomes,"" it said. ""Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination,"" it added. Earlier on Friday, Europe's drug regulator said it had found a possible link between very rare heart inflammation and COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

science,Chinese researchers propose deflecting 'Armageddon' asteroids with rockets," BEIJING, July 7 (Reuters) - Chinese researchers want to send more than 20 of China's largest rockets to practice turning away a sizable asteroid - a technique that may eventually be crucial if a killer rock is on a collision course with Earth. The idea is more than science fiction. Sometime between late 2021 to early 2022, the United States will launch a robotic spacecraft to intercept two asteroids relatively close to Earth. When it arrives a year later, the NASA spacecraft will crash-land on the smaller of the two rocky bodies to see how much the asteroid's trajectory changes. It will be humanity's first try at changing the course of a celestial body. At China's National Space Science Center, researchers found in simulations that 23 Long March 5 rockets hitting simultaneously could deflect a large asteroid from its original path by a distance 1.4 times the Earth's radius. Their calculations are based on an asteroid dubbed Bennu, orbiting the sun, which is as wide as the Empire State Building is tall. It belongs to a class of rocks with the potential to cause regional or continental damage. Asteroids spanning more than 1 km would have global consequences. The science center cited a recently published study in Icarus, a journal on planetary science. Long March 5 rockets are key to China's near-term space ambitions - from delivering space station modules to launching probes to the Moon and Mars. China has successfully launched six Long March 5 rockets since 2016, with the last one causing some safety concerns as ""The proposal of keeping the upper stage of the launch rocket to a guiding spacecraft, making one large 'kinetic impactor' to deflect an asteroid, is a rather nice concept,"" said Professor Alan Fitzsimmons from the Astrophysics Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast. ""By increasing the mass hitting the asteroid, simple physics should ensure a much greater effect,"" Fitzsimmons told Reuters, although, he added, the actual operation of such a mission needs to be studied in greater detail. Current estimates show there is roughly a 1% chance a 100-metre-wide asteroid would strike Earth in the next 100 years, said Professor Gareth Collins at Imperial College London. ""Something the size of Bennu colliding is about 10 times less likely,"" Collins said. Altering an asteroid's path presents a lower risk than blasting the rock with nuclear explosives, which may create smaller fragments without changing their course, scientists say.

science,Vaccines may curb new virus mutations; teens use soft drinks to fake positive COVID-19 tests," July 7 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. COVID-19 vaccines may be curbing new virus mutations Along with preventing illness and deaths, COVID-19 vaccines may also be curbing the ""rampant evolution"" of the new coronavirus by limiting new mutations that allow it to evade antibodies, researchers believe. As part of a larger study, they closely analyzed gene sequences in virus samples obtained from 30 COVID-19 patients who had not been vaccinated and 23 vaccinated individuals with so-called breakthrough cases of COVID-19. In particular, they looked at genes associated with the spike the virus uses to break into cells. The spikes are targeted by the antibodies unleashed by current treatments and vaccines. The more the spike mutates, or changes, the less likely the antibodies will be fully effective. Compared to virus samples from unvaccinated patients, samples from vaccine breakthrough patients showed significantly fewer mutations on the spike, researchers from data analytics company nference reported on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The more people get infected, the more opportunities the virus has to mutate as it makes copies of itself inside the body. It is possible that by suppressing the number of copies made in vaccinated people, the chances to mutate are reduced as well, the authors suggest. ""This study presents the first known evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the ... escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2,"" they concluded. ( Some teens are faking positive COVID-19 tests Teenagers have figured out how to use soft drinks to fake a positive COVID-19 test, and the authors of a new study warn schools and other groups to be aware. As of July 1, videos uploaded to social media under the search term #fakecovidtest, featuring young people applying various liquids to rapid antigen COVID-19 tests, had been viewed millions of times, according to the British news website inews.co.uk. Rapid COVID-19 tests are generally reliable Used properly, ""rapid antigen"" COVID-19 tests that give fast results are generally reliable, a new study suggests. The tests have ""good"" sensitivity, or the ability to correctly identify patients who are infected with the coronavirus, and ""excellent"" specificity, or the ability to correctly identify people who are not infected, UK researchers reported in The Lancet Microbe. Unlike gold-standard PCR tests, which involve complex lab equipment and highly trained staff, rapid antigen tests can be processed on the spot. The researchers evaluated six commercially available tests. Compared to PCR, their accuracy at diagnosing infection varied from 65% to 89% and rose above 90% in patients with high viral loads. The researchers warn that correct use of the tests is essential, which may happen less often with members of the public than when administered by trained healthcare workers. Although PCR-based testing is more accurate, they conclude, the rapid tests' ""versatility in terms of cost and portability,"" and their usefulness in disrupting transmission from infected asymptomatic individuals who would otherwise go undetected ""could outweigh the risk of missing positive cases.""

science,Smart foam material gives robotic hand the ability to self-repair," SINGAPORE, July 6 (Reuters) - Singapore researchers have developed a smart foam material that allows robots to sense nearby objects, and repairs itself when damaged, just like human skin. Artificially innervated foam, or AiFoam, is a highly elastic polymer created by mixing fluoropolymer with a compound that lowers surface tension. This allows the spongy material to fuse easily into one piece when cut, according to the researchers at the National University of Singapore. ""There are many applications for such a material, especially in robotics and prosthetic devices, where robots need to be a lot more intelligent when working around humans,"" explained lead researcher Benjamin Tee. To replicate the human sense of touch, the researchers infused the material with microscopic metal particles and added tiny electrodes underneath the surface of the foam. When pressure is applied, the metal particles draw closer within the polymer matrix, changing their electrical properties. These changes can be detected by the electrodes connected to a computer, which then tells the robot what to do, Tee said. ""When I move my finger near the sensor, you can see the sensor is measuring the changes of my electrical field and responds accordingly to my touch,"" he said. This feature enables the robotic hand to detect not only the amount but also the direction of applied force, potentially making robots more intelligent and interactive. Tee said AiFoam is the first of its kind to combine both self-healing properties and proximity and pressure sensing. After spending over two years developing it, he and his team hope the material can be put to practical use within five years. ""It can also allow prosthetic users to have more intuitive use of their robotic arms when grabbing objects,"" he said.

Lack of vaccine side effects no cause for concern While a variety of side effects after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be a sign of the immune system kicking into high gear, a lack of such reactions does not mean it has failed to respond, researchers have found. They tested 206 hospital employees for antibodies against the coronavirus before and after receipt of the vaccine from Pfizer mRNA vaccines limit severity of rare breakthrough infections In the rare cases of COVID-19 that occur after vaccination, patients are likely to be sick for less time and have milder symptoms than if they were unvaccinated, according to a U.S. study of nearly 4,000 healthcare personnel, first responders, and other frontline workers. In participants who were tested weekly since mid-December, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in five who were fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine from either Pfizer and BioNTech or Moderna, 11 who were partially protected, having received either one shot or were less than 14 days out from their second, and 156 who were unvaccinated. Most unvaccinated patients were sick for at least two weeks, compared with only one week for vaccinated patients, the researchers reported on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Patients who were fully or partially vaccinated had 58% lower odds of fever and spent an average of 2.3 fewer days in bed than unvaccinated patients. Their viral loads also averaged 40% lower.

Sirisha Bandla, 33, who was born in Guntur district of India's southern Andhra Pradesh state, will be a part of billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic's test flight on July 11 that will travel beyond the edge of the earth's atmosphere. A successful flight by Branson aboard Virgin's VSS Unity spaceplane would mark a milestone in the race to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel. Branson's mission will be the 22nd flight test for VSS Unity, and the company's fourth crewed spaceflight. Bandla, who developed an early interest in space, completed her studies in the field before joining Virgin Galactic in 2015. ""I am so incredibly honored to be a part of the amazing crew of #Unity22, and to be a part of a company whose mission is to make space available to all,"" Bandla said in a tweet. Her grandfather, Dr Ragaiah, a retired scientist who goes by one name, told Reuters she had always been fascinated by space. ""From the beginning, she was very much fascinated towards the sky, looking at the sky, space, how to enter space and what is there,"" he said. ""I am very happy and overwhelmed with joy.

science,Billionaire Branson set to fly to space aboard Virgin Galactic rocket plane," July 9 (Reuters) - Decades after burnishing his reputation as a wealthy daredevil mogul in a series of boating and hot-air balloon expeditions, Richard Branson is poised to promote his burgeoning astro-tourism venture by launching himself to the final frontier. Branson's Virgin Galactic Holding Inc The gleaming white spaceplane will be borne by a twin-fuselage carrier jet dubbed VMS Eve (named for Branson's mother) to an altitude of 50,000 feet, where Unity will be released and soar by rocket power in an almost vertical climb through the outer fringe of Earth's atmosphere. At the apex of its flight some 55 miles (89 km) above the New Mexico desert, the crew will experience a few minutes of weightlessness before making a gliding descent back to Earth. If all goes according to plan, the flight will last about 90 minutes and end where it began - on a runway at Spaceport America near the aptly named town of Truth or Consequences. Virgin's Unity 22 mission marks the 22nd test flight of the spacecraft, and the company's fourth crewed mission beyond Earth's atmosphere. But it will be the first to carry a full complement of space travelers ??two pilots and four ""mission specialists,"" Branson among them. MILESTONE AND PUBLICITY Although the mission is seen as a potential milestone in helping transform citizen rocket travel into a mainstream commercial venture, spaceflight remains an inherently hazardous endeavor. An earlier prototype of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane crashed during a test flight over California's Mojave Desert in 2014, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another. If successful, Sunday's flight will also give Branson bragging rights to besting rival Jeff Bezos and his space company, Blue Origin, in what has been popularized as a ""billionaire space race."" Bezos, founder of online retail giant Amazon.com, is slated to fly aboard Blue Origin's suborbital rocketship, the New Shepard, later this month. Branson's official job on his flight is to ""evaluate the private astronaut experience,"" and his observations will be used to ""enhance the journey for all future astronaut customers,"" according to Virgin's press materials. But Marco Caceres, a senior space analyst for the Virginia-based consulting firm Teal Group, said the Branson and Bezos ride-alongs were each ""a bit of a publicity stunt."" ""If they succeed, their ventures will be taken more seriously,"" Caceres said. ""There's plenty of multimillionaires in the world that would like to go up on an adventure, so long as they see it as relatively safe."" Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, along with fellow billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX, are competing head-to-head in the emerging business of space tourism, though Musk has a big head start. In a Twitter SpaceX, which plans to send its first all-civilian crew (without Musk) into orbit in September, has already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station. Branson, 70, insists there is plenty of demand from wealthy would-be citizen astronauts to go around, and that he had no intention of trying to upstage Bezos. 'NOT A RACE' ""It's honestly not a race,"" Branson told Reuters in an interview earlier this week. ""If it's a race, it's a race to produce wonderful spaceships that can make many more people be able to access space. And I think that's both of our aims."" The spaceplane's two pilots, Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, will control the ignition and shutoff of the ship's rocket engine, and activate the vehicle's ""feathered"" tail maneuver for re-entry. The three other mission specialists are Beth Moses, the company's chief astronaut instructor; Virgin Galactic's lead operations engineer Colin Bennett; and Sirisha Bandla, a research operations and government affairs vice president. The Virgin brand, including Branson's airline and former record label, has long been associated with exploits of derring-do by its flamboyant founder. Branson set a new record for the fastest boat crossing of the Atlantic in 1986, a year after his initial attempt ended with a Royal Air Force helicopter rescue when his vessel capsized. In 1987 he made a record-breaking Atlantic crossing by hot-air balloon, though again he had to be rescued from the sea. He went on to break at least two other air-balloon speed records but failed to complete any of three bids to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. As for Sunday's flight, Branson said this week that he is excited, ""and I really don't think there?�s anything there to be scared about."" Assuming the mission goes well, Virgin has said it plans two further test flights of the spaceplane before beginning commercial service next year. The company has said it has received more than 600 flight reservations, priced at around $250,000 per ticket, but hopes eventually to slash the cost of each seat to $40,000.

science,"Science, industry team up in Italy to zap virus with laser"," ROME, July 2 (Reuters) - A United Nations-backed scientific research centre has teamed up with an Italian tech firm to explore whether laser light can be used to kill coronavirus particles suspended in the air and help keep indoor spaces safe. The joint effort between the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) of Trieste, a city in the north of Italy, and the nearby Eltech K-Laser company, was launched last year as COVID-19 was battering the country. They created a device that forces air through a sterilization chamber which contains a laser beam filter that pulverizes viruses and bacteria. ""I thought lasers were more for a shaman rather than a doctor but I have had to change my mind. The device proved able to kill the viruses in less than 50 milliseconds,"" said Serena Zacchigna, group leader for Cardiovascular Biology at the ICGEB. Healthy indoor environments with a substantially reduced pathogen count are deemed essential for public health in the post COVID-19 crisis, a respiratory infection which has caused more than four million deaths worldwide in barely 18 months. Zacchigna hooked up with Italian engineer Francesco Zanata, the founder of Eltech K-Laser, a firm specialised in medical lasers whose products are used by sports stars to treat muscle inflammation and fractures. Some experts have warned against the possible pitfalls of using light-based technologies to attack the virus that causes COVID-19. A study published by the Journal of Photochemistry & Photobiology in November 2020 highlighted concerns ranging from potential cancer risks to the cost of expensive light sources. But Zacchigna and Zanata dismissed any health issues, saying the laser never comes into contact with human skin. ""Our device uses nature against nature. It is 100% safe for people and almost fully recyclable,"" Zanata told Reuters. The technology, however, does not eliminate viruses and bacteria when they drop from the air onto surfaces or the floor. Nor can it prevent direct contagion when someone who is infected sneezes or talks loudly in the proximity of someone else. Eltech K-Laser has received a patent from Italian authorities and is seeking to extend this globally. The portable version of the invention is some 1.8 metres (5.9 ft) high and weighs about 25 kg (55 lb). The company said the technology can also be placed within air-conditioning units. In the meantime, the first potential customers are lining up, including Germany's EcoCare, a service provider of testing and vaccination solutions.

Funk, 82, will be the oldest person ever to travel into space, Blue Origin said in an announcement on Thursday. ""I didn't think I'd ever get to go up,"" Funk said in a video interview posted on the company's website. Funk, then a 21-year-old pilot, was the youngest of the 13 women who passed the same rigorous testing as the Mercury Seven male astronauts in NASA's program that first sent Americans into space between 1961 and 1963, but were denied the chance to become astronauts themselves because of their gender. She was the first female flight instructor at a U.S. military base and the first woman to become an air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board.

science,"Delta variant gains ground in U.S., men do worse with COVID-19"," June 30 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Highly contagious Delta variant gaining ground in U.S. The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in India, has become the most prevalent variant among new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to California-based genomics company Helix. The company's computer models indicate that Delta now accounts for around 40% of new U.S. cases, Dr. William Lee, vice president of science at Helix, said in a statement provided to Reuters. The models, based on 27,717 virus samples from 687 counties across the United States, also indicated that the worrisome Gamma variant, first identified in Brazil, accounts for about 15% of new cases. Helix researchers have noted occasional cases of an ""offspring"" variant of Delta called Delta-plus, but they ""aren't seeing any evidence suggesting that these are driving the growth of Delta around the country yet,"" Lee said. Earlier in June, the researchers reported on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review that the percentage of new COVID-19 cases due to the variant first identified in Britain, known as Alpha, had dropped from 70% in mid-April 2021 to 42% six weeks later ( Regardless of health status, men do worse with COVID-19 Men appear more likely than women to experience severe outcomes from COVID-19 regardless of whether the men have underlying health conditions, according to a new study. Researchers in New York City who tracked roughly 5,000 patients of both sexes who were diagnosed in early 2020 found that men were sicker when first diagnosed and had a higher need for intensive care treatment and higher rates of death than women. This was true even though the men on average were younger and less likely than women to have risk factors such as obesity and high blood pressure that previously have been linked with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Among women, the likelihood of severe COVID-19 outcomes did seem to be related to their health status, the researchers said in a report published on Wednesday in the journal Communications Medicine. A second analysis of another group of roughly 1,600 patients in New York City diagnosed later in the year showed similar patterns. The authors noted that because their information on patients' pre-existing medical problems may have been incomplete, larger studies are needed to confirm their findings and to explain the causes.

science,"'Extreme' white dwarf sets cosmic records for small size, huge mass"," WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - In their death throes, roughly 97% of all stars become a smoldering stellar zombie called a white dwarf, one of the densest objects in the cosmos. A newly discovered white dwarf is being hailed as the most ""extreme"" one of these on record, cramming a frightful amount of mass into a surprisingly small package. Scientists said on Wednesday this highly magnetized and rapidly rotating white dwarf is 35% more massive than our sun yet boasts a petite diameter only a bit larger than Earth's moon. That means it has the greatest mass and, counterintuitively, littlest size of any known white dwarf, owing to its tremendous density. Only two other types of objects - black holes and neutron stars - are more compact than white dwarfs. The way this white dwarf, named ZTF J1901+1458, was born also is unusual. It apparently is the product of a binary star system in which two stars orbit each other. These two stars separately evolved into white dwarfs at the end of their life cycles, then spiraled toward one another and merged into a single entity. With even a smidgen more combined mass, this merger would have resulted in an immense stellar explosion called a supernova, said Caltech astrophysicist Ilaria Caiazzo, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature. It still might explode at some point in the future, Caiazzo added. ""This white dwarf is really extreme,"" Caiazzo said. ""We found an object that is really at the limit of how small and heavy a white dwarf could be."" It is located relatively nearby in our Milky Way galaxy, about 130 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year - about 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The white dwarf is actually shrinking very gradually, becoming ever more dense. If it does not explode, that could lead to a core collapse transforming it into a neutron star, another type of stellar remnant about the size of a city, typically formed after certain very massive stars go supernova. This would be a previously unrecognized path to neutron star formation. The white dwarf was spotted by astrophysicist and study co-author Kevin Burdge from Caltech's Palomar Observatory. ""White dwarfs are the most common form of stellar remnant,"" said Burdge, who worked on the study at Caltech and is headed to MIT. ""So it's stunning to see the most extreme outliers among them."" Its diameter of roughly 2,670 miles (4,300 km) - approximately the distance from Boston to Los Angeles or London to Tehran - slightly exceeds the moon's diameter of about 2,160 miles (3,475 km). While our sun rotates around its axis once every 27 days, this white dwarf does so every seven minutes. Its magnetic field is about a billion times stronger than Earth's. Stars with up to eight times the mass of our sun are thought to be destined to end up as a white dwarf. Such stars eventually burn up all of the hydrogen they use as fuel through nuclear fusion. At this point, gravity causes them to collapse and blow off their outer layers in a 'red giant' stage, eventually leaving a dense core that is a white dwarf. White dwarfs initially have high temperatures but gradually cool over time, lacking any new energy source. In roughly 5 billion years, our sun is expected to become a red giant and later a white dwarf.

science,"Sick as a dog? Pets often catch COVID from humans, study finds"," AMSTERDAM, July 1 (Reuters) - If you think you have COVID-19, it might be best to stay away from your pets, says the author of a Dutch study that found a surprising number of dogs and cats may be getting infected. ""About one out of five pets will catch the disease from their owners,"" said Dr Els Broens of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, although there are no known cases of the disease spreading from pets to humans. ""Luckily, the animals do not get very ill from it."" In Broens' study, presented this week in a paper at the European Congress of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, 156 dogs and 154 cats from 196 households were tested in homes where humans were known to have had a coronavirus infection. About 17% of the animals, 31 cats and 23 dogs, had antibodies for COVID-19, suggesting they had been infected. In addition, six cats and seven dogs, or 4.2% of the animals, had an active infection as shown by a PCR test. Later testing showed those animals recovered quickly and did not pass it on to other pets in the same household, Broens said. COVID-19 is thought to originate in bats and it has been known since the first months of the pandemic that non-human mammals can be infected, but few become seriously ill. Only minks are known to have been infected by humans and then passed the disease on to other humans. Broens said the affection owners have for their cats and dogs may play a role in the pets' high infection rates. ""A lot of the pet owners are in very close contact, like they sleep with their animals in their bed, so you can imagine that there's close contact, so that transmission can take place,"" she said.

The 22-member space programme has just closed its latest decennial recruitment call for astronauts and received 22,000 applicants, Aschbacher said. ""We would like to launch an astronaut with a disability, which would be the first time ever,"" the Austrian added. ""But I'm also happy for ESA because it shows that space is for everyone, and that's something I'd like to convey."" The ESA, whose Ariane rocket once dominated the market for commercial satellite launches, faces ever stiffer competition from tech-funded upstarts like Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX. Amazon founder Bezos hopes next month to become the first man to go into space on his own rocket, highlighting the growing role tech billionaires are playing in a field that was once dominated by public agencies. ""Space is developing extremely fast and if we don't catch up with this train we are left behind,"" he added, outlining plans to refashion the agency as a more entrepreneurial player ready to work with venture capitalists to help grow European start-ups that could one day rival the Silicon Valley players. The challenges are immense: the ESA's 7 billion euro budget is a third of NASA's, while its seven or eight launches a year are dwarfed by the 40 carried out by the United States. Aschbacher, who grew up staring at the stars above his parents' mountain farm in Austria, himself once applied to become an ESA astronaut when he was a student. But what was once a geeky, niche enthusiasm has now become mainstream, he said. This year's job ad attracted almost three times the 8,000 applications received a decade ago, and a quarter of them were women, up from just 15% before. The ESA has promised to develop technologies to ensure those with disabilities, like shortened legs, play a full part. And those astronauts will go beyond the International Space Station: some will deploy to the United States's planned Gateway station on the moon, while the ESA's member states are considering an invitation from Chinese and Russian space agencies to participate in their similar moonbase project. Could European astronauts one day be serving simultaneously on two different moonbases at once? ""The invitation is on the table and it's a very nice idea,"" he said.

Pandemic tied to sharp rise in type 2 diabetes in kids Hospitalization rates for children with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes rose sharply during the pandemic, two hospitals reported at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, held virtually this year. At Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, children with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes accounted for 0.62% of inpatients from March through December 2020, up from 0.27% the year before. Those numbers are low, ""but just the fact that this rate has more than doubled over the past year is ... significant,"" said Dr. Daniel Hsia of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. Children hospitalized in 2020 had more severe diabetes, with higher blood sugar and more dehydration, than children admitted in the prior year, he said. At Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, cases of new-onset type 2 diabetes in children increased 182% from 2019 to 2020 - and the children were sicker than in previous years, a separate team reported. Most of these children at both hospitals had not previously had COVID-19. Social distancing measures may have kept children from having regular physical activity and contributed to weight gain, and also kept parents from taking them for routine medical care, all of which may have contributed to more severe illness, researchers speculated. ""Our study reinforces the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle for children even under such difficult circumstances"" Hsia said in a  statement. ( Immune cell ""factories"" work longer after mRNA vaccines The tiny ""factories"" in lymph nodes that churn out antibody-producing B cells to fight infections, called germinal centers, were still functioning to hold COVID-19 at bay for months after people received the mRNA vaccine from BioNTech  and Pfizer Following AstraZeneca with Pfizer shot boosts antibody response Giving a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine four weeks after an AstraZeneca COVID-19, not Pfizer's vaccine, tied to Bell's palsy The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has not been linked with a higher risk for the facial nerve paralysis known as Bell's palsy, but COVID-19 itself does increase the risk, suggest two separate studies published on Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. One study involved 110 people in Israel who received the Pfizer vaccine, including 37 in whom the characteristic facial droop developed on average nine days after the first dose or 14 days after the second. After accounting for underlying risk factors for Bell's palsy, the researchers concluded the vaccine itself did not increase the risk. Furthermore, they found, rates of Bell's palsy had not gone up during the vaccine rollout. In the second study, researchers compared Bell's palsy rates among roughly 348,000 patients with COVID-19 and roughly 63,500 people who had been vaccinated against the coronavirus. The Bell's palsy risk was nearly seven times higher in those with COVID-19, they found. ""Our data suggest that rates of facial nerve palsy are higher in patients who are positive for COVID-19, and this incidence exceeds the reported incidence of Bell's Palsy with the COVID-19 vaccine,"" said Dr. Akina Tamaki of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, who coauthored that study.

science,'Normalizing' UFOs - retired U.S. Navy pilot recalls Tic Tac encounter," WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - Retired U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich has found herself in the glare of media attention ahead of a highly anticipated government report on UFOs, a subject she says she has little interest in, despite actually encountering one on the job. ""I don't consider myself a whistle blower ... I don't identify as a UFO person,"" the former fighter pilot told Reuters in a Zoom interview, days before the report, expected to feature her own experience and dozens of others like it, was due for presentation to Congress. During a routine training mission with the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the Southern California coast in November 2004,  Dietrich and her then-commanding officer, fellow pilot David Fravor, were asked by another warship to investigate radar contacts in the area moving in an inexplicable fashion. She recounted they first noticed an unusual ""churning"" of the ocean surface before seeing what she and Fravor have described as a smooth, white oblong object resembling a large Tic Tac breath mint flying at high speed over the water. When Fravor in his jet turned to ""engage with"" the object, ""it appeared to respond in a way that we didn't recognize"" because it seemed to lack ""any visible flight control surfaces or means of propulsion,"" Dietrich recalled. Footage of what Dietrich and Fravor witnessed that day, now popularly known as the Tic Tac incident, will likely be included in the The U.S. Navy has previously confirmed the videos as authentic. Dietrich, now a mother of three, has discussed her experience in a recent joint appearance with Fravor on the CBS News program ""60 Minutes,"" and has since addressed dozens of video calls from other journalists asking to know more about what she saw in 2004. Her answer remains the same, as it has for the past 17 years. ""We don't know what it was, but it could have been a natural phenomenon in human activity. But the point was that it was weird, and we couldn't recognize it,"" Dietrich said, speaking from a Colorado hotel room she was sharing with her children and two dogs. Juggling media queries amid a cross-country family move is exhausting, but Dietrich said she wants to reduce the stigma attached to reporting UFO sightings and hopes more people can speak up without fear of ridicule. ""Folks might be concerned about their careers or their church or something like that. They don't want to be the kooky UFO person, so I guess I'm trying to normalize it by talking about it,"" Dietrich said. Public fascination with unidentified flying objects has been stoked in recent weeks by the forthcoming report, as UFO enthusiasts anticipate possible revelations about unexplained sightings many believe the government has sought to discredit or cover up for decades. According to preliminary details reported by The New York Times, citing senior administration officials briefed on the report, U.S. intelligence officials Senior U.S. officials cited in the Times article said the report's ambiguity meant the government was unable to definitively rule out extraterrestrial origins of the sightings. The Times said the report, to be presented by U.S. intelligence in conjunction with the Pentagon, covers more than 120 documented cases of enigmatic objects exhibiting speed and maneuverability exceeding known aviation technologies. Dietrich said she has no opinion on the report and was not privy to its contents. She would like to hear more from pilots who have had similar UFO sightings. ""There's a common humanity, I guess, of being a little bit shocked, a little bit delighted, a little bit nervous, confused, all of that. And so, recognizing that in another human, that can be comforting in a way,"" she said. But Dietrich also voiced hope that public interest in UFOs would abate as the subject gains more mainstream attention. ""I hope I'm not the UFO, Tic Tac person for the rest of my life.

Vaccine-associated myocarditis tends to resolve quickly Cases of an inflammation of the heart muscle known as myocarditis have been reported after receiving COVID-19 shots, mostly in young men after the second dose of the mRNA vaccines. When myocarditis symptoms, such as chest pain and rapid or irregular heartbeats, do occur after vaccination, they usually resolve quickly, suggests a report of a small study published in the journal Circulation. Doctors tracked seven male patients, ages 19 to 39, who were hospitalized for myocarditis-like illness not long after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by either Pfizer Delta variant's spike fuses cells to infect them Compared to the spike protein on earlier versions of the coronavirus, the spike on the worrisome Delta variant is better able to break into lung cells and fuse them together, researchers have discovered. ""Spread by cell-to-cell fusion allows the virus to spread faster in infected people and partially hide from the immune system,"" said Markus Hoffman of Georg-August-University Göttingen in Germany, coauthor of a report posted on Wednesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. ""For example, if a cell that is infected by the Delta variant is forced (by the spike protein) to fuse with a neighboring cell that is not yet infected, this allows the virus to enter the new cell much faster"" than if the virus particles first needed to be released from a previously infected cell, he explained. By spreading via cell-to-cell fusion, the virus reduces its risk of encountering immune system cells that might attack and inactivate it, Hoffman added. These ""skills"" might make the Delta variant - first identified in India and now circulating widely in many countries - more transmissible, and the resulting illness more severe, the researchers said. The researchers also found that although the Delta variant can evade antibodies, it is not completely resistant. ""It might be possible that the Delta variant can infect people who are vaccinated (especially if only one of two vaccine shots have been administered so far), but vaccination is highly effective in preventing severe disease,"" Hoffman said. ( Open Our Standards: Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that Moderna Inc had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong."
science,Bezos' 2021 Space Odyssey a risk too far for insurers," June 24 (Reuters) - Launching one of the richest individuals on earth into orbit has proved a leap too far for insurers, who are not ready to price the risk of losing Jeff Bezos or his fellow space travelers. Amazon And while insurers are well known for offering cover for even the most outlandish of risks, at a price, potential accidents in space are not yet among them. ""Space tourism involves significant risk, but is not an issue life insurers specifically ask about as yet because it is so rare for anyone to travel into space,"" Insurance Information Institute (III) spokesperson Michael Barry said. There is a nearly $500 million market to insure satellites, rockets and unmanned space flight, but no legal requirement for an operator such as Blue Origin, which Bezos founded, to insure passengers for injury or death or for space tourists to have life cover, brokers and insurers said. ""We're not aware of a case where anybody is insured against passenger liability,"" Neil Stevens, senior vice president, aviation and space at Marsh Assuming they lift-off as planned next month, Bezos and the other wannabe astronauts on Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft will not only spend several minutes 62 miles (100 km) above the earth in a truck-sized capsule, they also have to get back. The only group that has regularly flown humans sub-orbitally since the 1960s is Branson's Virgin Galactic. All have been tests, with one failure in 2014 resulting in a death. Blue Origin has flown 15 unmanned sub-orbital flights with no failures, Seradata SpaceTrak data showed on June 10. Bezos, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on their insurance plans and flight records. 'DIFFERENT RISK PROFILES' Being uninsured in space is nothing new. NASA and the U.S., in general, do not buy liability cover, with government launches basically insured by taxpayers, Richard Parker of Assure Space, a unit of insurer AmTrust Financial that provides space insurance, said. NASA astronauts are eligible for government life insurance programs, a NASA spokesperson said in an emailed response. Charles Wetton, underwriting manager for space policies at insurer Global Aerospace, said astronauts on government-funded missions are carefully selected for their knowledge, skills and fitness and train for several years before blast off. ""They and their families understand the risks of the work they do, Wetton said. But commercial space cadets may only get a few days of training for a sub-orbital flight or a few months for a ride to the International Space Station (ISS), Wetton said, adding: ""These represent two very different risk profiles that insurers will take into account"". Blue Origin on its website says the spaceflight passenger will receive training the day before the launch, including mission and vehicle overviews, safety briefings, mission simulation and instruction on in-flight activities. Virgin Galactic said participants will get three days of training and preparation before the launch. Insurers expect iron clad waivers and contracts from commercial space travel firms, stating they will bear no burden if a passenger dies during a flight. NASA has called for responses from the industry for its plans for a liability framework for privately-funded astronaut missions to the ISS. NASA's plans include requiring private astronauts to buy life insurance. It is still early days, but cover for space tourists may be the next step, said Tim Rush, senior vice president, U.S. space, at insurance broker Gallagher, adding that the life insurance market currently provides individual cover of $2-5 million for private astronauts. The only mandatory insurance in place for commercial space operators is third-party liability, mainly to cover property damage on earth or to a flying aircraft, said Akiko Hama, client executive, space and aerospace underwriting at Global Aerospace. Blue Origin plans for its six-seater spacecraft to take off on July 20 and fly for four minutes beyond the boundary between the earth's atmosphere and outer space, where passengers will experience total weightlessness.  MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION A key question for how the sector develops is whether risks related to tourism fall under space or aviation insurance lines, insurers and brokers told Reuters. The U.N. Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention of 1972 governs all activities in space and very few countries have a legal framework for commercial human spaceflight, they said. The first-ever aviation insurance policy was written by Lloyd's of London (SOLYD.UL) in 1911. A few years later the market insured Charles Lindbergh and his single-engine plane for $18,000 on its non-stop flight from the United States to Europe. Space trips are different, said Marsh's Stevens, because the passengers are returning to the same place as they left, making it technically a domestic trip to which international aviation insurance cannot be applied, meaning there will also be no limitation to liability. ""The aviation, aircraft insurance market, and the like, are less keen to take on risks that involve spacecraft,"" he said, adding that whether space tourism trips fall under aviation or space insurance is a ""million dollar question"". While air travel is governed by rules that establish airline liability in the case of death of passengers, Stevens said he was unaware of plans for similar rules for space tourism. However, Wetton said Global Aerospace had started to receive enquiries from companies for sub-orbital missions. ""In 10 years' time, maybe the two lines, aviation and spaceflight will look very similar,"" said Assure Space's Parker. ""Some legislative somewhere will say, look, we're now having average Joes flying on these launch vehicles and need to protect them,"" Parker added. Our Standards: Southwest Airlines said it expects ""more normal"" operations on Tuesday after it canceled more than 2,200 flights since Saturday."
science,Meet Nesher Ramla Homo - new early human discovered at Israeli cement site," TEL AVIV, June 24 (Reuters) - Scientists said on Thursday they had discovered a new kind of early human after studying pieces of fossilised bone dug up at a site used by a cement plant in central Israel. The fragments of a skull and a lower jaw with teeth were about 130,000 years old and could force a rethinkof parts of the human family tree, the researchers from Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said. Nesher Ramla Homo - named after the place southeast of Tel Aviv where it was found - may have lived alongside our species, Homo sapiens, for more than 100,000 years, and may have even interbred, according to the findings. The early humans, who had very large teeth and no chin, may have also been ancestors of the Neanderthals, the study added, challenging the current thinking that our evolutionary cousins originated in Europe. ""The discovery of a new type of Homo is of great scientific importance,"" said Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University, one of the leaders of the team that analysed the remains. ""It enables us to make new sense of previously found human fossils, add another piece to the puzzle of human evolution, and understand the migrations of humans in the old world."" Dr Yossi Zaidner of the Hebrew University found the fossils while exploring the mining area of the Nesher cement plant near the city of Ramla, the universities said in their statement. TOOLS AND BONES Excavators uncovered the bones about eight metres (25 feet) deep among stone tools and the bones of horses and deer. The study said the Nesher Ramla resembled pre-Neanderthal groups in Europe. ""This is what makes us suggest that this Nesher Ramla group is actually a large group that started very early in time and are the source of the European Neanderthal,"" said Hila May, a physical anthropologist at the Dan David Center and the Shmunis Institute of Tel Aviv University Experts have never been able to fully explain how Homo sapiens genes were present in the earlier Neanderthal population in Europe, May said, and the Nesher Ramla may be the mystery group responsible. The jaw bone had no chin and the skull was flat, she said. 3D shape analysis later ruled out relation to any other known group. What they did match, May said, were a small number of enigmatic human fossils found elsewhere in Israel, dating back even earlier, that anthropologists had never been able to place. ""As a crossroads between Africa, Europe and Asia, the Land of Israel served as a melting pot where different human populations mixed with one another, to later spread throughout the Old World,"" said Dr Rachel Sarig, from Tel Aviv University.

science,"Frog whisperer: Australian scientist speaks to frogs, fears their silence"," SYDNEY, June 24 (Reuters) - Wading through a moonlit pond on Australia's east coast talking to frogs makes Michael Mahony feel like a kid again. The 70-year-old biology professor and conservationist at Australia's University of Newcastle has mastered imitating and understanding the shrills, croaks and whistles of frogs. ""Sometimes you forget to work because, you know, you just want to talk to the frogs for a while and it's sort of good fun,"" Mahony told Reuters from a pond in Cooranbong, New South Wales. He is thrilled every time they call back, but fears frogs are increasingly at risk of going silent. Australia has about 240 frog species, but around 30% of them are threatened by climate change, water pollution, habitat loss, the chytrid fungus, and in a variety of other ways. Globally frogs are the most threatened of all vertebrates, Mahony said. Over his career, Mahony has described 15 new species of frogs. He has also seen some wiped out. ""Probably the saddest part of my career is that as a young person, I discovered a frog and within two years of it being discovered that frog went extinct,"" Mahony said. ""So very early in my career I became aware just how vulnerable some of our frogs were. We need to be looking at our habitats and asking what is wrong."" Beyond working to preserve amphibian habitats across Australia, Mahony has helped to develop a cryopreservation method to help bring frogs back from the edge of extinction by ""banking"" genetic material. ""What we've done in the face of the problems of catastrophic loss of species is to establish the first genome bank for Australian frogs,"" he said. Mahony also contributed with other scientists to a study by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) that found nearly three billion Australian animals were killed or displaced by bushfires in 2019 and 2020, including 51 million frogs. Mahony's passion for conservation has also rubbed off on his students. One of them, Simon Clulow, named a newly discovered frog ""Mahony's Toadlet"" in his honour in 2016. Some students have taken up his technique of calling and talking to frogs as well. ""I've never been into yelling at them to find out where they are,"" University of Newcastle doctoral student and frog researcher Samantha Wallace said.

science,"Archaeologist discovers 6,000 year-old island settlement off Croatian coast"," LUMBARDA, Croatia, June 24 (Reuters) - Archaeologist Mate Parica was examining satellite images of Croatia's coastline when he spotted something unusual. ""I thought: maybe it is natural, maybe not,"" said Parica, a professor at the University of Zadar. The image showed a large, shallow area on the seabed jutting out from the eastern shore of the island of Korcula. Parica and a colleague decided to dive at the site and discovered what they believe is a Neolithic settlement from around 4,500 years BC, built on a small piece of land that was connected to the main island by a narrow strip. The pair found the remains of stone walls which had surrounded the settlement, as well as tools and other objects used by the inhabitants. ""We found some ceramic objects and flint knives,"" he said. Marta Kalebota who runs the archaeological collection in the Korcula town museum, said the settlement's location was highly unusual. ""We are not aware at the moment of a similar finding elsewhere that a Neolithic settlement was built on an islet connected with a narrow strip of land,"" she said. Parica also said the island settlement discovery was atypical and that Neolithic finds were mostly made in caves. ""The fortunate thing is that this area, unlike most parts of the Mediterranean, is safe from big waves as many islands protect the coast. That certainly helped preserve the site from natural destruction,"" he said.

science,Chilean scientists repurpose CO2 monitors to stop COVID spread indoors," SANTIAGO, June 23 (Reuters) - Chilean researchers have repurposed a carbon dioxide detector model to warn of the risk of contracting COVID-19 in enclosed spaces. The prototype measures air pollution which, in a room with people, would include the coronavirus if anyone was infected since it is known to circulate via exhaled vapor. The device, which is not yet for sale, uploads data to the cloud and issues an audio alert if ventilation is insufficient that could result in COVID-19 transmissions. The monitor, developed by the University of Chile's Center for Mathematical Modeling and Center of Excellence in Astrophysics and Technologies Related, is already being tested in university campuses in the South American country. ""If you are in a place that does not have combustion, the only source of CO2 is people,"" Ricardo Finger, an electrical engineer at the University of Chile, said in an interview. ""But if you measure the amounts of CO2 in the air, you can estimate how much air one person is breathing that has already been breathed by another."" Carbon dioxide concentration, as well as temperature and humidity levels, are transmitted by radio signals to a control panel, which can monitor dozens of sensors at the same time. ""CO2 sensors have been around for a long time, but the difference is that they had not previously been considered to confront coronavirus contagion,"" Finger said. ""The focus had been given mainly on surfaces, on contact, in washing hands and it had been ruled out that contagion could occur purely by air.""

Prostate cancer drug improves COVID-19 survival in trial An experimental prostate cancer drug improved the survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Brazil in a clinical trial, researchers reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The drug, proxalutamide being developed by Kintor Pharmaceuticals Mildly ill young COVID-19 patients report lasting symptoms More than half of young adults with mild COVID-19 who self-isolated at home were still reporting troublesome after-effects six months later, a study from Norway published on Wednesday in Nature Medicine found. The study included 312 COVID-19 survivors over age 16, with illnesses of varying severity. Overall, at six months, 189 patients, or 61%, reported persistent symptoms. Of the 61 patients between the ages of 16 and 30 who had only been mildly ill, 32 (52%) continued to have symptoms at six months, including loss of taste and smell (28%), fatigue (21%), trouble breathing (13%), impaired cognition (13%) and memory problems (11%). The researchers said their patients' high rate of persistent fatigue ""is striking"" and appears higher than what is usually seen after other common viral infections, such as influenza, mononucleosis and dengue. ""Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic,"" they conclude, the findings should prompt ""population-wide mass vaccination"" and other infection control measures. ( Worrisome Delta variant becoming dominant in U.S. The highly transmissible coronavirus variants first identified in India and Brazil, now known as Delta and Gamma, respectively, are quickly displacing the Alpha (UK) variant as the most common in the United States, according to a large new study of positive COVID-19 tests from across the country. The percentage of COVID-19 cases due to Alpha dropped from 70% in mid-April 2021 to 42% just 6 weeks later, researchers from Helix, a California-based genomics company, reported in a paper posted on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The Gamma and Delta variants were ""the primary drivers for this displacement,"" the researchers said. The growth rate of Delta is higher than that of Gamma and is particularly high in counties with vaccination rates below 28.5%, they found. Delta has been widely reported to be even more transmissible than Alpha and to cause more severe disease and hospitalizations.

Well, they don't, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working hard to solve what is one of the most thorny tasks in space - washing clothes. The space agency is planning to conduct a series of experiments using specially designed detergents from Procter and Gamble The vital nature of water on space missions has meant that astronauts have simply jettisoned used clothes, happy in the knowledge they will disintegrate as they re-enter the atmosphere. As a result, NASA sends 160 pounds of clothing per crew member to the International Space Station per year. For the longer run, with the U.S. agency and Elon Musk's Space X eyeing manned missions to Mars, there needs to be a more sustainable solution. Labeled NASA Tide after P&G's main washing powder, the first tests on the new detergent to evaluate the effects of micro-gravity and radiation will take place on a cargo flight to the ISS next year and, subsequently, in the space station itself. P&G will also send some additional equipment for treatment and image analysis, even though the ISS has most of the equipment necessary for the experiments. Identical experiments will be conducted on Earth at the same time, using the same materials in order to study the differences, P&G said.

science,Fish once labeled a 'living fossil' surprises scientists again," June 18 (Reuters) - The coelacanth - a wondrous fish that was thought to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs 66 million years ago before unexpectedly being found alive and well in 1938 off South Africa's east coast - is offering up even more surprises. Scientists said a new study of these large and nocturnal deep-sea denizens shows that they boast a lifespan about five times longer than previously believed - roughly a century - and that females carry their young for five years, the longest-known gestation period of any animal. Focusing on one of the two living species of coelacanth (pronounced SEE-lah-canth), the scientists also determined that it develops and grows at among the slowest pace of any fish and does not reach sexual maturity until about age 55. The researchers used annual growth rings deposited on the fish's scales to determine the age of individual coelacanths  - ""just as one reads tree rings,"" said marine biologist Kélig Mahé of the French oceanographic institution IFREMER, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Current Biology. Coelacanths first appeared during the Devonian Period roughly 400 million years ago, about 170 million years before the dinosaurs. Based on the fossil record, they were thought to have vanished during the mass extinction that wiped out about three-quarters of Earth's species following an asteroid strike at the end of the Cretaceous Period. After being found alive, the coelacanth was dubbed a ""living fossil,"" a description now shunned by scientists. ""By definition, a fossil is dead, and the coelacanths have evolved a lot since the Devonian,"" said biologist and study co-author Marc Herbin of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. It is called a lobe-finned fish based on the shape of its fins, which differ structurally from other fish. Such fins are thought to have paved the way for the limbs of the first land vertebrates to evolve. Coelacanths reside at ocean depths of as much as half a mile (800 meters). During daylight hours they stay in volcanic caves alone or in small groups. Females are somewhat larger than males, reaching about seven feet (two meters) long and weighing 240 pounds (110 kg). The two extant species, both endangered, are the African coelacanth, found mainly near the Comoro Islands off the continent's east coast, and the Indonesian coelacanth. The study focused on the African coelacanth, using scales from 27 individuals in two museum collections. Previous research had suggested roughly a 20-year lifespan and among the fastest body growth of any fish. It turns out that this was based on a misreading decades ago of another type of ring deposited in the scales. ""After reappraisal of the coelacanth's life history based on our new age estimation, it appears to be one of the slowest - if not the slowest - among all fish, close to deep-sea sharks and roughies,"" said IFREMER marine evolutionary ecologist and study co-author Bruno Ernande. ""A centenarian lifespan is quite something,"" Ernande added. The Greenland shark, a big deep-ocean predator, Ernande said the researchers were astounded when they figured out the coelacanth's record gestation period, which exceeds the 3.5 years of frilled sharks and the two years of elephants and spiny dogfish sharks. The researchers said late sexual maturity and a lengthy gestation period, combined with low fecundity and a small population size, makes coelacanths particularly sensitive to natural or human-caused environmental disturbances such as extreme climate events or too much accidental fishing.

science,Echoes of neurodegenerative disease in fatal COVID-19; sleep woes may add risk," June 21 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. COVID-19 brains show inflammation, ""circuitry"" problems The brain inflammation and impaired ""brain circuitry"" seen in people who die of COVID-19 look a lot like what doctors see in the brains of people who die of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, researchers reported on Monday in the journal Nature. Analyses of brain tissue from eight people who died from COVID-19 and 14 others who died from other causes showed ""striking changes"" in the COVID-19 patients' brains, Stanford University researcher Tony Wyss-Coray told Reuters. His team at Stanford, with colleagues at the University of Saarbruecken in Germany, analyzed thousands of genes in each of 65,309 individual cells taken from the brain-tissue samples. Genes involved with cognition, schizophrenia and depression were more often ""turned on"" in the COVID-19 patients' brains, they found. ""There also were signs of distress in neurons in the cerebral cortex, the brain region that plays a key role in decision-making, memory and mathematical reasoning,"" the researchers said in a statement. ""These neurons ... form complex logic circuits that perform those higher brain functions."" Wyss-Coray said his team could not find the virus itself in the brain, which suggests that ""virus infection in the rest of the body could be enough to cause neurological symptoms, even in people who do not die from the disease."" The findings, Wyss-Coray noted in a statement, ""may help explain the brain fog, fatigue and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms of long COVID."" ( Poor sleep history linked with more severe COVID-19 Poor sleep habits may be linked with higher risk for severe illness in patients with COVID-19, according to Harvard University researchers. They analyzed survey responses from more than 46,000 participants in the long-term UK Biobank study, including 8,422 who tested positive for COVID-19. Participants had answered questions from 2006 to 2010 about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and body clocks. For the new study, based on their responses, the researchers assigned scores ranging from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating multiple poor sleep ""traits."" In participants with COVID-19, poor scores were associated with higher odds of death. This was true even after researchers accounted for issues known to be risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes such as sleep apnea, obesity and smoking, they reported on Friday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Even people with two occasional or one frequent poor sleep trait appeared to experience higher risks for hospitalization and death, although the difference was not statistically significant and more study is needed to confirm the finding, the researchers said. Poor sleep affects the immune system and blood clotting, both of which are key to the body's fight against COVID-19, and ""tracking sleep behavior may have importance in identifying those at increased risk for COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization,"" the authors said. ( Most COVID-19 antibody drugs likely work against variants Most COVID-19 antibody drugs that are approved for emergency use in the United States - and some that are still in development - are likely to protect against variants of the novel coronavirus, new data suggests. In test tube experiments, and in mice and hamsters, researchers exposed the antibodies, alone and in combinations, to ""engineered"" versions of mutated virus and to actual virus obtained from patients infected with Alpha, Beta, or Gamma variants - first identified in Britain, South Africa and Brazil, respectively - or variants first seen in New York, California or India. Some individual drugs appeared to lose effectiveness against the variants in test tubes - but in the animals, low doses of most of the drugs, given in combinations, were protective, the researchers reported on Monday in the journal Nature. Another advantage of the combinations is that they ""seemed to prevent the emergence of resistant viruses,"" study co-author Jacco Boon of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis said in the statement. ""Resistance arose with some of the monotherapies, but never with combination therapy.""

science,Chinese astronauts board space station module in historic mission," JIUQUAN, China, June 17 (Reuters) - Three Chinese astronauts on Thursday flew to an unfinished space station in China?�s first crewed mission since 2016, The astronauts rode to Tianhe - the module that will be the living quarters of China's completed space station - on Shenzhou-12, or ""Divine Vessel"". The crew boarded the module, where they will live for three months, the longest stay in low-Earth orbit by any Chinese national. China's space station, due to be finished by end-2022, will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, U.S.-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024. If the ISS - backed mainly by the United States, Russia, Japan, Europe and Canada - is decommissioned, China would be the operator of the only active space station. That would potentially give it greater power in shaping future norms and regulations for near-Earth space, ""At this current stage, we haven't considered the participation of international astronauts, but their future participation will be guaranteed,"" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space programme. ""I'm aware that many countries have expressed their wish in this regard,"" Zhou told foreign reporters at the Shenzhou launch site in northwestern Gansu province. Shenzhou-12 is the third of 11 missions - four of which will be crewed - needed to complete China's first full-fledged space station. Construction began in April with the launch of Tianhe, a cylinder-like module slightly bigger than a city bus. The Shenzhou-12 astronauts Nie Haisheng, 56, Liu Boming, 54, and Tang Hongbo, 45, will test out technologies on Tianhe including its life-support system. They will also be monitored for how they fare in space physically and psychologically. An upcoming mission to the space station will last six months. Barred by U.S. law from working with NASA and by extension on the ISS, China has spent the past decade developing technologies to build its own space station, in addition to planning missions to the moon, Mars and other planets. China plans to allow Hong Kong astronauts to join future missions, Zhou also said. 'FIRST BATON' ""This will be the first crewed flight in the space station (construction) phase, and I'm lucky to be able to have the 'first baton',"" Nie told reporters a day before the launch. The veteran astronaut has been hailed by his team as a bastion of stability and a teacher figure who constantly challenges others with tough questions. ""As long as we have him in our hearts, we have nothing to fear,"" fellow astronaut Wang Yaping, who is part of the Shenzhou-12 backup team, told state media previously. ""In our crew, elder brother Nie is like the needle that stills the sea,"" she said. Liu Boming, like Nie, was from the first batch of astronauts selected in the 1990s for China's space programme. Known for his intellect, Liu is often addressed by his colleagues as ""Little Zhuge"", the renowned military strategist who lived in China two millennia ago. On the Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008, Liu famously used a crowbar to pry open the hatch after it refused to open. Former air force pilot Tang Hongbo, 45, was from a later batch of astronauts, and trained for more than a decade before being selected for his first spaceflight on Shenzhou-12. ""I've waited for 11 years, and finally I'm ready, and I can contribute my strength,"" Tang told reporters on Wednesday. Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China?�s first space walk ever on the 2008 Shenzhou mission.

science,China fossils show new species of extinct giant rhino that roamed Asia," BEIJING, June 18 (Reuters) - Fossils found in northwest China's Gansu province indicate a new species of giant rhino that lived more than 26 million years ago, according to a paper published in the journal Communications Biology on Thursday. The fossils including a skull and two vertebrae found in the reddish-brown sandstone of the Linxia basin shed light on how the ancient rhinos, some of the largest land mammals ever,  evolved and moved across what is now Asia. The dispersal of giant rhino fossils - others have been found on the far side of the Himalayas in Pakistan - indicate ""Tibet, as a plateau, did not yet exist and was not yet a barrier to exchange of largest land mammals,"" the paper said. Giant rhinos like the newly discovered species, named Paraceratherium linxiaense, were hornless, long-necked herbivores, perhaps weighing 20 tonnes - equal to several elephants - and likely living in open woodland. Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,Pioneering space reproduction research yields healthy baby mice," June 15 (Reuters) - Trail-blazing space reproduction research that yielded healthy baby mice produced using freeze-dried sperm stored for years in orbit is showing the possibilities of procreation beyond Earth, with future implications for humans exploring the cosmos. Scientists said they produced 168 offspring using mouse sperm cells that were stored aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for five years and 10 months and then rehydrated back on Earth, injected into unfertilized egg cells and transferred into female mice at a Japanese laboratory. The sperm cells were exposed to radiation 170 times greater than sperm kept in ground storage for comparative purposes at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Tsukuba Space Center. The higher radiation levels present in space are attenuated by Earth's atmosphere. University of Yamanashi developmental biologist Teruhiko Wakayama, who helped lead the study published in the journal Science Advances, said the space radiation did not damage the sperm's DNA or reduce its fertilization ability compared to the ground-stored sperm. The baby mice were just as healthy as those produced using ground-stored sperm, with normal appearance and no abnormalities in gene functioning, Wakayama added. Their offspring - and even their grandchildren - also were healthy, Wakayama said. Scientists are seeking a greater understanding of how space conditions affect reproduction. There is concern that greater radiation levels could foster harmful mutations and that reduced or zero gravity conditions could impede embryonic development. Previous research in orbit has involved animals such as fruit flies and fish. The study examined radiation's effect on the male reproductive cell - or gamete - but not the issue of gravity. It was the first space study involving mammalian reproductive cells. ""If space radiation results in mutations, maybe the next generation would be changed a little bit. However, if animals live in space for many generations, the mutations would accumulate,"" Wakayama said. ""We have to know how to protect against this."" Wakayama said that in August researchers will send frozen early-stage mouse embryos to the ISS, where they will be thawed and cultured under zero-gravity conditions. ""By this experiment, we will know whether gravity is essential for mammalian embryo development or not,"" Wakayama said. These issues might be of concern if humankind in the future establishes off-world colonies - perhaps on the moon or Mars or in large space stations - or Wakayama said the findings regarding freeze-dried mouse sperm suggest that this method could be used for human reproduction in space if such long missions are realized. The freeze-dried sperm was sent to the ISS in 2013 inside lightweight capsules, then was stored in a freezer aboard the space station and sent back to Earth in 2019 in the longest biological research involving the orbiting laboratory. The researchers estimated that freeze-dried sperm could be safely stored in the ISS for about 200 years. Because it is small and lightweight - and thus inexpensive to transport - animal reproductive cells could be stored in this manner as easily as plant seeds, they added. ""In order for humans to thrive in space, we would need to maintain the genetic diversity not only of people but also of livestock and even pets,"" Wakayama said. Genetic diversity protects against the accumulation of harmful mutations seen in inbreeding. Carrying freeze-dried reproductive cells from large numbers of individuals would be easier than transporting the animals themselves and could enable space colonies to have animals for food and companionship, Wakayama added. Our Standards: Slovak prosecutors confirmed on Wednesday that ECB policymaker and Slovak central bank Governor Peter Kazimir had been charged with a corruption-related crime."
science,Major milestones in Chinese space exploration," BEIJING, June 17 (Reuters) - China launched a spacecraft on Thursday carrying three astronauts to the main module of the country's space station, its first crewed mission in nearly five years. China's first full-fledged space station is still under construction. When completed, it will be the only rival to the International Space Station (ISS) backed by the United States, Japan and Russia. China has never participated in the ISS. Here is a timeline of key moments in Chinese space exploration: July 19, 1964: China took its first official step into space, launching and recovering an experimental biological rocket carrying white mice. April 24, 1970: The first Chinese satellite, Dong Fang Hong 1, was launched from the Jiuquan launch centre in the northwestern province of Gansu. That made China the fifth country to send satellites into orbit, following the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Japan. Nov. 26, 1975: China launched its first recoverable satellite. Nov. 20, 1999: China launched its first unmanned spacecraft, the Shenzhou-1. Oct. 15, 2003: China became the third country after the United States and Russia to send a man into space with its own rocket. Astronaut Yang Liwei spent about 21 hours in space aboard the Shenzhou-5 spacecraft. Oct. 12, 2005: China sent two men on a five-day flight on its Shenzhou-6 spacecraft. Nov. 5, 2007: China's first lunar orbiter, Chang'e-1, entered the moon's orbit 12 days after takeoff. Sept. 25, 2008: China's third manned spacecraft, Shenzhou-7, was launched into space, where an astronaut clambered out of the spacecraft for the nation's first space walk. Oct. 1, 2010: China's second lunar exploration probe blasted off from a remote corner of the southwestern province of Sichuan. Sept. 29, 2011: The Tiangong-1, or ""Heavenly Palace 1"", China's first space lab, was launched to carry out docking and orbiting experiments. Nov. 3, 2011: China carried out its first docking exercise between two unmanned spacecraft, the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft and Tiangong-1 module, a key test to securing a long-term manned presence in space. Dec. 14, 2013: China landed an unmanned spacecraft on the moon in the first ""soft-landing"" since 1976, joining the United States and the former Soviet Union in accomplishing the feat. Sept. 15, 2016：China launched its second experimental space laboratory, the Tiangong-2, part of a broader plan to have a permanent manned space station in service around 2022. Jan. 3, 2019: The Chang'e-4 lunar probe, launched in December, touched down on the far side of the moon. Previous spacecraft have flown over the far side but not landed on it. June 23, 2020: China put into orbit its final Beidou satellite, completing a navigation network years in the making and setting the stage to challenge the U.S.-owned Global Positioning System (GPS). July 23, 2020: China launched an unmanned probe to Mars in its first independent mission to another planet. Nov. 24, 2020: China launched an uncrewed mission, the Chang'e-5, with the aim of collecting lunar material to help scientists learn more about the moon's origins. Dec. 1, 2020: China landed the Chang'e-5 probe on the moon's surface. April 29, 2021: China launched Tianhe, the first and largest of three modules of its upcoming space station. May 15, 2021: China became the second country after the United States to land a robotic rover on the surface of Mars. June 17, 2021: China launched the crewed Shenzhou-12 spacecraft to dock with Tianhe.

science,Bid of $28 million wins a rocket trip to space with Bezos," SEATTLE, June 12 (Reuters) - A seat on a spaceship ride with billionaire Jeff Bezos went for $28 million during a live auction on Saturday, concluding the month-long bidding process for the sightseeing trip on the Blue Origin?�s maiden voyage next month. Within four minutes of the open of Saturday's live phone auction, bids reached beyond $20 million. The bidding closed seven minutes after the auction began. The identity of the winner - presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado - was not immediately disclosed. The July 20 launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard booster from West Texas would be a landmark moment as U.S. firms strive toward a new era of private commercial space travel. Blue Origin's founder and Amazon.com Inc ""To see the earth from space, changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity,"" Bezos said in a video before the final bidding took place, adding that his brother Mark will join him on the trip. As the month-long bidding process leading up to the live auction closed on Thursday, the winning figure stood at $4.8  million, fueled by entries from more than 6,000 people from at least 143 countries, Blue Origin said. ""Putting the world's richest man and one of the most recognized figures in business into space is a massive advertisement for space as a domain for exploration, industrialization and investment,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told clients earlier this month. While the funds raised from the event are earmarked for charity, Blue Origin is hoping to galvanize enthusiasm for its nascent suborbital tourism business. However, Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc The race is fueled by optimism that space travel will become mainstream as nascent technology is proven and costs fall, fueling what UBS estimates could be a $3 billion annual tourism market by 2030. Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, as well as Musk's SpaceX, have also discussed using their rockets to link far-flung global cities. UBS says that long-haul travel market could be worth more than $20 billion, though several barriers such as air-safety certification could derail the plans. Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips. Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.

science,How primates are aiding the fight against COVID-19 in Louisiana," COVINGTON, La., June 10 (Reuters) - On a 500-acre (200-hectare) plot of land near a small Louisiana town north of New Orleans, about 5,000 monkeys climb and lounge in an enclosure. Many of the primates, mostly rhesus macaques, at the Tulane National Research Center are destined for use in scientific research, including in experiments for COVID-19. The facility, with high-level biosafety laboratories able to handle biological threat agents like anthrax, was well-positioned to pivot quickly to COVID-19 research when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Primates' DNA and physiological features make them ideal models for human comparison when studying diseases, said Skip Bohm, associate director and chief veterinary medical officer at the Tulane center. ""Non-human primates are really critical for us to understand not only the disease and how it affects the organism but also to compare treatments, therapies, vaccinations,"" Bohm told Reuters. Rhesus macaques, the primate species most commonly used for scientific research, make up the majority of the center's breeding colony and the 200 adult animals used in its coronavirus experiments over the past year. COVID-19-related studies by the center include one published in the National Academy of Sciences scientific journal in February that found older individuals with high body mass index and more severe COVID-19 infection exhaled more respiratory droplets, allowing them to become so-called 'super-spreaders.' Primates were the crux of the study, said Chad Roy, study coauthor and the center's director of infectious disease aerobiology. Among future work, the center plans to study ""long COVID,"" the incidence of one in 10 diagnosed patients remaining unwell long after their acute infection. ""There are many different therapeutics that are coming online that need to be tested, and with the network that we have, we can compare one treatment to another,"" said center director Jay Rappaport, referring to the facility's role coordinating the COVID-19 work of the seven U.S. primate research centers. Once experiments are concluded, the Tulane center euthanizes the monkeys for tissue collection, allowing researchers to study COVID-19's impact beyond the respiratory system. Kathy Guillermo, of laboratory investigations at the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), said primates should not be used for testing. ""They wouldn't have to kill them if they didn't use them,"" she said. ""What we're going to learn of value is going to be what we learn from human beings.""

science,"Tiny creature comes back to life after 24,000 years in Siberian deep freeze"," MOSCOW, June 9 (Reuters) - (This June 9 story refiles to correct headline to clarify creature is not a worm) A microscopic organism has wriggled back to life and reproduced asexually after lying frozen in the vast permafrost lands of northeastern Siberia for 24,000 years. Russian scientists found the tiny, ancient animal called the bdelloid rotifer in soil taken from the river Alazeya in Russia's region of Yakutia in the far north. The bdelloid rotifer, a multicellular organism found in freshwater habitats across the world, is known to be able to withstand extreme cold. Previous research suggested it could survive for a decade when frozen at -20 degrees Celsius. This new case, which was detailed in a The organism was recovered from samples taken 3.5 metres below ground. The material was dated from between 23,960 and 24,485 years ago, the study said.

science,"New dinosaur species discovered in Australia, one of world's biggest"," SYDNEY, June 8 (Reuters) - Scientists have confirmed the discovery of a new dinosaur species in Australia, one of the largest found in the world, more than a decade after cattle farmers first uncovered bones of the animal. The plant-eating sauropod lived in the Cretaceous period between 92 million and 96 million years ago when Australia was attached to Antartica, according to a Paleontologists estimated the dinosaur reached a height of 5-6.5 metres at the hip and 25-30 metres in length, making it as long as a basketball court and as tall as a two storey building. That makes the new species the largest dinosaur ever found in Australia and puts it in the top five in the world, joining an elite group of titanosaurs previously only discovered in South America. ""Discoveries like this are just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Queensland Museum curator and palaeontologist Scott Hocknull. Paleontologists have named the sauropod ""Australotitan cooperensis"", combining ""southern titan"" with the name of a creek near where the first of the creature's bones were found in 2006 on a cattle farming property in Eromanga in Queensland state. The confirmation of the new species marks a seventeen-year long journey to first unearth and then compare the bones of ""Cooper"", as the dinosaur is more informally known, to other finds. Dinosaur bones are enormous, heavy and fragile, and are kept in museums around the world, making scientific study difficult. The team from the Eromanga Natural History Museum and the Queensland Museum used new digital technology for the first time to 3-D scan each bone for comparisons. ""To make sure Australotitan was a different species, we needed to compare its bones to the bones of other species from Queensland and globally,"" Hocknull said. ""This was a very long and painstaking task."" Robyn Mackenzie, who was mustering cattle with her husband Stuart on their property when they discovered the bones, founded the Eromanga Natural History Museum to house the find. A swath of further discoveries of dinosaur skeletons in the area, along with a rock-shelf believed to have been a sauropod pathway, are still awaiting full scientific study. ""Palaeo Tourism has been huge globally so we're expecting a lot of international interest when our borders re-open,"" said Mackenzie, now a field paleontologist. Hocknull said even larger dinosaur specimens are waiting to be discovered, given the plant-eating sauropods were generally preyed on by huge theropods. ""We've found a couple of small theropod dinosaurs in Australia ... but it wouldn't have bothered Australotitan, which suggests there is a very large predatory dinosaur out there somewhere. We just haven't found it yet.""

science,Relativity Space raises $650 mln for bigger 3D-printed rocket," SEATTLE, June 8 (Reuters) - Venture-backed startup Relativity Space, which aims to build the world's first fleet of 3D-printed rockets, said on Tuesday it has raised $650 million from a raft of new investors including BlackRock, hedge fund Soroban Capital, and the actor Jared Leto. Though it has yet to launch a rocket, the latest capital raise gives Relativity a market valuation of $4.2 billion, making it the second-most valuable privately-held space firm behind Elon Musk's SpaceX. The funding is vital to accelerating production of Relativity's new booster, Terran R, set to enter service in 2024 as a rival to SpaceX's pioneering and dominant medium-lift reusable Falcon 9 workhorse, Relativity's CEO Tim Ellis said. Long Beach, California-based Relativity, which has grown its headcount fourfold in little over a year, promises boosters built almost entirely by colossal 3D printers that can crank out a full-scale rocket in just 60 days. Such automation is vital to human ambitions to colonize Mars, Ellis said. ""3D printing is the holy grail that will enable that future,"" Ellis told Reuters ahead of the announcement. The fundraising announcement is the latest in a frenzy of capital infusions and blank-check deal-making focused on a new breed of firms building launch systems that are far smaller than traditional rockets. The plan is to cash in on the exponential growth of compact satellites used for everything from communications to national security to climate studies needing a ride to orbit in the coming years. Industry insiders do not expect all the players to survive this gold rush. Among the frontrunners are U.S.-New Zealand startup Rocket Lab, billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace, and Relativity. Relativity has inked launch contracts with the U.S. Defense Department, NASA, and Iridium Communications Inc, for rides to space on its Terran 1. That rocket can blast up to 2,755 pounds (1,250 kg) into orbit for $12 million. Its inaugural launch is slated for December. By comparison, Rocket Lab's Electron rocket aims to send nearly 500 pounds (225 kg) to space for $5.7 million, and Firefly's Alpha rocket is expected to loft 2,200 pounds (1,000 kg) into low-Earth orbit at a cost of $15 million per flight. Relativity's bigger Terran R will be capable of blasting some 44,000 pounds (20,000 kilograms) to low-Earth orbit, Ellis said, declining to disclose the cost for a trip. A ride on SpaceX's Falcon 9 with a payload topping 50,000 pounds (22,700 kg) costs around $62 million. The $650 million round brings Relativity's total funding to $1.3 billion. It was led by Fidelity Management & Research Company with infusions from Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, and actor Jared Leto, among others, Relativity said. Ellis waved off any idea of taking the company public any time soon. ""We are excited to stay private,"" Ellis said.

science,French lecturer reaches for stars with astronaut application," ROUEN, France, June 8 (Reuters) - In a break from his job teaching engineering to students in France's Normandy region, Matthieu Pluvinage put the finishing touches on an application for a new job: astronaut. Pluvinage, 38, is taking advantage of a European Space Agency initiative to run an open recruitment drive for new astronauts for its manned flight programme. While he has never been a test pilot or served in the military - typical credentials for astronauts in the past - he ticks many of the boxes in the job description. He has a masters degree in science, he speaks English and French, he reckons he is fit enough to pass the medical, and he has a passion for space. ""There are things that make me think, 'I want to do this! It's cool!',"" said Pluvinage in his office at the ESIGELEC engineering school near Rouen, 140 km (90 miles) west of Paris, where he teaches. Pluvinage has a collection of books about Thomas Pesquet, the space engineer and airline pilot who this year became the first French commander of the International Space Station. Displayed on a computer monitor was his job application, still being drafted. He has until June 18 to submit it, and will know the result in October. The odds are long. He has not yet even entered the recruitment process. Competition will be stiff. To succeed, Pluvinage will need to get through six selection rounds. But he said he decided to take the risk because the next time the space agency puts out an open call for new astronauts, likely to be years from now, he may be too old.

On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother,"" Bezos, who is one of the richest people in the world, said in an Instagram post. Bezos, who is due to step down as Amazon's chief on July 5, will join the winner of an auction for a seat on the first space flight from Blue Origin. Bezos, fellow billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson have been investing billions of dollars on their rocket startups, but Bezos will be the first of the three to actually travel into space on a rocket developed by his own company. The Blue Origin spacecraft, which is set to carry Bezos and others, has undergone 15 test flights, none of which had any passengers onboard. Blue Origin closed the first round of the auction last month and said it had The current highest bid stood at $2.8 million in the ongoing second round of auction, according to Blue Origin's website. (www.blueorigin.com) Its New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes. The capsule features six observation windows and are nearly three times as tall as those on a Boeing 747 jetliner and the largest ever used in space, Blue Origin said. Bezos's rocket startup is targeting July 20 for its first suborbital sightseeing trip, a landmark moment in a competition to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.

science,'Divine Vessel' to mark China's first human spaceflight since 2016," BEIJING, June 14 (Reuters) - A Chinese spacecraft will blast off from the Gobi Desert on a Long March rocket in the coming days, ferrying three men to an orbiting space module for a three-month stay, the first time China has sent humans into space for nearly five years. Shenzhou-12, meaning ""Divine Vessel"", will be the third of 11 missions needed to complete China's space station by 2022. Among them, four will be missions with people on board, potentially propelling up to 12 Chinese astronauts into space - more than the 11 men and women that China has sent since 2003. The craft will also carry into space the hopes of some in Earth's most populous nation. ""The motherland is powerful,"" one person wrote on Chinese social media, which has lit up with well-wishes for the Shenzhou-12 crew. ""The launch is a gift to the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party."" Chinese astronauts have had a relatively low international profile. A U.S. law banning NASA from any connection with China means its astronauts have not been to the more than two-decade-old International Space Station, visited by more than 240 men and women of various nationalities. China, which aims to become a major spacefaring power by 2030, in May became the second country to put a rover on Mars, two years after landing the first spacecraft on the far side of the moon. It also plans to put astronauts on the moon - the farthest celestial body that humans have travelled to. THIS TIME, MEN The Shenzhou-12 crew is to live on the Tianhe, ""Harmony of the Heavens"", a cylinder 16.6 metres (55 feet) long and 4.2 metres (14 feet) in diameter. The planned three-month stay would break the country's record of 30 days, set by the 2016 mission - China's last crewed flight - of Chen Dong and Jing Haipeng to a prototype station. Three men from China's first and second batches of astronauts will be on this mission, Yang Liwei, director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office and China's first astronaut, told state tabloid Global Times last month. China's space bloggers speculate they will be Nie Haisheng - who at 56 would be China's oldest astronaut sent into space - Deng Qingming, 55, and Ye Guangfu, 40. The authorities typically do not announce a mission's crew until near or after the launch. China Manned Space did not respond to a Reuters fax request for comment. The oldest human in space was John Glenn, who flew on the space shuttle at age 77 in 1998 - after having been the first American to orbit the earth in 1962, a U.S. senator and a presidential candidate. While no women are scheduled for the Shenzhou-12 mission, they are expected to participate in every following mission, Yang told Global Times. Two women, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping, were selected in 2011 among China's second cohort, after the first batch of 14 men in the mid-1990s. Liu was China's first woman in space in 2012, while Wang was the youngest, at 33, in 2013. China began building its space station in April with the launch of Tianhe, the first and largest of its three modules.

science,China's Shenzhen dangles financial incentives to spur satellite sector," BEIJING, June 8 (Reuters) - China's southern tech city of Shenzhen said on Monday it would offer up to 300 million yuan ($47 million) in financial incentives per project as part of a push to become an innovation hub for satellite development and related industry applications. The city, in Guangdong province, will support projects with up to 40% of their total investment, or as much as 300 million yuan per project, its economic planning agency said. Shenzhen's push to develop its satellite industry chain is in line with ongoing efforts to transform itself into a smart city powered by artificial intelligence and big data. The beefing up of Shenzhen's satellite manufacturing and applications capabilities comes as the Greater Bay region - comprising Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau - develops its own satellite constellation. In April, two commercial remote-sensing satellites were launched by a Hong Kong-based satellite operator as part of the Golden Bauhinia project, which aims to eventually supply 11 city clusters in the Greater Bay region with near real-time data.

science,Russia to U.S. -Lift sanctions on space sector or we'll exit space station," MOSCOW, June 7 (Reuters) - The head of Russia's space agency on Monday suggested Moscow would withdraw from the International Space Station in 2025 unless Washington lifted sanctions on the space sector that were hampering Russian satellite launches. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, was addressing  parliamentarians ahead of a summit in Geneva later this month between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden. Rogozin said Moscow was struggling to launch some of its satellites because of U.S. sanctions which meant Russia could not import certain microchip sets needed for its space programme. ""We have more than enough rockets but nothing to launch them with,"" Rogozin said, in a rare admission by a senior Russian official that Western sanctions are seriously impeding the development of a given industry. ""We have spacecraft that are nearly assembled but they lack one specific microchip set that we have no way of purchasing because of the sanctions."" The United States and other Western countries began imposing sanctions against Russia in the wake of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. More recently, the U.S. has sanctioned Moscow over election meddling, cyber attacks and the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, allegations Moscow denies. Rogozin, who is under personal U.S. and EU personal sanctions, said Russia could withdraw from the International Space Station (ISS) in 2025 unless Washington lifted the sanctions against Russian space contractors soon. ""This is in the hands of our American partners,"" he said. Launched in 1998, the ISS is a multinational project and comprises two segments, a Russian one and another one used by the United States and other space agencies. U.S. space agency NASA favours continuing to use the ISS until at least 2030, and Bill Nelson, its chief, told CNN last week that a Russian exit could spark a new space race with Russia and China pitted against the United States. Moscow's relations with Washington plummeted to new post-Cold War lows earlier this year after U.S. President Joe Biden called his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a ""killer"" and imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including on the sovereign debt market.

science,Scientists saving endangered salmon get help from gene-slicing tool," ANTIOCH, California, June 7 (Reuters) - A gene-editing tool that has led to new cancer therapies and a rapid test for COVID-19 is now helping scientists find endangered species of salmon in the San Francisco Bay. The CRISPR-based Sherlock tool can identify four types of Chinook salmon, including Sacramento winter-run and Central Valley spring-run, which are both protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. ""The Chinook are a great fit actually because all of the runs, more or less, look the same,"" said Andrea Schreier, an adjunct associate professor at the University of California Davis and coauthor of ""They're visually very similar and the current method we have to identify the different types is based on what length they are at a particular age and it's not very accurate."" Sherlock, which stands for Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter Unlocking, identifies the fish using their genomic sequence. Researchers begin by taking swabs of mucus from the fish and combining with reagents that will glow if certain snippets of DNA are present. The battery-powered fluorescent reader gives results in 30 minutes, ideal for field research. By identifying the species, researchers believe they can better monitor population sizes and habitats. With Emily Funk, an associate specialist who joined the team in July 2020, said the conservation angle drew her to the project. ""I think it's important to preserve our ecosystems,"" she said. ""I hope we can save the fish in our oceans."" Melinda Baerwald, an environmental program manager with the California Department of Water Resources and coauthor of the study, plans to deploy the technology at water pumping stations, which can impact endangered species. ?�You don?�t have to wait for weeks or in some cases months to find out the answer to if you?�re impacting an endangered or threatened species,??she said, adding that they currently have to drive an hour and a half to a lab to confirm the identity of a species. ?�Instead, you can find out at the moment that you?�re actually interacting with that species if you are affecting it.??Our Standards: China said representatives from more than 100 countries have adopted the ""Kunming Declaration"" which calls for ""urgent and integrated action"" in creating a new global biodiversity pact."

science,'Reef stars' promote new growth in Bali's dying coral ecosystem," NUSA DUA, Indonesia, June 4 (Reuters) - Using a snorkel and protective gloves, Pariama Hutasoit dives down into the clear waters off the Indonesian island of Bali to pull away plastic from a ""reef star"" installed by her conservation group to encourage new coral growth. The Nusa Dua Foundation has installed almost 6,000 of the stars, hexagonal-shaped steel structures around a metre in diameter, in coral reefs across Bali. The stars bridge gaps in the reefs where coral has died, supporting regrowth. ""We're aiming to install about 5,000 reef stars over the next five years,"" Hutasoit, 52, a former World Wildlife Fund employee, told Reuters. ""And in the future, we also if possible want to expand outside Bali for the restoration of coral reefs."" The Indonesian archipelago harbours more than 75% of the world's coral species, many of which are facing erosion and bleaching every year, according to the Coral Triangle Initiative, a transnational coral restoration project. Only just over half of Bali's coral reefs are considered to be in ""good"" condition with 30% in ""poor"" condition and the remaining 15% in ""very poor"" condition, according to a 2018 report by Bali's Marine and Fisheries Department. The damage has been attributed to human activity, including destructive fishing, global warming, and heavy waves. Part of the Nusa Dua Foundation's remit is holding community outreach programs, attempting to educate local residents about the importance of protecting Bali's coral reefs. I Nyoman Sadnya, a local fisherman, said his parents had mined coral from the island's reefs for decades, unaware of the destructive long-term impact. ""My parents did not have a job and the area here used to be an arid area, and sometimes it was difficult to find food,"" he said. ""So my parents resorted to coral mining for building materials, because they didn't know (it was bad)."" Coral, popularly used for house foundations and decorative pieces, was a source of income for his parents. ""By looking at the condition of coral reefs today, we realise that what we did in the past to them was totally wrong,"" he said.

science,Jamming with the cicadas in New Jersey: a once in 17 years event," PRINCETON, New Jersey, June 3 (Reuters) - For some in the U.S., the emergence of billions of red-eyed cicadas this spring after a 17-year slumber has been met with annoyance - particularly over their loud buzzing calls. But for David Rothenberg, a professor of philosophy and music at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, it has presented a unique opportunity for collaboration. ""We're combining human musical ideas with nature's musical ideas,"" he explained as he gathered fellow musicians at a nature preserve in Princeton, New Jersey. As cicadas swarmed all around, Rothenberg - with his clarinet - and others on percussion and saxophone held an improvisational jam using the insects' trill as their guide. While it may seem like white noise to the uninitiated, Rothenberg said he could pluck out several distinct sounds produced by three species of cicada. The author of ""Bug Music"" said his fascination with nature sounds began as a child growing up in Connecticut. His interest is not limited to cicadas, he has also written jazz compositions accompanied by the calls of birds and humpback whales. ""Some people, of course, think I'm crazy, like it's just this gimmick,"" said Rothenberg. ""[But] it's serious stuff that nature has inspired humanity and all artforms more than anything else for centuries."" In the past, Rothenberg often played solo with the cicadas, but more recently he has tried to get others involved. ""The more you pay attention to nature is the only way we're going to save it without destroying it,"" he said. Guitarist Tim Blunk joked that the newly-hatched insects were the most cooperative musicians he has ever played with. ""They're never late. They always stay for the whole gig, and you don't have to pay them. It's like the ideal musical partner,"" he laughed. The cicadas, known as Brood X or Brood 10, began emerging from the earth last month in Washington, D.C. and 15 states, from Georgia to New York, and west to Indiana and Illinois. After they mate, a new crop of cicadas will start the 17-year process all over again: burrowing into the ground and not emerging again until 2038. In the meantime, Rothenberg is savoring his rare chance to jam with them. ""There's a lot of musicians who think that through improvisation you can reach places that you cannot reach any other way,"" he said. ""You can make something very special; it may never happen the same way again.""

science,NASA?�s Venus missions to probe divergent fate of Earth?�s hothouse sister planet," LOS ANGELES, June 2 (Reuters) - NASA announced plans on Wednesday to launch a pair of missions to Venus between 2028 and 2030 - its first in decades - to study the atmosphere and geologic features of Earth?�s so-called sister planet and better understand why the two emerged so differently. The U.S. space agency said it was awarding about $500 million each to develop the two missions, dubbed DAVINCI+ (short for Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble Gases, Chemistry and Imaging) and VERITAS (an acronym for Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography and Spectroscopy). DAVINCI+ will measure the composition of the dense, hothouse atmosphere of Venus to further understand how it evolved, while VERITAS will map the planet's surface from orbit to help determine its geologic history, NASA said. DAVINCI+, consisting of a fly-by spacecraft and an atmospheric descent probe, is also expected to return the first high-resolution images of unique geological characteristics on Venus called ""tesserae."" Scientists believe those features may be comparable to Earth's continents and suggest that Venus has plate tectonics, according to NASA's announcement. Earth's closest planetary cousin and the second planet from the sun, Venus is similar in structure but slightly smaller than Earth and much hotter. Above its forbidding landscape lies a thick, toxic atmosphere consisting primarily of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. The consequence is a runaway greenhouse effect that scorches the surface of Venus at temperatures as high as 880 degrees F (471 C), hot enough to melt lead. The ""air"" on Venus is so dense and pressurized that it behaves more like a fluid than a gas near the surface. Scientists believe Venus may once have harbored seas of water potentially suitable for life, before unknown forces triggered its extreme greenhouse effect, vaporizing its oceans. ""Venus is a 'Rosetta stone' for reading the record books of climate change, the evolution of habitability and what happens when a planet loses a long period of surface oceans,"" James Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. Venus has lately received less scientific attention than Mars, Earth's next-closest planetary neighbor, where NASA's roving astrobiology lab Perseverance landed in February. NASA's last dedicated mission to Venus, the Magellan spacecraft, reached the planet in 1990. After four years in orbit making the first global map of the Venusian surface and charting its gravity field, Magellan was sent plunging to the surface to gather atmospheric data before ceasing operations. The DAVINCI+ probe will ultimately meet a similar fate. After two fly-by passes to capture time-lapse imagery of Venus' clouds, DAVINCI+ will release its spherical probe for an hour-long descent to a vast mountainous region. Slowed first by a parachute, then by aerial friction, the probe will sample atmospheric chemistry, pressure and temperature all the way down, and take high-resolution images as it nears the surface. Even if it survives landing, the probe is expected to overheat within 20 minutes, Garvin said. Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,Electric-van startups race for a ?�golden ticket??order," LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - The future of a bevy of commercial electric van startups seeking investor capital through blank-check IPOs rests largely in the hands of a small group of big companies, above all UPS With each carrier having tens of thousands of vehicles in its global fleet, an order from a package delivery giant can launch a startup on the road to manufacturing scale and profitability, and serve as a marketing tool to win orders from other big customers. ""Everyone is looking for their golden ticket,"" said Steven Merkt, president of transportation solutions at sensor, connector and electronic component maker TE Connectivity Ltd Desperate to find the next Tesla But unlike Tesla, which enjoyed a headstart of years over traditional carmakers, commercial electric vehicle startups are racing against time as major manufacturers like Ford Motor Co Some startups already have their golden ticket. Arrival , which went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), has an order for up to 10,000 vans from UPS Others, like Xos, are close. Xos, which is going public via public through a merger with blank-check firm NextGen Acquisition Corp Some, like Canoo Inc Thore Meurer, European senior fleet director at Deutsche Post AG He said DHL has been talking to Britain's Arrival for years and will try out some of its test models. In the U.S. market, DHL has announced it will buy 89 electric vans from Lighting eMotors Meurer says DHL Express is also talking to two Asian startups about electric vans for Europe. But the company wants 14,000 electric vans in its European fleet by 2030 and is eager to get going. In April, DHL ordered 100 E-Ducato electric vans from Stellantis ""If another startup comes to market with a van two years from now, there will be no opportunity left for them,"" Meurer said. ""By then, every big player will have an electric van on the market."" ""CONFIDENCE GAP"" The Arrival electric test van decked out in UPS' distinct brown livery is popular with drivers at the package delivery giant's facility in London's Kentish Town district. During a demonstration of the van by Luke Wake, UPS vice president of maintenance and engineering, several drivers asked: ""When can we drive one?"" The Arrival van is the culmination of many years work by UPS to incorporate electric vehicles into its fleet. The Kentish Town depot is still home to some old former diesel trucks that UPS converted into electric vehicles. ""We converted hundreds of our pre-existing vehicles to electric to see how they fit in,"" Wake says, ""and to stimulate a market that didn't yet exist."" Working with a startup like Arrival The van's battery pack will allow UPS to add automatic doors for drivers and LED lights in the back to help drivers find packages more quickly. Such features can save seconds per delivery - which add up as UPS delivers 2 billion packages annually. The UPS order put Arrival on the map ""You always have a confidence gap to bridge,"" said Carl-Magnus Norden, founder of Stockholm-based Volta Trucks, which is developing an electric truck for inner-city deliveries to businesses and has an order for 1,000 trucks from French refrigerated truck firm Petit Forestier. ""So someone like Petit Forestier is important for us."" While most startups seek that golden ticket order, Electric Last Mile Inc (ELMS), which will go public via a merger with Forum Merger III Corp Chief Executive James Taylor said speed is paramount as giants like ELMS is betting it can make it because so far no one else plans to produce a van as small in the United States. ?�We have at least a short runway where we have no competition,??Taylor said.

science,Virus does not threaten U.S. blood supply; high vitamin D levels do not protect against COVID-19," June 2 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Coronavirus does not threaten U.S. blood supply Current guidelines for screening U.S. blood donors for symptoms of COVID-19 and for a history of recent infections are effectively protecting the blood supply from contamination with the new coronavirus, researchers say. In a study conducted for the National Institutes of Health, researchers tested nearly 18,000 ""minipools"" of blood samples ??that is, blood samples pooled from total of roughly 258,000 donors from across the country. Only three minipools contained genetic material from the virus, according to a report published in the journal Transfusion. In all three, the viral levels were low. In the one minipool that could be tested for infectivity, the virus material was noninfectious, the researchers said. ""Other studies have shown that in rare cases where a blood sample tested positive, transmission by blood transfusion has not occurred,"" coauthor Sonia Bakkour of the University of California, San Francisco, said in a statement. ""Therefore, it appears safe to receive blood as a transfusion recipient and to keep donating blood, without fear of transmitting COVID-19 as long as current screenings are used."" ( High vitamin D levels do not protect against COVID-19 Low levels of vitamin D have been tied to higher risks for COVID-19 and more severe illness, although no studies have proved that vitamin D deficiency is actually to blame. A study published on Tuesday in PLoS Medicine suggests that boosting vitamin D levels with supplements would not help. Researchers studied more than 1.2 million people of European ancestry from 11 countries, some of whom had genetic variants that result in naturally higher levels of vitamin D. People with these variants did not have a lower risk for coronavirus infection, hospitalization, or severe COVID-19, the researchers reported. Their results suggest that boosting vitamin D levels in deficient people probably would not help combat the coronavirus, and they do not believe randomized trials testing vitamin D supplementation would be worthwhile. Other experts, however, would still like to see such trials, especially in people of African and other non-European ancestries. ( Immune system workaround helps blood cancer patients with COVID-19 In blood cancer patients who lack antibody-producing cells, other immune cells can compensate to help fight the coronavirus, new research shows. People with blood cancers ??such as  leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma - often lack antibody-making immune cells called B cells, particularly after treatment with certain medications. Without enough B cells and antibodies, they are at risk for severe COVID-19. But other immune cells, called T cells, learn to recognize and attack the virus, according to a report published in Nature Medicine. Blood cancer patients in the study were more likely to die from COVID-19 than patients with solid tumors or without cancer. But among the blood cancer patients, those with higher levels of CD8 T cells were more than three times more likely to survive than those with lower levels of CD8 T cells. The authors speculate that CD8 T cell responses to COVID-19 vaccines might protect blood cancer patients even if they do not have typical antibody responses. ""This work can help us advise patients while we wait for more vaccine specific studies,"" said co-author Dr. Erin Bange of the University of Pennsylvania in a statement. While patients' vaccine response ""likely will not be as robust as their friends/family who don't have blood cancers, it is still ... potentially lifesaving,"" Bange added. ( In some long COVID cases, air gets trapped in lungs Some COVID-19 survivors with persistent breathing symptoms have a condition called ""air trapping,"" in which inhaled air gets stuck in the small airways of the lung and cannot be exhaled. Researchers studied 100 COVID-19 survivors who were still having respiratory problems, like coughs and shortness of breath, an average of more than two months after their diagnosis. Overall, 33 had been hospitalized, including 16 who had needed intensive care. The amount of lung area showing so-called ground-glass opacities on imaging studies ??a typical sign of lung damage from COVID-19 ??was higher in the hospitalized group than in those with milder disease, and it was even higher in patients who had required intensive care.  COVID-19 severity made little difference in the average percentage of lung affected by air trapping, however. It was 25.4% in patients not hospitalized, 34.5% in those who were hospitalized without intensive care, and 27.2% in patients who had been critically ill. By comparison, that proportion was 7.3% in a group of healthy volunteers. The air trapping was largely confined to patients' narrowest airway passages, according to a report posted on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. ""The long-term consequences"" of these patients' small airways disease ""are not known,"" the authors said. ( Open Our Standards: Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that Moderna Inc had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong."
science,China to launch high-stakes crewed mission to space," JIUQUAN, China, June 16 (Reuters) - China will send three astronauts into orbit on Thursday in a high-stakes mission, the first of four crewed space flights to complete the country?�s space station by the end of next year. China will launch Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo into orbit aboard the spacecraft Shenzhou-12 at 9:22 a.m. (0122 GMT) on June 17 from Jiuquan in northwestern Gansu province. Nie, 56, a former air force pilot, will be the oldest Chinese astronaut to go to space. Shenzhou-12, meaning ""Divine Vessel"", is the third of 11 missions needed to build China's space station. Construction began in April with the launch of Tianhe, the first and largest of three modules. The Shenzhou-12 crew are to live on the Tianhe, which means ""Harmony of the Heavens"", a cylinder 16.6 m (55 ft) long and 4.2 m (14 ft) in diameter. The three-month stay for Nie, Liu and Tang will be the longest for any Chinese astronauts, and one focus will be seeing how the men handle their relatively long time in orbit. ""The (mission) is longer this time, and not only do we have to set up the core module - this 'home' in space - we've to carry out a series of pivotal technical tests,"" Nie told reporters in Jiuquan. ""This mission is more arduous and the challenges are greater."" Shenzhou-12 will be Nie's third space outing, the second for Liu, 54, and the first for Tang, 45. On Liu's Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008, his first, he almost did not get to perform a space walk to plant the Chinese flag on the exterior of the spacecraft. Liu, with the help of another astronaut, used a crowbar to pry open the hatch after it refused to budge. ""We experienced some dangerous situations and encountered some difficulties on that mission,"" Liu said on Wednesday. ""The amount of time spent outside the cabin on this mission is much longer, and there will be many rounds of extra-vehicular activity. The mission has thus become extremely complex and tough."" BARRED FROM ISS Chinese astronauts have had a comparatively low international profile. U.S. legislation bars NASA from any cooperation with China, and Chinese astronauts have not been to the more than two-decade-old International Space Station (ISS), which has been visited by more than 240 men and women of various nationalities. The ISS may be decommissioned in 2024 if the project does not receive new funding, and China could end up being the operator of the only space station in Earth's orbit. ""After the completion of the Chinese space station, in the near future, we will see both Chinese and foreign astronauts jointly participate in the flight of the Chinese space station,"" said Ji Qiming, assistant director at the China Manned Space Agency, told reporters in Jiuquan. China?�s space launches drew intense international attention last month after remnants of the rocket that carried the Tianhe module into space ""We're willing to carry out more extensive international exchanges and cooperation with other countries on the issue of debris from spacecraft and in space,"" Ji said. Backup astronauts for the mission on Thursday are Zhai Zhigang, 54, Wang Yaping, 41 and Ye Guangfu, 40. China?�s last crewed flight mission was in 2016 when two men - Chen Dong and Jing Haipeng - were sent via the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft to Tiangong-2, a prototype of the space station where they later stayed for about a month.

science,EXCLUSIVE COVID-19 far more widespread in Indonesia than official data show: studies," JAKARTA, June 3 (Reuters) - COVID-19 is many times more prevalent in Indonesia than shown by official figures in the world's fourth most populous country, authors of two new studies told Reuters. The country of 270 million has recorded 1.83 million positive cases, but epidemiologists have long believed the true scale of the spread has been obscured by a lack of testing and contact tracing. The results of Indonesia's first major seroprevalence studies - which test for antibodies - were revealed exclusively to Reuters. One nationwide study between December and January suggested 15% of Indonesians had already contracted COVID-19 - when official figures at the end of January had recorded infections among only around 0.4% of people. Even now, Indonesia's total positive infections are only around 0.7% of the population. The results of the survey were not unexpected given under reporting, said Pandu Riono, a University of Indonesia epidemiologist who worked on the study carried out with help from the World Health Organisation. Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a senior health ministry official, said it was possible the study was preliminary, but there might be more cases than officially reported because many cases were asymptomatic. She said indonesia had low contact tracing and a lack of  laboratories to process tests. Based on blood tests, seroprevalence studies detect antibodies which show up people who likely already contracted the disease. The official figures are largely based on swab tests, which detect the virus itself and only reveal those who have it at the time. Antibodies develop one to three weeks after someone contracts the virus and stay in the body for months. WEAK TESTING Seroprevalence studies in other countries - including India - have also revealed more widespread infections. ""Our official surveillance system cannot detect COVID-19 cases. It is weak,"" said the principal investigator for the University of Indonesia study, Tri Yunis Miko Wahyono, who commented on it but was not authorised to confirm the figures. ""Contact tracing and testing in Indonesia is very poor and explains why so few cases are detected."" Fellow study author Pandu said that although the study showed the wider spread of the virus, Indonesia still appeared to be far from achieving herd immunity - making it a priority to speed up vaccination. Just 6% of Indonesia's targeted population of 181 million have been fully vaccinated with two doses so far, while 9.4% have had one shot, according to government data. Preliminary results of a separate seroprevalence study in Bali, done by the University of Udayana, found 17 per cent of those tested in September and November appeared to have been infected, principal investigator Anak Agung Sagung Sawitri told Reuters. That was 53 times higher than rate of infection based on the cases officially recorded at the time on the tourist island, which is planning to reopen to international visitors next month. The reopening is opposed by some public health experts, including academic and doctor Ady Wirawan. ""Testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine is very, very weak in Bali,"" he said. Our Standards: Asia-Pacific airlines have lost billions of dollars this year, with jets grounded in COVID-19 transportation freezes. Now, as some of the world's strictest pandemic-related travel rules begin to ease, they're ramping up flights and ticket offers."
science,Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft docks with China?�s space station module," SHENZHEN, China, May 29 (Reuters) - China?�s cargo spacecraft, carrying supplies, equipment and propellant, docked with the space station?�s key module Tianhe on Sunday, the official news agency Xinhua reported. The Tianzhou-2, or ""Heavenly Vessel"" in Chinese, autonomously rendezvoused and docked with Tianhe at 5:01 a.m. Beijing time, Xinhua said on Sunday. It blasted off via a Long March-7 Y3 rocket at 8:55 p.m. Beijing time on Saturday from the Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan, the China Manned Space Engineering Office said. With a designed life of more than 1 year, Tianzhou-2 carried supplies for future astronauts including food for the Shenzhou-12 crew which will be launched next month for a three-month stay on the station, as well as two tons of propellant. Tianzhou-2 is the second of 11 missions needed to complete China's first self-developed space station around 2022, and follows the launch of Tianhe, the first module, in late April. The three-module space station will rival the International Space Station (ISS), which is backed by countries including the United States, Russia and Japan. China was barred from participating in the ISS by the United States. The rocket's launch was postponed this month due to technical reasons, state media said. The first cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1 was sent to refuel a space lab - Tiangong-2 - three times in 2017, as a test of the technologies needed to support construction of the space station. Both Tiangong-2 and an earlier space lab Tiangong-1 have been deorbited in recent years. Next year, That rocket, capable of sending 25 tonnes of payload into low Earth orbit, was Media reports warned of an uncontrolled re-entry of the rocket's core stage, reviving memories of debris from the flight of the first Long March 5B in May 2020, which damaged buildings when it landed in Ivory Coast. Remnants from the rocket finally fell harmlessly in the Indian Ocean, but China drew criticism for not being transparent about the timing of the debris re-entry and predictions of its trajectory. From June until 2022, four manned spacecraft and four cargo spacecraft will also be launched, by the smaller Long March-7 and 2F rockets, which have a maximum low Earth payload of 14 tonnes and 8.8 tonnes, respectively.

science,India COVID-19 variant exhibits resistance; antibody drug shows promise," May 28 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. India variant shows resistance to antibody drugs, vaccines Antibody drugs and COVID-19 vaccines are less effective against a coronavirus variant that was first detected in India, according to researchers. The variant, known as B.1.617.2, has mutations that make it more transmissible. It is now predominant in some parts of India and has spread to many other countries. A multicenter team of scientists in France studied a B.1.617.2 variant isolated from a traveler returning from India. Compared to the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, the India variant was more resistant to antibody drugs, although three currently approved drugs still remained effective against it, they found. Antibodies in blood from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors and from people who received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were 3-fold to 6-fold less potent against the India variant than against the UK variant and a variant first identified in South Africa, according to a report posted on Thursday on the website bioRxiv ahead of peer review. The two-dose AstraZeneca vaccine, which does not protect against the South Africa variant, is likely to be ineffective against the India variant as well. Antibodies from people who had received their first dose ""barely inhibited"" this India variant, said study co-author Olivier Schwartz of Institut Pasteur. The study, Schwartz added, shows that the rapid spread of the India variant is associated with its ability to ""escape"" the effect of neutralizing antibodies. ( New antibody drug keeps mild COVID-19 from worsening An antibody drug from Vir Biotechnology Joint and muscle disease drugs may limit vaccine response The COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech Robust, coordinated immune response marks mild COVID-19 In COVID-19 patients who do not become seriously ill, the immune system reacts to the virus ""robustly,"" with a highly coordinated response, and this coordination may be one key to ensuring a mild illness, according to researchers. Detailed studies of immune system behavior in COVID-19 patients have focused primarily on those with moderate or severe illness and have found ""uncoordinated"" immune responses. The new study, posted Wednesday on the bioRxiv website ahead of peer review, ""used cutting-edge methods to deeply study immune cells"" in 18 patients with only mild illness, said study co-author Greg Szeto of the Allen Institute for Immunology in Seattle. In these mildly ill volunteers, the more intense the immune response in early infection, the higher the levels of antibodies in their blood after recovery, the multicenter research team found. And compared to participants who recovered, participants who had lingering troublesome symptoms - so-called Long Covid - had weaker immune responses to the virus in early infection, Szeto added. The differences the study found between mildly ill patients who did and did not develop Long Covid may help researchers devise more personalized ways to monitor immune responses to the virus and better methods for treatment, Szeto's team concluded. ( Open Our Standards: Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that Moderna Inc had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong."
science,New coral reef restoration technology aims to reverse climate change damage," May 27 (Reuters) - Marine scientist Deborah Brosnan remembers ?�feeling like a visitor at an amazing party??on her diving trips to a bay near the Caribbean island of Saint Barthelemy where she swam above coral reefs with nurse sharks, sea turtles and countless colorful fish. But on a return trip after Hurricane Irma ravaged the island in 2017, she dove the reef again - and was shocked by what she saw. ""Everything was dead,"" she recalled in an interview with Reuters. ""There were no sharks, no sea turtles, no sea grass, no living coral. I felt like I lost my friends."" Recent research has shown that warmer atmospheric temperatures and sea level rise contribute to more frequent, destructive tropical storms. Brosnan's experience helped spark a mission to create reef restoration technology. The project will span 1 hectare (2.6 acres) of dead reef off the coast of the Caribbean nation Antigua and Barbuda. The project, known as Ocean-Shot, was announced Thursday at the Global Citizen's Forum. The technology, funded by U.S. entrepreneur John Paul DeJoria, the co-founder of Paul Mitchell hair products, mimics the design and shape of natural reefs to provide opportunities for colonization by corals and other marine life. The built reef modules will also help protect the nearby coastal community from storm surge and sea level rise, project officials said. Brosnan, whose Washington-based company is leading the efforts, said scientists will test new technologies aimed at speeding up coral growth, which naturally takes up to a decade to restore 1 hectare. A nearby coral nursery will also grow several species that will eventually help populate the reef replacement. Ocean-Shot launches at a crucial time. Scientists estimate up to half the world's coral reefs have already been lost and the rest are at risk. From the Caribbean to the western Pacific, the effects of climate change have led to coral bleaching, a worrying uptick in ocean acidification and relentless hurricanes that have wreaked havoc on the world's reefs, Brosnan said. It has been a challenge, too, to draw attention to the plight of coral reef. ""A lot of people don't fully appreciate the state of the ocean because they don't see it,"" Brosnan said. Coral reefs support more than 25% of marine biodiversity, including turtles, fish and lobsters, which fuel global fishing industries. The reef is like an apartment building, Brosnan said, with different species living on each floor from the basement to the penthouse. Serving as protective barriers for coastal communities against wave action, the coral reefs enable people to set up homes and businesses closer to the ocean. Coral reefs mitigate sand flow to beaches, replenishing the sparkling white beaches that make the Caribbean a global tourist hot spot. The sand itself is thanks to coral and a very important local species that feeds on it. ""The white sandy beach on a tropical island is actually parrotfish poop,"" Brosnan said. If the world's remaining reefs continue to die, Brosnan predicts a major financial impact on fishing and tourism that island nations rely upon, which could fuel migration to more developed countries. ""It's a real concern as to where you can live if the coral reef disappears, how you can make a living if the fisheries are gone and where you have to move now,"" she said. After the project?�s implementation in Antigua and Barbuda, officials hope to replicate Ocean-Shot in other locations in the Caribbean and Latin America, Brosnan said, adding there could be scope to bring it to other regions. Our Standards: China said representatives from more than 100 countries have adopted the ""Kunming Declaration"" which calls for ""urgent and integrated action"" in creating a new global biodiversity pact."
science,Prehistoric cemetery in Sudan shows war has been hell forever," WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - All was not well among the peoples who inhabited the east bank of the Nile River in northern Sudan some 13,400 years ago, as revealed by the battered bodies buried in a cemetery at one of the world's oldest sites showing human warfare. Researchers said on Thursday a re-examination of remains from the Jebel Sahaba cemetery excavated in the 1960s provides new insight into this prehistoric bloodshed, including evidence that there had been a succession of violent encounters rather than a single deadly showdown as previously believed. Of the skeletal remains of 61 men, women and children, 41 bore signs of at least one injury, mainly from projectile weapons including spears and arrows. Some wounds had healed, indicating the person survived the fighting. Sixteen of them had both healed and unhealed wounds, indicating they survived one fight only to die in another. A microscopic examination identified wounds with remnants of stone weapons embedded in the bone. The original 1960s analysis had identified only 20 people with any wounds and none with healed injuries. The extensive and indiscriminate violence affected men and women equally, with children as young as 4 also wounded, said paleoanthropologist Isabelle Crevecoeur of the French National Centre for Scientific Research at the University of Bordeaux, lead author of the ""It appears that one of the main lethal properties sought was to slash and cause blood loss,"" Crevecoeur said. While spears and arrows can be delivered from a distance, there also was evidence of close combat with numerous instances of parry fractures - blows to the forearm sustained when the arm is raised to protect the head - and broken hand bones. Hunter-gatherers lived in the Nile Valley at the time, before the advent of agriculture. They hunted mammals such as antelope, caught fish and collected plants and roots. Their groups were small, perhaps not exceeding a hundred. While it is difficult to know why they fought, it came during a time of climate change in the region from a dry period to a wetter one along with severe Nile flooding episodes, possibly triggering competition among rival clans for resources and territory. ""Unlike a specific battle or short war, violence appears to have unfortunately been a regular occurrence and part of the daily fabric of their lives,"" said study co-author Daniel Antoine, acting head of the Department of Egypt and Sudan and curator of bioarchaeology at the British Museum in London. Crevecoeur said the archeological evidence indicated ""recurrent, small-scale clashes probably in the form of raids, skirmishes, ambush attacks among hunter-gatherer groups, rather than one single conflict."" Unknown cultural differences between groups also could have been at play, Crevecoeur added. The site, now submerged under the large human-made reservoir called Lake Nasser, is the Nile Valley's earliest-known funerary complex and one of Africa's oldest. The human remains have been stored at the British Museum. Philosophers long have pondered the contradictions of human nature. Our species has forged magnificent intellectual, technological and artistic achievements and has engaged in ghastly warfare. Archeological evidence has shown interpersonal violence in the ""We believe our findings have important implications to the debate about the causes and form of warfare,"" Crevecoeur said. ""What is certain is that acts of violence are recorded since hundreds of thousands of years ago, and are not restricted to our species - for example, Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,Explainer: Tesla drops radar; is Autopilot system safe?," June 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Tesla aims to make the driver-assist system fully self-driving, and many in that young industry are skeptical that a vision-only system will work, saying such systems face challenges in darkness, sunny glare and poor weather conditions. Safety ratings groups have dropped their labels until they test newly configured cars. Still, Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has surprised the industry before - first and foremost by turning the electric vehicle maker into the world's most valuable car company. Here are some questions and answers about Tesla's bet on a camera-based system. HOW DOES TESLA'S SYSTEM WORK, WITH AND WITHOUT RADAR? Tesla in May started delivering Model 3 and Model Y with a driver-assist system based on eight cameras mounted around the car and with no radar. The cameras, like eyes, send images to computer networks, like the brain, which recognize and analyse objects. Over the years, Tesla's view of radar has changed. In May 2016, a Tesla car crashed, killing the driver, when Autopilot failed to detect a white semi-truck crossing in front of it. Later that year, Tesla announced a plan to give radar a primary role in navigation while describing a false-alarm problem with some radar systems that needed to be fixed. ""Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar ... it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust,"" Musk tweeted in 2016. Tesla also said radar ""plays an essential role in detecting and responding to forward objects."" Tesla does not use a more expensive lidar sensor, which gives more precise shape information of an object than radar. Tesla drivers complained of ""phantom braking"" when their cars stopped abruptly on highways under an overpass or a bridge. Musk said the new camera-only system will likely be safer than radar because of less ""noise"" or confusing signals, industry news site Electrek reported. After the May 2016 crash, Tesla had similar accidents of cars crashing into semi-trucks and stationary police cars and fire trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is currently investigating 24 accidents involving Tesla cars. HOW DO OTHER SELF-DRIVING TECHNOLOGIES WORK? Most automakers and self-driving vehicle companies such as Alphabet Inc's Radar systems, like cameras, are relatively inexpensive. They work in poor weather but lack resolution to accurately determine the shape of objects. Lidar has higher resolution, but is vulnerable to weather conditions. ""You need to use all the different kinds of sensors and then combine them,"" said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, reflecting a common industry view. Tesla's camera-centric system is ""much harder to design, but it is also much cheaper"" than Waymo's laser-based lidar approach, enabling the electric car maker to scale up and further improve its technology, Tesla's artificial intelligence  director, Andrej Karpathy, said in a ?�Robot Brains??podcast in March. WHAT DOES TESLA LOSE BY GIVING UP RADAR? There is a lot of debate on this issue. The loss of radar degrades driver-support features enough ""to render them less usable to unusable in adverse weather conditions,"" Steven Shladover, a research engineer at Berkeley University of California. ""It makes no sense whatsoever technologically - only a way of reducing cost of components,"" he said. Since radar is good at measuring distances accurately, its loss could affect emergency braking to avoid collisions with slowed vehicles, said Ram Machness, chief business officer of advanced radar maker Arbe Robotics. ""If you drop radar without proving vision alone does that job as well, then you're compromising safety,"" Telanon, a developer of a driver support system, said on Twitter. Tesla said some driver-assistant features including its ability to maintain speed at the pace of the car ahead may be temporarily limited or inactive upon delivery. It said it would start restoring the features via software updates in the weeks ahead. Musk told Electrek that the vision system had improved so much that it was better off without radar. Last week, NHTSA withdrew its advanced safety features label for new Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and Consumer Reports dropped its ""top pick"" label. Both intend to test the vision-only system. WHO KNOWS BEST? Tesla's plan runs counter to most of the self-driving industry, but it is difficult to say who is right. No company has yet deployed a fully functional self-driving system in scale, and the entire industry is years behind initial projections. Our Standards: Tesla Inc has agreed to lease office space from HP Inc near the electric carmaker's current headquarters in Palo Alto, California, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters."
science,Post vaccination infection rare but possibly contagious; study refutes another anti-vax pregnancy claim," May 26 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Breakthrough infections rare, but potentially contagious As of April 30, when roughly 101 million Americans had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, ""breakthrough"" infections had been reported in 0.01% of them, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Tuesday. Roughly 27% of breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, while in 2% of cases, patients died. The CDC had genetic data for virus samples from 555 breakthrough infections. Mutated variants of the coronavirus, including those first seen in the UK and South Africa, accounted for 64% of the breakthroughs. In a separate study posted Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, researchers reported that among 20 fully-vaccinated healthcare workers with breakthrough COVID-19 cases, all were infected with variants. An earlier study had linked breakthrough infections with low viral loads, suggesting low transmission risks, but ""we found many samples in our breakthrough cohort with high viral load,"" said coauthor Pavitra Roychoudhury of the University of Washington. ""Our work suggests that not all breakthrough infections are at low risk of initiating transmission and, if they did, these infections could lead to the continued spread of variants of concern, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates."" ( Study refutes anti-vaxxers' pregnancy, breast milk claims Unfounded claims by anti-vaccine activists that COVID-19 shots from Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccines appear safe for ""long COVID"" survivors COVID-19 survivors with lingering symptoms can safely be vaccinated against the coronavirus, a small study suggests. Researchers tracked 36 individuals with ""long COVID"" who had been hospitalized while acutely ill and who later received at least one dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or AstraZeneca Moderna says vaccine safe, effective in adolescents Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine was 100% effective in a trial involving 3,732 adolescents aged 12-17, with no major safety problems, the company said on Tuesday. Among participants who received two doses, there were no cases of COVID-19 compared with four cases among those who received a placebo. After only one dose, the vaccine was 93% effective in this age group, Moderna said. Side effects were similar to those reported in earlier studies, including headache, fatigue, body aches and chills. Moderna plans to submit the findings to regulators for emergency use authorization in June. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday it is monitoring rare reports of mild heart inflammation after COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents. The CDC said the condition is not occurring at higher rates than would be expected in the general population, so no causal link to the vaccine has been established. Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said even if vaccines turn out to be the cause, it is important to consider the risk-benefit ratio. ""Vaccines are going to unequivocally be much more beneficial,"" outweighing any low risk of myocarditis, he said. ( Open Our Standards: Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that Moderna Inc had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong."
science,Super Flower Moon rises in clear sky over Sydney Opera House," SYDNEY, May 26 (Reuters) - The year?�s biggest full moon, known as the Super Flower Moon, rose in a clear evening sky over the Sydney Opera House on Wednesday to the delight of amateur photographers positioned just across the water to capture the moment. The moon was at the closest point to Earth in its orbit, making it appear about 7% larger and 15% brighter than normal. The May full moon is known as the Flower Moon as it occurs when spring flowers are in bloom. This Super Flower Moon will also feature the first total lunar eclipse in more than two years, during which the moon will pass through the Earth's shadow. It will appear red, which is known as a blood moon, because light is scattered through the Earth's atmosphere, much like during a sunset. The eclipse will be seen in Sydney when the moon is much higher in the sky. The eclipse was due to take place in the early morning hours in western North America, with people in Alaska and Hawaii poised to get the best views. It will also be visible in southern Chile and Argentina. Stargazers in all of Australia and in New Zealand and parts of Southeast Asia will be able to see the eclipse on Wednesday evening.

science,"U.S firms GM, Lockheed aim for the moon with lunar rover venture"," DETROIT, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. firms General Motors (GM) GM and Lockheed said they would collaborate to make a battery-powered, autonomous Lunar Terrain Vehicle for NASA's Artemis lunar landing program, which aims to return U.S. astronauts to the moon as early as 2024. NASA is expected to launch a competition to develop lunar vehicles in its Artemis moon landing program. The agency has outlined plans for a variety of lunar vehicles that can carry human explorers, haul commercial payloads or traverse remote regions of the moon on missions lasting as long as 100 days. Elon Musk's rocket launch company, SpaceX, won a $2.9 billion contract last month to build the spacecraft to carry NASA astronauts to the moon. That award is being challenged by Jeff Bezos' BlueOrigin and defense contractor Dynetics Inc. Lockheed and GM have a history in space. Lockheed has worked on NASA space projects for 50 years and GM helped develop the original NASA lunar rover, which ferried NASA astronauts on the surface of the moon in the early 1970s. For GM, getting back into the space business offers a fresh way to compete with Musk's Tesla Inc Musk has used SpaceX to promote Tesla's electric vehicles, including launching a Tesla Roadster into deep space. Lockheed and GM said their proposed lunar vehicle would use GM battery technology to travel ""significantly farther distances"" than the Apollo mission vehicles, which ventured just 4.7 miles from the landers. One goal for the new vehicle is to allow for exploration of the Moon's dark, rugged south pole, and other areas humans have not gone before, GM and Lockheed said. GM and Lockheed said their vehicle would be designed to provide ""commercial payload services"" and prepare for human landings.

science,Immune system has long-term defenses after mild COVID-19; children may be key carriers of virus variants," May 24 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Immune system may never forget mild COVID-19 Months after recovery from mild COVID-19, when antibody levels in the blood have declined, immune cells in bone marrow remain ready to pump out new antibodies against the coronavirus, researchers reported on Monday in Nature. Upon infection, short-lived immune cells are generated quickly to secrete an early wave of protective antibodies. As the immune cells die out, antibody levels decline. But a pool of these immune cells, called long-lived plasma cells, is held in reserve after infection. Most of them migrate to the bone marrow, explained coauthor Ali Ellebedy of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. His team obtained bone marrow samples from 19 patients seven months after the onset of mild COVID-19. Fifteen had long-lived plasma cells secreting antibodies against the coronavirus. Five of the 15 had second bone marrow biopsies 11 months after symptom onset and all still had long-lived plasma cells secreting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Ellebedy, in a statement, noted that these cells are ""just sitting in the bone marrow and secreting antibodies. They have been doing that ever since the infection resolved, and they will continue doing that indefinitely... These cells will live and produce antibodies for the rest of people's lives."" It is not clear yet whether the same results would be seen in survivors of moderate to severe COVID-19, the authors said. ( Coronavirus variants seen more often in young U.S. children Young children appear to be significant carriers of more contagious variants of the new coronavirus, such as the ones identified in the UK and in California, according to a new U.S. study. From March 2020 to April 2021, researchers at nine children's hospitals tested a total of 2,119 COVID-19 patients age 18 or younger for so-called variants of concern, along with key mutations that help the variants become more contagious or hide from the patient's immune system. ""In total, we identified 560 of these important mutations, and 75% (420/560) ... were in children less than 12 years of age, the population that is currently not eligible for COVID-19 vaccines,"" said Jennifer Dien Bard of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, lead author of a report posted on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The results provide ""clear evidence"" of the emergence of variants of concern in pediatric patients across diverse geographies and socioeconomic populations in the United States, the researchers said in their paper. They added that the results highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of pediatric populations ""who will be among the last groups to receive vaccination and who are key to ending this pandemic."" (https://bit.ly/2RBJNWO) Dentures may harbor more bacteria during COVID-19 Denture wearers infected with the coronavirus may be more likely to harbor bacteria that increase their risk for additional infections on top of COVID-19, a small study suggests. Researchers analyzed removable dentures from 30 patients with COVID-19 and 30 healthy individuals. Swabbing the surface of the dentures yielded Streptococcus species in 93.3% of COVID-19 patients versus 40% of healthy volunteers, and Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria in 46.7% of COVID-19 patients versus 13.4% of the other group. All of these microorganisms are seen as potentially important causes of additional bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients that could lead to or worsen problems such as respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia, the researchers reported on Friday in The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry. They recommend that dental prostheses in COVID-19 patients be tested and that appropriate medications be used to prevent the invasion of bacteria in vulnerable individuals.

science,China says Martian rover takes first drive on surface of Red Planet," BEIJING, May 22 (Reuters) - A remote-controlled Chinese motorised rover drove down the ramp of its landing capsule on Saturday and onto the surface of Mars, making China the first nation to orbit, land and deploy a land vehicle on its inaugural mission to the Red Planet. Zhurong, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, drove down to the surface of Mars at 10:40 a.m. Beijing time (0240 GMT), according to the rover's official Chinese social media account. China this month joined the United States as the only nations to deploy land vehicles on Mars. The former Soviet Union landed a craft in 1971, but it lost communication seconds later. The 240-kg (530-pound) Zhurong, which has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera, will study the planet's surface soil and atmosphere. Powered by solar energy, Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any subsurface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar during its 90-day exploration of the Martian surface. Zhurong will move and stop in slow intervals, with each interval estimated to be just 10 metres (33 feet) over three days, according to the official China Space News. ""The slow progress of the rover was due to the limited understanding of the Martian environment, so a relatively conservative working mode was specially designed,"" Jia Yang, an engineer involved in the mission, told China Space News. Jia said he would not rule out a faster pace in the later stage of the rover's mission, depending on its operational state at the time. Jia said the rover was designed to be highly autonomous because the distance to Mars, at 320 million km (200 million miles), means a signal takes 40 minutes to travel both ways, posing a hurdle for real-time control of the rover. Martian temperatures are also a problem, he said: a nighttime drop to minus 130 degrees Celsius (minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit)freezes carbon dioxide, covering the uneven ground with a layer of dry ice - a terrain risk for the rover. Zhurong has an automated suspension system that can lift and lower its chassis by 60 centimetres (2 feet), the only rover with such a capability, according to China Space News. The rover is covered by nano-aerogel plates to protect its body from the cold. Dust storms could also affect the rover's ability to generate power through its solar panels, Jia said. To overcome this, the panel surface is made with a material that cannot be easily stained by dust and can easily shake dust off by vibration, he said. ANCIENT OCEAN China's uncrewed Tianwen-1 spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year.

science,Virgin Galactic moves one step closer to commercial space flights," May 22 (Reuters) - Flying at Mach 3 and reaching more than 55 miles above the Earth Saturday, British billionaire Sir Richard Branson's private spaceship company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc This is a milestone in Branson's near two-decades effort to create a commercial ""spaceline"" to take paying customers into outer space. Touted as the first human spaceflight from the state, Branson's SpaceShipTwo craft lifted off in the desert about 45 miles northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, about 10:35 a.m. About 50 minutes later, traveling at more than 2,300 miles an hour, it reached a height NASA recognizes as space and attained suborbital flight status. ""Welcome to space"" the company posted on Twitter. Branson shared videos of the flight on social media and said on Twitter, ""Delighted to be on the flightline to Virgin Galactic's first human spaceflight from the majestic Spaceport America."" On the flight deck were CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay who reached space, while Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci piloted a carrier plane that helped the craft lift off, the company said. The space plane, which can hold six passengers, glided to a landing on a runway safely with its two pilots about 11:45 a.m. ""The crew experienced extraordinary views of the bright, blue-rimmed curvature of the earth against the blackness of space ...

science,DNA study seeks to end dispute on where Columbus was born," MADRID, May 19 (Reuters) - Spanish researchers set out on Wednesday to settle the dispute over the true origins of Christopher Columbus after various theories in the past decades claimed the explorer hailed from Portugal or Spain, rather than Italy, as most scholars agree. ""There is no doubt on our part (about his Italian origin), but we can provide objective data that can ... close a series of existing theories,"" Jose Antonio Lorente, lead scientist of the DNA study at the University of Granada, told a video news conference. Historians believe Columbus was born in Genoa in 1451. The university hosted a meeting of proponents of alternative theories about Columbus' birthplace, that include Spain's Valencia, Espinosa de Henares, Galicia and Mallorca, Portugal's Alentejo region and a few other places. ""I hope (with this research) we will come to the conclusion that unites us in our common objective, which is to demonstrate that Columbus was a Spanish nobleman and not a Genoese sailor,"" said Alfonso Sanz, an amateur history researcher and author, who says Columbus was born in Espinosa de Henares in central Spain. The results of the final stage of DNA research on tiny samples of what scientists believe are the remains of Columbus, his son Fernando and his brother Diego, will be analysed independently by laboratories in Europe and the Americas, and should be published in October. The first samples were collected in 2004-2005 and the DNA analysis will now resume after a 16-year hiatus due to technology challenges, which meant too much of the precious sample material would be wasted in exchange for too little data. ""Our team agreed on an ethical approach ... wait for a technological development that has now happened,"" said Lorente.

science,How to watch the upcoming 'Super Flower Blood Moon' eclipse," May 25 (Reuters) - The full moon on Wednesday will be the year's biggest ""supermoon"" and feature the first total lunar eclipse in more than two years. During the eclipse, the full moon will pass through the Earth's shadow. It appears red, known as a ""blood moon"", as light is scattered through the Earth's atmosphere, much like during a sunset. In addition, the moon will be at perigee, or the closest point to Earth in its orbit, making it appear about 7% larger than normal and 15% brighter or a ""super moon,"" according to astronomers. May's full moon is known as the ""Flower Moon"" since it occurs when spring flowers are in bloom. The result when taken together is a ""Super Flower Blood Moon."" The eclipse will happen in the early morning hours on Wednesday in western North America, with people in Alaska and Hawaii getting the best views. It can also be seen in southern Chile and Argentina. Skygazers in all of Australia and New Zealand and parts of Southeast Asia can see the eclipse on Wednesday evening. For stargazers in parts of the world where the event is not visible or obscured by clouds, some observatories will webcast the eclipse. The The peak viewing time for the eclipse will be between 4:11 a.m. and 4:26 a.m. PT on the U.S. West Coast or 9:11 p.m. to 9:26 p.m. AEST in Australia (1111 GMT to 1126 GMT), according to the observatories.

science,New species of crested dinosaur identified in Mexico," MEXICO CITY, May 13 (Reuters) - A team of palaeontologists in Mexico have identified a new species of dinosaur after finding its 72 million-year-old fossilized remains almost a decade ago, Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) said on Thursday. The new species, named Tlatolophus galorum, was identified as a crested dinosaur after 80% of its skull was recovered, allowing experts to compare it to other dinosaurs of that type, INAH said. The investigation, which also included specialists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, began in 2013 with the discovery of an articulated tail in the north-central Mexican state of Coahuila, where other discoveries have been made. ""Once we recovered the tail, we continued digging below where it was located. The surprise was that we began to find bones such as the femur, the scapula and other elements,"" said Alejandro Ramírez, a scientist involved in the discovery. Later, the scientists were able to collect, clean and analyze other bone fragments from the front part of the dinosaur's body. The palaeontologists had in their possession the crest of the dinosaur, which was 1.32 meters long, as well as other parts of the skull: lower and upper jaws, palate and even a part known as the neurocranium, where the brain was housed, INAH said. The Mexican anthropology body also explained the meaning of the name - Tlatolophus galorum - for the new species of dinosaur. Tlatolophus is a mixture of two words, putting together a term from the indigenous Mexican language of Nahuatl that means ""word"" with the Greek term meaning ""crest"". Galorum refers to the people linked to the research, INAH said.

science,China completes historic Mars spacecraft landing," BEIJING, May 15 (Reuters) - An uncrewed Chinese spacecraft successfully landed on the surface of Mars on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua reported, making China the second space-faring nation after the United States to land on the Red Planet. The Tianwen-1 spacecraft landed on a site on a vast plain known as Utopia Planitia, ""leaving a Chinese footprint on Mars for the first time,"" Xinhua said. Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a message of congratulations to all the people involved in the mission. ""You were brave enough for the challenge, pursued excellence and placed our country in the advanced ranks of planetary exploration,"" he said. ""Your outstanding achievement will forever be etched in the memories of the motherland and the people."" The craft left its parked orbit at about 1700 GMT Friday (0100 Beijing time Saturday). The landing module separated from the orbiter three hours later and entered the Martian atmosphere, the official China Space News said. It said the landing process consisted of ""nine minutes of terror"" as the module decelerates and then slowly descends. The official landing time was 2318 GMT (0718 Beijing time), Xinhua said, citing the China National Space Administration. The rover took more than 17 minutes to unfold its solar panels and antenna and send signals to ground controllers more than 320 million kilometres away. The rover, named Zhurong, will now survey the landing site before departing from its platform to conduct inspections. Named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, Zhurong has six scientific instruments including a high-resolution topography camera. It will study the planet's surface soil and atmosphere. Zhurong will also look for signs of ancient life, including any sub-surface water and ice, using a ground-penetrating radar. Tianwen-1, or ""Questions to Heaven"", after a Chinese poem written two millennia ago, is China's first independent mission to Mars. A probe co-launched with Russia in 2011 failed to leave the Earth's orbit. The five-tonne spacecraft blasted off from the southern Chinese island of Hainan in July last year, launched by the powerful Long March 5 rocket. After more than six months in transit, Tianwen-1 reached the Red Planet in February where it had been in orbit since. If Zhurong is successfully deployed, China would be the first country to orbit, land and release a rover in its maiden mission to Mars. Tianwen-1 was one of three that reached Mars in February, with U.S. rover Hope - the third spacecraft that arrived at Mars in February this year - is not designed to make a landing. Launched by the United Arab Emirates, it is currently orbiting above Mars gathering data on its weather and atmosphere. The first successful landing ever was made by NASA's Viking 1 in July 1976 and then by Viking 2 in September that year. A Mars probe launched by the former Soviet Union landed in December 1971, but communication was lost seconds after landing.

science,Delayed 2nd Pfizer/BioNTech shot boosts antibodies in elderly; COVID-19 obesity risk higher for men," May 14 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Delaying second Pfizer/BioNTech dose boosts antibodies in elderly Delaying the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Impact of obesity on COVID-19 risks may be greater in men The known increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death linked to obesity may be even more pronounced for men than women, new data suggest. Researchers studied 3,530 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with an average age of 65, including 1,469 who were obese. In men, moderate obesity was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing severe disease, needing mechanical breathing assistance and dying from COVID-19. (The threshold for moderate obesity is a body mass index (BMI) of 35. In an 5-foot, five-inch tall (1.65 m) adult, that would correspond to a weight of 210 pounds (95 kg). In women, however, only a BMI of 40 or higher, indicating severe obesity, was linked with the increased risks. In a report published in European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, the researchers note that while obesity is known to be linked with body-wide inflammation, patients' levels of inflammatory proteins did not appear to explain the association between obesity and severe illness. For now, they conclude, ""particular attention should be paid"" to protecting patients with obesity from the coronavirus, ""with priority to vaccination access, remote work, telemedicine, and other measures given the higher risk of adverse outcomes once they are diagnosed with COVID-19."" ( COVID-19 testing rates low among symptomatic Americans Sick Americans appear to be passing up opportunities to get tested for coronavirus and thus are likely unknowingly spreading the infection throughout their communities, new research shows. Among 37,000 adults across the United States who participated in a smartphone app survey between March and October 2020, nearly 2,700 reported at least one episode of fever and chills. But according to a report published in JAMA Network Open, only a small fraction reported receiving a COVID-19 test result within seven days of the onset of illness. At first, as tests became more accessible, the numbers improved. In early April 2020, less than 10% of survey participants reporting illness with fever received test results within a week. By late July, that proportion had increased to 24.1%. Throughout the summer and fall, as tests became easier to find, the number of sick participants who reported getting tested remained flat. By late October, only 26% reported receiving a test result within a week of febrile illness. ""It's shocking to me that when people have a fever they're still not getting tested,"" said coauthor Dr. Mark Pletcher of the University of California, San Francisco. ""Tests are easy to come by. People might have coronavirus, might be spreading it to their friends and neighbors, and they're not getting tested.""

science,"For deep-diving elephant seals, it takes lots of work to stay fat"," May 13 (Reuters) - For elephant seals - one of the most distinctive of the 33 species that comprise the world's seal family - it is hard work to stay fat. Scientists have conducted the most thorough study to date of the unique feeding behavior of northern elephant seals, focusing on the females of the species during arduous two-month post-breeding migrations in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The seals were found to spend upwards of 20 hours every day - and sometimes a full 24 hours - in continuous deep-diving to feed on multitudes of small fish, rather than the larger prey favored by other deep-diving marine mammals, to gain the body fat essential for successful reproduction and insulation in the frigid depths. They fed 1,000 to 2,000 times daily. ""It is not easy to get fat,"" said marine biologist Taiki Adachi of the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who led the study published this week in the journal Science Advances. The researchers tracked 48 female elephant seals from Año Nuevo State Park in California, site of an important breeding colony, as they covered vast ocean distances. Their round-trip migration was up to around 3,700 miles (6,000 km). They based their findings on data obtained from 2011 and 2018 using three small removable devices: one attached under the jaw that counted the number of times they fed and measured their depth; a satellite tracker attached atop the head that provided location information; and a ""smart"" video camera with an infra-red LED light flash, motion tracker and another depth sensor, also atop the head. Elephant seals get their name from the prominent noses of the males that resemble an elephant's trunk. There are two species - the northern elephant seal and the slightly larger southern elephant seal. The two are the world's biggest seals and the largest marine mammals other than whales. Male northern elephant seals may reach 13 feet long (4 meters) and weigh up to 4,500 pounds (2,000 kg). Females are substantially smaller, getting up to about 10 feet (3 meters) in length and 1,300 pounds (590 kg). The males feed only in coastal waters. Some large marine mammals rely upon deep dives to forage for meals, with more food needed based on the animal's size. Sperm whales, perhaps the heavyweight champions of the deep dive, hunt for large prey like giant squid. The female elephant seals, also large but not on the scale of a sperm whale, have devised a different solution - eating huge amounts of small fish. But it is laborious to catch enough small fish to meet the energy needs of such a large animal. ""They continuously dive, for long periods of time - 20 minutes on average and about 100 minutes at maximum - and deep -  500 meters (1,640 feet) on average and about 1,500 meters (4,920 feet) at maximum - with only a few minutes breathing at the surface,"" Adachi said. ""During the two-month migration, they never come back to the land. The sleeping hours in at-sea animals is not fully understood. But, based on our record of extreme foraging, their available time for sleeping should be less than 20% of the day,"" Adachi added. The range of the northern elephant seal spans the Pacific coast of the United States, Canada and Mexico. They generally breed and give birth in California and Baja California, usually on offshore islands, from December to March, and fast during mating season, losing perhaps a third of their body weight. Our Standards: China said representatives from more than 100 countries have adopted the ""Kunming Declaration"" which calls for ""urgent and integrated action"" in creating a new global biodiversity pact."
science,Child's burial site tells of early man's emotional life - Kenyan archaeologist," NAIROBI, May 12 (Reuters) - The discovery of the oldest known human burial site, a child's grave in a Kenyan cave, sheds new light on the emotional life of early Homo sapiens, the head of archaeology for the east African country's museums said on Wednesday. Scientists announced last week that they had found the site, dating to around 78,000 years ago, where a youngster they have nicknamed 'Mtoto' or 'child' in Swahili was buried in a cave called Panga ya Saidi near the Kenyan coast. ""It's significant ... because it's for the first time that we're beginning to get a feel of the cognitive and also the emotional abilities at this point in time,"" Emmanuel Ndiema told Reuters in an interview. Previous archaeological discoveries helped researchers understand other aspects of how early humans lived, such as their technological advances, how they sustained themselves and how they related to their environment, he said. ""We are beginning to understand people having some emotional attachment to the dead that they can be able to intentionally bury them. We are also seeing cognitive abilities, abstract thinking,"" said Ndiema. Mtoto was placed in a shallow grave under the sheltered overhang of the cave, head resting on a pillow and the upper part of the body carefully wrapped in a shroud. The child, whose gender remains unclear, is thought to have died aged about 2-1/2 to 3 years old. The body was placed in a flexed position, lying on the right side, with knees drawn toward the chest, according to the researchers who published their findings last week. Mtoto was part of a hunter-gatherer culture, with remains of various antelope species and other prey found at the site, an upland setting in a tropical forest. Also found were stone tools for scraping and boring holes, and stone points that could be used as part of a spear. Ndiema said the discovery also shows early Homo sapiens lived in different parts of what is now Kenya, contradicting a long-standing narrative that suggested early humans only settled in the Great Rift Valley, further west from the coastal area.

science,Faraway NASA probe detects the eerie hum of interstellar space," WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The classic 1979 sci-fi horror film ""Alien"" was advertised with the memorable tagline, ""In space no can hear you scream."" It did not say anything about humming. Instruments aboard NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, which nine years ago exited our solar system's outer reaches, have detected a faint monotonous hum caused by the constant vibrations of the small amounts of gas found in the near-emptiness of interstellar space, scientists said. It essentially represents the background noise present in the vast expanse between star systems. These vibrations, called persistent plasma waves, were identified at radio frequencies in a narrow bandwidth during a three-year period as Voyager 1 traverses interstellar space. ""The persistent plasma waves that we've just discovered are far too weak to actually hear with the human ear. If we could hear it, it would sound like a single steady note, playing constantly but changing very slightly over time,"" said Stella Koch Ocker, a Cornell University doctoral student in astronomy and lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature Astronomy. The Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in September 1977, is currently located about 14.1 billion miles (22.7 billion km) from Earth - roughly 152 times the distance between our planet and the sun - and is still obtaining and transmitting data. Having decades ago visited the huge planets Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 is now providing insight into interstellar space. The immense regions between star systems in a galaxy are not a complete vacuum. The stew of matter and radiation present in low densities - mostly gas - is called the interstellar medium. About 15% of the visible matter in our Milky Way galaxy is composed of this interstellar gas, dust and energetic particles like cosmic rays. Much of the interstellar medium is in what is called an ionized, or electrically charged, state called plasma. ""Interstellar plasma is extremely diffuse compared to what we're used to on Earth. In this plasma, there are about 0.1 atoms for every cubic centimeter, whereas the air we breathe on Earth has billions of atoms for every cubic centimeter,"" Ocker said. Voyager 1 previously detected disturbances in the gas in interstellar space triggered by occasional flares from our sun. The new study instead reveals the steady vibrations unrelated to solar activity that could be a constant feature in interstellar space. This hum has a frequency of about 3 kilohertz (kHz). ""When the plasma oscillations are converted to an audio signal, it sounds like a tone that varies. It's a bit eerie,"" said Cornell University astronomy professor and study co-author  James Cordes. After 44 years of travel, Voyager 1 is the most distant human-made object in space. ""Voyager 1 will keep going but its power supply will run out most likely this decade after up to 50 years of service,"" Cordes said. ""There are conceptual designs being made for future probes whose intended purpose is to reach further than the Voyager spacecraft. That is the message I find appealing: our reach is expanding into interstellar space.""

science,Explainer: Why all the fuss over falling debris from China?�s most powerful rocket?," BEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - China launched into orbit last month the first piece of a permanent space station using its most powerful rocket, but international focus has fallen instead on the re-entry of debris which critics say has been shrouded in secrecy. WHAT HAPPENED? The Long March 5B rocket successfully delivered its payload into orbit on April 29, Media reports warned of an ""uncontrolled"" re-entry of the rocket's core stage, rekindling memories of debris from the flight of the first Long March 5B in May 2020, which damaged buildings when it landed in Ivory Coast. Remnants from the rocket WHAT DID CHINA SAY? The China National Space Administration (CNSA) said nothing ""That left foreign observers scrambling to map the discarded heavy stage of the Long March 5B and guesstimate its final destination on Earth,"" said Richard de Grijs, professor of astrophysics at Macquarie University. ""This caused anxiety to a large number of nations in the potential impact area."" The debris landed in the Indian Ocean near the Maldives and India. CNSA declined to comment. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, told reporters on Monday that China had shared the results of re-entry predictions through ""international cooperation mechanisms,"" when asked whether the Maldives and India had been informed. She did not say when the results were shared. Space-faring nations LITTLE KNOWN Scientists know little about the rocket itself - including its design for demise. The core stage was not discarded until its payload - the space station module Tianhe - reached orbit. In contrast, rocket stages typically drop off more quickly, making their landing sites more predictable. But falling off too quickly could have run the risk of not inserting a huge payload into orbit. The Long March 5B has only one core stage, unlike other rockets with two or even three stages. ""It seems that China's rocket design has prioritised power above all else, that is, enough power to lift heavy payloads to orbit,"" said de Grijs. The chances of space junk damaging property and taking human lives are tiny, scientists say, with most burning up in the Earth's atmosphere, but sturdier components can survive. ""(The rocket) was not forced to re-enter and was left to natural processes to remove it from orbit,"" said Moriba Jah, associate professor in aerospace engineering at the University of Texas. He said ""natural rocket decay should be avoided at all costs"" because of the risk that chunks of the rocket could survive the re-entry. 'DEVIATION FROM THE NORM' The rocket's main stage is about 33 metres long, and has a diameter of 5 metres. The government gave no official data on its mass, but observers say it weighs about 21 tonnes - heavier than China's two earlier prototype space stations combined - Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2. There have been no reports of damage so far from the recently launched rocket. ""In the past year, two of China's Long March 5B rocket stages have not fully burned up on re-entry, so that is a noticeable deviation from the norm,"" said de Grijs. Within China, media reports of debris from rocket launches are common. The Long March 5B is next expected to deliver two other space station modules in May and August next year. Other missions will involve the smaller Long March 7 and 2F rockets.

science,NASA spacecraft starts trip back to Earth after collecting asteroid samples," May 11 (Reuters) - A NASA spacecraft, which scientists believe has collected samples from an asteroid, began its two-year journey back to Earth on Monday. NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is attempting to complete a mission to visit Bennu, a skyscraper-sized asteroid some 200 million miles (320 million km) from Earth, survey the surface, collect samples and deliver them back to Earth. Staff celebrated at the OSIRIS-REx control room in Colorado as the space vehicle pushed away from the asteroid, whose acorn-shaped body formed in the early days of our solar system. OSIRIS-REx arrived at Bennu in 2018. The spacecraft found traces of hydrogen and oxygen molecules - part of the recipe for water and thus the potential for life - embedded in the asteroid's rocky surface, said Dante Lauretta, the OSIRIS-REx mission's principal investigator, in 2018. The trip back to Earth will take about two years. The spacecraft will then eject a capsule containing the asteroid samples, which NASA says will land in a remote area of Utah. NASA says samples will be distributed to research laboratories worldwide, but 75% of the samples will be preserved at the Johnson Space Center in Houston for future generations to study with technologies not yet created. The roughly $800 million, minivan-sized OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, launched in 2016 to grab and return the first U.S. sample of pristine asteroid materials. Japan is the only other country to have accomplished such a feat. Asteroids are among the leftover debris from the solar system's formation some 4.5 billion years ago.

science,New antibody drug helps patients breathe; virus may insert genetic fragments into genetic code," May 10 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. New drug helps COVID-19 patients breathe on their own When a new monoclonal antibody drug was added to treatments being given to hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were still breathing on their own, the drug - lenzilumab from Humanigen Inc Virus might insert genetic fragments into patients' genetic code A controversial new paper based on laboratory experiments suggests a possible explanation for why some COVID-19 survivors still test positive on viral RNA tests months later. Small fragments of genetic instructions from the coronavirus might get integrated into infected cells' genome. In the experiments, the fragments that got inserted into the cell's genetic code came mainly from the tail-end of the viral genome and cannot induce the cell to create infectious virus. However, they might be enough to trigger a positive result on COVID-19 PCR tests. ""There is no evidence that the process of these integrations into the genome causes harm,"" said study leader Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT, adding that the researchers believe that is very unlikely. Other experts have said the findings, reported on Thursday in the journal PNAS, likely reflect unintended effects of experimental methods. The researchers have so far seen the phenomenon only in test tubes. They are trying to find direct evidence for SARS-CoV-2 sequences integrated into the genome in patients, ""but these experiments are technically very challenging,"" Jaenisch said. The vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech Home monitoring may keep COVID-19 patients out of hospital A home monitoring program for patients with COVID-19 may be associated with lower odds of hospitalization, according to a new study. At the Cleveland Clinic, doctors remotely monitored 3,975 COVID-19 patients for up to 14 days after a positive test. In a study published on Thursday in JAMA Health Forum, they compared patterns of healthcare use by these patients and by 3,221 similar patients who did not participate in the program. A month after diagnosis, participants in the home monitoring program were 27% less likely than nonparticipants to have been hospitalized, although they had about a two-fold higher likelihood of outpatient visits with the home monitoring program. ""As the pandemic continued and we learned more and more about the outcomes of the program, and the natural course of COVID infections in groups of patients, we were able to fine tune the program to those with highest risk,"" said Dr. Anita Misra-Hebert, director of the Clinic's Healthcare Delivery & Implementation Science Center. The trial was not randomized and  does not provide conclusive evidence of the program's value. Instead, the researchers write, the results ""support the need for randomized trials to evaluate home monitoring programs ... after COVID-19 diagnosis.""

Eight of the remains are dated to between 50,000 and 68,000 years ago, while one, the oldest, is dated to between 90,000 and 100,000 years ago, the ministry said in a statement. The find occurred in Grotta Guattari, prehistoric caves discovered more than 80 years ago, located around 100 metres from the coast of Tyrrhenian Sea in San Felice Circeo, near Latina, in the Lazio region. Video footage from the ministry showed bones, craniums and other body parts found at the site. Neanderthals, the closest ancient relatives of humans, died out about 40,000 years ago. It is unclear what killed them off, although theories include an inability to adapt to climate change and increased competition from modern humans. Taking into account other remains found previously at the same site, there are in total 11 individuals present in Grotta Guattari, which is ""confirmed as one of the most significant places in the world for the history of Neanderthal man,"" the ministry said.

science,"Pint-sized Mongolian menace shows dinosaurs loved the nightlife, too"," May 6 (Reuters) - Under the cover of darkness in desert habitats about 70 million years ago, in what is today Mongolia and northern China, a gangly looking dinosaur employed excellent night vision and superb hearing to thrive as a menacing pint-sized nocturnal predator. Scientists said on Thursday an examination of a ring of bones surrounding the pupil and a bony tube inside the skull that houses the hearing organ showed that this dinosaur, called Shuvuuia deserti, boasted visual and auditory capabilities akin to a barn owl, indicating it could it hunt in total darkness. Their study, published in the journal Science, showed that predatory dinosaurs overall generally possessed better-than-average hearing - helpful for hunters - but had vision optimized for daytime. In contrast, Shuvuuia (pronounced shu-VOO-ee-ah) loved the nightlife. Shuvuuia was a pheasant-sized, two-legged Cretaceous Period dinosaur weighing about as much as a small house cat. Lacking the strong jaws and sharp teeth of many carnivorous dinosaurs, it had a remarkably bird-like and lightly built skull and many tiny teeth like grains of rice. Its mid-length neck and small head, coupled with very long legs, made it resemble an awkward chicken. Unlike birds, it had short but powerful arms ending in a single large claw, good for digging. ""Shuvuuia might have run across the desert floor under cover of night, using its incredible hearing and night vision to track small prey such as nocturnal mammals, lizards and insects. With its long legs it could have rapidly run down such prey, and used its digging forelimbs to pry prey loose from any cover such as a burrow,"" said paleontologist Jonah Choiniere of the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, the study's lead author. ""It's such a strange animal that paleontologists have long wondered what it was actually doing,"" added paleontologist Roger Benson of the University of Oxford in England, who helped lead the study. The researchers looked at a structure called the lagena, a curving and finger-like sac that sits in a cavity in the bones surrounding the brain and is connected to the part of the ear that lets reptiles and birds keep balance and move their heads while walking. Acute hearing helps nocturnal predators locate prey. The longer the lagena, the better hearing an animal has. The barn owl, a proficient nocturnal predator even in pitch-black conditions, has the proportionally longest lagena of any living bird. Shuvuuia is unique among predatory dinosaurs with a hyper-elongated lagena, almost identical in relative size to a barn owl's. The researchers also looked at a series of tiny bones called the scleral ring that encircle the pupil of the eye. It exists in birds and lizards and was present in the ancestors of today's mammals. Shuvuuia had a very wide scleral ring, indicating an extra-large pupil size that made its eye a specialized light-capture device. The study found that nocturnality was uncommon among dinosaurs, aside from a group called alvarezsaurs to which Shuvuuia belonged. Alvarezsaurs had nocturnal vision very early in their lineage, but super-hearing took more time to evolve. ""Like many paleontologists, I once considered that nighttime in the age of dinosaurs was when the mammals came out of hiding to avoid predation and competition. The importance of these findings is that it forces us to imagine dinosaurs like Shuvuuia evolving to take advantage of these nocturnal communities,"" Choiniere said. Benson added, ""This really shows that dinosaurs had a wide range of skills and adaptations that are only just coming to light now. We find evidence that there was a thriving 'nightlife' during the time of dinosaurs.""

science,Virgin Orbit among new operators for Brazil's Alcântara spaceport," BRASILIA, May 6 (Reuters) - Billionaire Richard Branson's modified Boeing 747 may soon be taking off from Brazil's northern coast to launch rockets into orbit as the South American country seeks a piece of the small satellite market. The Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) and Air Force announced last week the selection of four companies, including Branson's Virgin Orbit, to operate from the Alcântara launch center. Its location near the planet's equator allows for larger payloads and less costly rocket launches, said AEB head Carlos Moura, who forecast the first-ever orbital flight launched from Brazil for the first half of 2022. Moura also expects contracts to be signed by the end of this year with Hyperion Rocket Systems Inc, based in Delaware, to operate from Alcântara's main launch pad, along with Canadian company C6 Launch and Virginia-based Orion AST, which will operate launches initially aimed at collecting space junk. Virgin Orbit will operate from the air base's existing 2.6-kilometer (1.6-mile) runway with no special infrastructure needed for its rockets launched from an airplane in flight, the company said in a news release. The Brazilian space program is looking to capture a niche within the global space launch services market, worth an estimated at $300 billion a year. Brazil would be getting a slice of the small satellite launch market, expected to grow to $18 billion by 2029, according to Arcturus Advisors, a management consulting firm in Florida.

science,SpaceX Starship rocket prototype achieves first safe landing," May 5 (Reuters) - SpaceX achieved the first successful touchdown of its prototype Starship rocket during the latest test flight of the next-generation launch vehicle in south Texas on Wednesday, after four previous landing attempts ended in explosions. The feat marked a key milestone for the private rocket company of billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk in its development of a resusable heavy-lift launch vehicle to eventually carry astronauts and large cargo payloads to the moon and Mars. The Starship SN15 blasted off from the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, along the Gulf Coast and reached its planned maximum altitude of 10 kilometers (6 miles), then hovered momentarily before flying nose-down under aerodynamic control back toward Earth. Maneuvering itself back into vertical position under rocket thrust as it approached the ground, the 16-story, three-engine vehicle descended to a gentle touchdown on its landing gear. ""We are down, the Starship has landed,"" SpaceX principal integration engineer John Insprucker said during live commentary for the flight. A video feed of the landing showed flames continuing to burn at the base of the rocket after the engines cut off, but an automated fire-suppression system trained a steady stream of water onto the landing pad, eventually extinguishing the blaze. The flight came on the 60th anniversary of the first spaceflight by an American astronaut - Alan Shepard's launch on a 15-minute suborbital mission atop NASA's Mercury-Redstone rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk declared success on Twitter, posting a terse message in the understated parlance of spaceflight: ""Starship landing nominal!"" Four previous test flights of Starship prototypes - SN8 in December, SN9 in February and SN10 and SN11 in March - all blasted off successfully but blew to pieces. The complete Starship rocket, which will stand 394 feet (120 meters) tall when mated with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is SpaceX's next-generation launch vehicle at the center of Musk's ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.

science,Virgin Hyperloop shows off the future: mass transport in floating magnetic pods," May 6 (Reuters) - In the desert just north of Las Vegas, a long white metal tube sits at the base of the mountains, promising to one day revolutionize travel. That is where Virgin Hyperloop, whose partners include Richard Branson's Virgin Group, is developing the technology for passenger pods that will hurtle at speeds of up to 750 miles an hour (1,200 kph) through almost air-free vacuum tunnels using magnetic levitation. ""It will feel like an aircraft at take-off and once you're at speed,"" said co-founder and Chief Executive Josh Giegel, who gave Reuters an exclusive tour of the pod used in its November test run, where it was propelled along a 500 meter (1,640 ft)tunnel. ""You won't even have turbulence because our system is basically completely able to react to all that turbulence. Think noise-canceling but bump-canceling, if you will."" Off-white materials and a back mirror make the pod seem bigger and more ""inviting"" for new users, Giegel said. ""This pod was really the embodiment of 'How do we take something that's an idea and make it into something that's a reality for us to sit in?' Giegel said. The pods will seat 28 passengers and could be customized for long and short distances, and for freight. While it is still at an early stage, Giegel predicts commercial operations as early as 2027. It could be the first form of transport in 100 years to revolutionize travel, just like cars, trains and planes did, Giegel said. Rocket scientist Robert Goddard came up with the ""vactrain"" idea in the early 1900s. France tried to develop the Aerotrain in the 1960s and 1970s, but lack of funding killed the project. Entrepreneur Elon Musk reignited interest in 2013 by setting out how a modern system would work. Giegel, who worked at Musk's SpaceX at the time, said technology is now catching up. The required batteries, power electronics and some sensors were previously not quite ready, Giegel said. ""We're at like the very bleeding edge of what a high-speed autonomous battery-powered vehicle is."" Virgin Hyperloop is looking to first develop passenger routes in India, where the transport system is overloaded, and in Saudi Arabia, which lacks an infrastructure. ""It starts off with two people riding a Hyperloop. It ends with hundreds of millions of people riding on a Hyperloop and that's what the 2020s, the roaring 20s will be,"" Giegel said. The pod will be on display at the Smithsonian Historic Arts and Industries Museum?�s ?�FUTURES??exhibition in Washington in late summer.

science,No plan to shoot down Chinese rocket -Pentagon chief," WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday there was no plan at this point to shoot down the remnants of a large Chinese rocket expected to plunge back through the atmosphere this weekend. The Long March 5B rocket blasted off from China's Hainan island on April 29, carrying the Tianhe module, which contains what will become living quarters for three crew members on a permanent Chinese space station. The Tianhe launch was the first of 11 missions needed to complete the station Speaking with reporters, Austin said the hope was the rocket would land in the ocean and that the latest estimate was that it would come down between Saturday and Sunday. The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the official People's Daily, characterized reports that the rocket is ""out of control"" and could cause damage as ""Western hype.""

science,U.S. Space Command tracks Chinese rocket for uncontrolled re-entry from orbit," LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Reuters) - Remnants of a large Chinese rocket launched last week are expected to plunge back through the atmosphere this weekend in an uncontrolled re-entry being tracked by U.S. Space Command, the U.S. military said on Wednesday. The Long March 5B rocket blasted off from China?�s Hainan island on April 29 carrying the Tianhe module, which contains what will become living quarters for three crew on a permanent The rocket's exact point of descent into Earth's atmosphere as it falls back from space ""cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its reentry,"" which is projected to occur around May 8, Space Command said in a statement posted online. Harvard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said potentially dangerous debris will likely escape incineration after streaking through the atmosphere at hypersonic speed but in all likelihood would fall into the sea, given that 70% of the world is covered by ocean. There is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area, as in May 2020, when pieces from another Chinese Long March 5B rocket rained down on the Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings, though no injuries were reported, McDowell told Reuters. The 18th Space Control Squadron at Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 160 miles (257 km) northwest of Los Angeles, is tracking the spent rocket, plotting updates on its location as it descends, the U.S. Space Command said. The squadron tracks more than 27,000 man-made objects in space, most of them in low orbit, it said. The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the official People?�s Daily, characterized reports that the rocket is ?�out of control??and could cause damage as ??""Most of the debris will burn up during re-entry ... leaving only a very small portion that may fall to the ground, which will potentially land on areas away from human activities or in the ocean,"" Wang Yanan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, was quoted as saying by the newspaper. McDowell, a member of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the rocket's main stage core, believed to weigh about 21 tons, would likely break into a shower of debris equivalent to that of a small plane crash and come down in a narrow trail stretching about 100 miles. Based on its current orbit, the debris trail is likely to fall somewhere as far north as New York, Madrid or Beijing and as far south as southern Chile and Wellington, New Zealand, or anywhere in between, McDowell said. McDowell said most countries have sought to design spacecraft in such a way as to avoid large, uncontrolled re-entries, since large chunks of the NASA space station Skylab fell from orbit in July 1979 and landed in Australia. ?�It makes the Chinese rocket designers look lazy that they didn?�t address this,??he said, calling the situation ?�negligent.??Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,"Chinese rocket debris lands in Indian Ocean, draws criticism from NASA"," BEIJING, May 9 (Reuters) - Remnants of China's biggest rocket landed in the Indian Ocean on Sunday, with most of its components destroyed upon re-entry into the atmosphere, ending days of speculation over where the debris would hit but drawing U.S. criticism over lack of transparency. The coordinates given by Chinese state media, citing the China Manned Space Engineering Office, put the point of impact in the ocean, west of the Maldives archipelago. Debris from the Long March 5B has had some people looking warily skyward since it blasted off from China's Hainan island on April 29, but the China Manned Space Engineering Office said most of the debris was burnt up in the atmosphere. State media reported parts of the rocket re-entered the atmosphere at 10:24 a.m. Beijing time (0224 GMT) and landed at a location with the coordinates of longitude 72.47 degrees east and latitude 2.65 degrees north. The U.S. Space command confirmed the re-entry of the rocket over the Arabian Peninsula, but said it was unknown if the debris impacted land or water. ""The exact location of the impact and the span of debris, both of which are unknown at this time, will not be released by U.S. Space Command,"" it said in a statement on its website. The Long March was the second deployment of the 5B variant since its maiden flight in May 2020. Last year, pieces from the first Long March 5B fell on Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings. No injuries were reported. ""Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, a former senator and astronaut who was picked for the role in March, said in a statement after the re-entry. ""It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris."" ANXIETY OVER POTENTIAL DEBRIS ZONE With most of the Earth's surface covered by water, the odds of populated area on land being hit had been low, and the likelihood of injuries even lower, according to experts. But uncertainty over the rocket's orbital decay and China's failure to issue stronger reassurances in the run-up to the re-entry fuelled anxiety. ""It is critical that China and all spacefaring nations and commercial entities act responsibly and transparently in space to ensure the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of outer space activities,"" Nelson said. Harvard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told Reuters that the potential debris zone could have been as far north as New York, Madrid or Beijing, and as far south as southern Chile and Wellington, New Zealand. Since large chunks of the NASA space station Skylab fell from orbit in July 1979 and landed in Australia, most countries have sought to avoid such uncontrolled re-entries through their spacecraft design, McDowell said. ""It makes the Chinese rocket designers look lazy that they didn't address this,"" said McDowell. The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid, dismissed as ""Western hype"" concerns the rocket was ""out of control"" and could cause damage. ""It is common practice across the world for upper stages of rockets to burn up while reentering the atmosphere,"" Wang Wenbin, a spokesman at China's foreign ministry, said at a regular media briefing on May 7. ""To my knowledge, the upper stage of this rocket has been deactivated, which means most of its parts will burn up upon re-entry, making the likelihood of damage to aviation or ground facilities and activities extremely low,"" Wang said at the time. The rocket, which put into orbit an unmanned Tianhe module containing what will become living quarters for three crew on a permanent Chinese space station, will be followed by 10 more missions to complete the station by 2022.

science,Blue Origin opens up bidding for first 'spectacular' space tourism trip in July," SEATTLE, May 5 (Reuters) - Blue Origin, billionaire Jeff Bezos' rocket company, said on Wednesday it is targeting July 20 for its first suborbital sightseeing trip on its New Shepard spacecraft, a landmark moment in a competition to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel. Blue Origin also said it will offer one seat on the first flight to the winning bidder of a five-week online auction, the proceeds of which will be donated to the space firm's foundation. The New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes. The capsule features six observation windows Blue Origin says are nearly three times as tall as those on a Boeing 747 jetliner and the largest ever used in space. ""The view will be spectacular,"" Blue Origin's Director of Astronaut Sales, Ariane Cornell, told a media briefing. After its first flight in July, Cornell said Blue Origin would have ""a couple more"" crewed flights before the end of the year. She declined to disclose details of the ticket price, which has been a closely guarded secret inside the company for years. Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on an appraisal of rival plans from billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc Wednesday's announcement follows years of testing and development work that has included delays. Cornell said Blue Origin would ""love"" to increase the frequency of its tourist spaceflights and add launch locations, possibly outside the United States, depending on demand. For July's flight, the reusable New Shepard booster will launch and land in West Texas. Celebrities and the uber-rich appear to be the core market for space tourist jaunts, at least initially. Cornell told reporters the most likely candidates would be ""very clear on our radar."" Only 569 people had ever been into space, she said, adding that ""we're about to change that dramatically."" But she declined to say when - or if - Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast and currently the world's richest person, will take a trip on New Shepard. Virgin Galactic also aims to fly private customers in early 2022, after a first flight with Branson on board later this year. Its zero-gravity experience is anchored by its SpaceShipTwo plane, and the company has ambitious plans to offer point-to-point travel between far-flung cities at near-space altitudes. Virgin says it will charge more than $250,000 for new reservations but has not announced final pricing. Sales will reopen following Branson's flight. Meanwhile, a college science professor and an aerospace data analyst are among a four-member crew for a launch into orbit planned later this year by Elon Musk's SpaceX, part of a charity drive billed as the first all-civilian spaceflight in history.

But its space tourism announcement provides Bezos, who founded Amazon.com Inc Regulatory filings revealed that Bezos sold Amazon shares worth about $2 billion this week as a part of an arranged trading plan.

science,"Child's burial 78,000 years ago in Kenya was a Homo sapiens milestone"," May 5 (Reuters) - It is a scene that exudes sadness: a child perhaps 2-1/2 or 3 years old buried in a shallow grave under the sheltered overhang of a cave, head resting on a pillow and the upper part of the body carefully wrapped in a shroud. Scientists said on Wednesday they have found the oldest-known human burial in Africa, the continent that gave rise to our species, dating to about 78,000 years ago at a cave site called Panga ya Saidi near the Kenyan coast. They nicknamed the youngster 'Mtoto,' meaning 'child' in Swahili. The discovery, the researchers said, sheds light on the development of early complex social behaviors in Homo sapiens. ""This is at the root of the symbolic mind that characterizes Homo sapiens,"" said anthropologist María Martinón-Torres, director of the National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) in Spain and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature. ""The child was buried in a residential site, close to where this community lived, evincing how intimately life and death are related. Only humans treat the dead with the same respect, consideration and even tenderness they treat the living. Even when we die, we continue to be someone for our group,"" Martinón-Torres added. Homo sapiens first appeared in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, later spreading worldwide. The highly decomposed bones, found in a circular pit, were encased in plaster and eventually taken to CENIEH for study. The researchers determined that the child, whose gender remains unclear, was placed in the grave in a flexed position, the body lying on its right side, with knees drawn toward the chest. The cranium and three neck bones collapsed into a void left by the decay of a pillow made of perishable material. The position of a shoulder bone and two ribs indicated the upper body was wrapped in a perishable material. The body was fresh at the time of burial, rapidly covered with earth scooped from the cave's floor. ""This would likely have been a group act, perhaps by members of the child's family. All of these behaviors are, of course, very similar to those observed in our own species today, so we can relate to this act even though the burial dates to 78,000 years ago,"" said study co-author Nicole Boivin, an archaeologist and director at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany. The researchers pondered the special significance of a child's burial. ""It is certainly very interesting and may be evincing a particular grief or sorrow to such an early loss of someone they loved,"" Martinón-Torres said. It is unclear when funerary behavior began, but ancient Homo sapiens and our Neanderthal cousins both practiced it. Martinón-Torres called it ""a type of behavior that allow us to maintain links with those who died and offer a farewell."" The oldest apparent Neanderthal burial site, in Israel, dates to about 120,000 years ago, similar in age to the oldest-known Homo sapiens burials, also in Israel, Boivin said. The researchers said it is unclear whether funerary behavior began outside Africa and was later adopted in Africa or began in Africa but archeological evidence is lacking. Mtoto was part of a hunter-gatherer culture, with remains of various antelope species and other prey found at the site, an upland setting in a tropical forest. Also found were stone tools for scraping and boring holes, and stone points that could be used as part of a spear. ""So, we have a picture of what life was like at the time of Mtoto's life and death,"" Boivin said.

science,Chinese rocket debris set for re-entry in coming hours- tracking centres," SHANGHAI, May 8 (Reuters) - Remnants of China?�s largest rocket launched last week are expected to plunge back through the atmosphere in the coming hours, European and U.S. tracking centres said on Saturday. While there were still varying estimates of where the rocket would land, it appeared increasingly likely it would not hit the United States. China?�s foreign ministry said on Friday that U.S. Space Command estimated re-entry would occur at 0211 GMT on Sunday, plus or minus one hour, while the Center for Orbital Reentry and Debris Studies (CORDS) at Aerospace Corporation, a U.S. federally funded space-focused research and development centre, updated its prediction to two hours either side of 0302 GMT with the rocket re-entering over the Pacific. EU Space Surveillance and Tracking (EU SST) said its latest prediction for the timing of the re-entry of the Long March 5B rocket body was 139 minutes either side of 0232 GMT on Sunday. EU SST said the statistical probability of a ground impact in a populated area is ""low"", but noted that the uncontrolled nature of the object made any predictions uncertain. Space-Track, reporting data collected by U.S. Space Command, estimated the debris would make reentry over the Mediterranean Basin. Harvard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said on Twitter that it was believed the United States was safe from a potential impact but recent predictions were still tracking it from Costa Rica all the way to Australia and New Zealand. Travelling at a speed of around 4.8 miles per second, a difference of just one minute in the time of reentry translates to hundreds of miles difference on the ground. ""This is difficult to predict and not an exact measurement,"" Space-Track wrote on Twitter. MORE MISSIONS TO COME The Long March 5B - comprising one core stage and four boosters - lifted off from China's Hainan island on April 29 with the unmanned Tianhe module, which contains what will become living quarters on a permanent Chinese space station. The rocket is set to be followed by 10 more missions to complete the station. Long March 5 rockets have been integral to China's near-term space ambitions - from the delivery of modules and crew of its planned space station to launches of exploratory probes to the Moon and even Mars. The Long March launched last week was the second deployment of the 5B variant since its maiden flight in May last year. McDowell previously told Reuters there is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area, as in May 2020, when pieces from the first Long March 5B fell on Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings. No injuries were reported. Debris from Chinese rocket launches is not uncommon within China. In late April, authorities in the city of Shiyan, Hubei Province, issued a notice to people in the surrounding county to prepare for evacuation as parts were expected to land in the area. ""The Long March 5B reentry is unusual because during launch, the first stage of the rocket reached orbital velocity instead of falling down range as is common practice,"" the Aerospace Corporation said in a blog post. ""The empty rocket body is now in an elliptical orbit around Earth where it is being dragged toward an uncontrolled re-entry."" The empty core stage has been losing altitude since last week, but the speed of its orbital decay remains uncertain due to unpredictable atmospheric variables. It is one of the largest pieces of space debris to return to Earth, with experts estimating its dry mass to be around 18 to 22 tonnes. The core stage of the first Long March 5B that returned to Earth last year weighed nearly 20 tonnes, surpassed only by debris from the Columbia space shuttle in 2003, the Soviet Union?�s Salyut 7 space station in 1991, and NASA?�s Skylab in 1979.

science,Archaeologists uncover Neanderthal remains in caves near Rome," MILAN, May 8 (Reuters) - Archaeologists discovered the remains of nine Neanderthals at a prehistoric site near Rome, Italy?�s Culture ministry said on Saturday. Eight of the remains are dated to between 50,000 and 68,000 years ago, while one, the oldest, is dated to between 90,000 and 100,000 years ago, the ministry said in a statement. The find occurred in Grotta Guattari, prehistoric caves discovered more than 80 years ago, located around 100 metres from the coast of Tyrrhenian Sea in San Felice Circeo, near Latina, in the Lazio region. Video footage from the ministry showed bones, craniums and other body parts found at the site. Neanderthals, the closest ancient relatives of humans, died out about 40,000 years ago. It is unclear what killed them off, although theories include an inability to adapt to climate change and increased competition from modern humans. Taking into account other remains found previously at the same site, there are in total 11 individuals present in Grotta Guattari, which is ""confirmed as one of the most significant places in the world for the history of Neanderthal man,"" the ministry said.

science,Sperm not impacted by Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine; neuropsychiatric symptoms persist in COVID-19 survivors," May 5 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears not to affect sperm The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine from Pfizer Inc Neuropsychiatric symptoms persist in COVID-19 survivors Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in COVID-19 survivors, a large new analysis confirms. Researchers pooled data from 51 studies involving a total of nearly 19,000 patients who were tracked for up to six months. The average follow-up was 77 days post-diagnosis. Overall, 27.4% reported sleep problems, 24.4% had fatigue, 20.2% scored poorly on objective tests of cognition, 19.1% reported anxiety, and 15.7% had post-traumatic stress. Nerve disturbances and dizziness or vertigo were less common but were seen in ""a non-negligible proportion"" of patients, the research team reported on Tuesday in a paper posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Only about 7% of the patients were said to have required intensive care, based on this meta-analysis in which some papers were not clear on intensive care figures. ""There was little or no evidence of differential symptom prevalence based on hospitalization status, severity, or follow-up duration,"" the researchers said. They caution that some of the patients may still have been in the acute phase of their infections, and longer follow-up will be necessary to know how long these problems persist, and whether they are effects of viral infection in general or are specific to the new coronavirus. ( Vaccines protect unvaccinated household members, too Compared to an unvaccinated COVID-19 patient, a vaccinated person who nevertheless becomes infected with the coronavirus has a much lower risk of transmitting the virus to household members, a large UK study found. Researchers at Public Health England studied more than 365,000 households with a first COVID-19 infection, including more than 24,000 households in which the so called ""index case"" of COVID-19 was someone who had received at least one dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 nasal swab test complications extremely rare Severe complications associated with nasal swab tests for COVID-19 are very rare, a new study found. Researchers in Finland looked at six months of hospital emergency department data in a region where more than 640,000 such tests had been performed. They found that only eight patients needed emergency care for swab test-related problems. Four of the eight cases were due to broken swabs and four to uncontrollable nosebleeds. All of the complications occurred immediately after swab tests, according to a report published on Thursday in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery. The overall rate was 1.24 emergencies for every 100,000 performed tests. While the study may have missed minor complications, it showed that COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab testing ""is safe and complications are extremely rare,"" said coauthor Dr. Anni Koskinen of the University of Helsinki. All of the complications seemed to involve an incorrect sampling technique or misdirection of the swab, her team reported. ""Force should never be used, especially in patients with known prior operations of the nose or skull base,"" they advised.

science,China says its rocket debris unlikely to cause any harm," BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - Most debris from a large Chinese rocket expected to plunge back through the atmosphere this weekend will be burned up on reentry and is highly unlikely to cause any harm, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Friday. The U.S. military said on Wednesday what it called an uncontrolled re-entry was being tracked by U.S. Space Command. The Long March 5B rocket blasted off from China's Hainan island on April 29, carrying the unmanned Tianhe module, which contains what will become living quarters on a permanent Chinese space station. The location of the rocket's descent into Earth's atmosphere as it falls back from space ""cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its reentry"", which is projected to occur around May 8, U.S. Space Command said. Harvard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told Reuters this week there was a chance that He said potentially dangerous debris would likely escape incineration after streaking through the atmosphere at hypersonic speed but in all likelihood would fall into the sea, given that 70% of the world is covered by ocean. Speaking in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China was closely following the rocket's reentry into the atmosphere, and that most of its components would be burned up upon re-entry. ""The probability of this process causing harm on the ground is extremely low,"" he said. Debris from the Long March 5B is likely to Based on its current orbit, the debris trail is likely to fall somewhere as far north as New York, Madrid or Beijing and as far south as southern Chile and Wellington, New Zealand, or anywhere in between, McDowell said. The Tianhe launch was the first of 11 missions needed to complete the Chinese space station.

science,How scientists are using a 'romantic solution' to save endangered white abalone," May 5 (Reuters) - White abalone - whose flesh is a delicacy and polished shell is prized as mother of pearl - are threatened with extinction. But scientists are looking to turn the tide for these unique sea snails by playing Cupid. ""White abalone are on the brink of extinction. They cannot come back without our help,"" said Kristin Aquilino, lead scientist for the White Abalone Captive Breeding Program, based at the University of California, Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory. The mollusk, once common in the coastal waters of Southern California and Mexico, has been on the U.S. federal endangered list since 2001, its population depleted by overfishing, low reproduction rates and disease. After about a decade during which no white abalone were spawned, Aquilino's team managed to increase their numbers by stirring up a little love potion. On breeding days, Aquilino and her team are up before dawn, scooping up the wild sea snails from tanks. ""We're hoping she releases those eggs today,"" Aquilino said, while holding a female abalone, marked by her grey-colored gonad. In the day-long process, the scientists soak the snails for hours in what they call a ""chemical love potion"" of seawater and hydrogen peroxide, providing an aphrodisiac for the bottom dwellers to release their sperm and eggs. ""The abalone are terrible at long-distance relationships,"" Aquilino said. ""We're putting them in a really romantic solution ... to get them to release those gametes for us so that we can combine them in a laboratory setting and create offspring that will end up back out in the wild."" Spawning numbers reached 25,000 in 2019, but dipped in 2020 as pandemic lockdowns limited the lab to just one event for the season. However, the larvae spawned then had among the highest survival rates so far, Aquilino said. Failure to spawn means another date several weeks later. ""We want to make sure we're not stressing them out too much,"" Aquilino said. ""Hopefully that little bit of extra time gives them some more time to become very productive."" Embryos formed are packed in bags and shipped to partner institutions in California so that the juvenile abalone have a better chance of survival with more space. For Aquilino, the work is personal. As a graduate student, she met her husband on a red abalone survey dive. Her engagement ring features an abalone pearl. And their daughter plays with a fake abalone farm tank at home. ""It has become a really important part of my identity and my family's identity,"" Aquilino said.

science,How long is the solar system's longest day? Venus has the answer.," WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - Data obtained by bouncing radio waves off Venus - treating it, as one scientist said, like a giant disco ball - is providing new insight into Earth's closest planetary neighbor, including a precise calculation of the duration of a Venusian day. The study also measured the tilt of the Venusian axis and size of the planet's core, allowing for a deeper understanding of an enigmatic world sometimes called Earth's 'evil twin.' It was already known that Venus has the longest day - the time the planet takes for a single rotation on its axis - of any planet in our solar system, though there were discrepancies among previous estimates. The study found that a single Venusian rotation takes 243.0226 Earth days. That means a day lasts longer than a year on Venus, which makes a complete orbit around the sun in 225 Earth days. The researchers transmitted radio waves toward Venus 21 times from 2006 to 2020 from NASA's Goldstone Antenna in the Mojave Desert of California and studied the radio echo, which provided information on certain planetary traits, at Goldstone and at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. ""Each individual measurement was obtained by treating Venus as a giant disco ball. We illuminated Venus with a giant flashlight, the radar at Goldstone, and observed the reflections as they swept over the surface of the Earth,"" said UCLA planetary astronomy professor Jean-Luc Margot, who led the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy. ""Venus is an amazing laboratory for understanding planet formation and evolution, and it's a stone's throw away. There are likely billions of Venus-like planets in the galaxy,"" Margot added. The new data showed that the Venusian planetary core has a diameter of about 4,360 miles (7,000 km), comparable to Earth's core. Previous Venus core estimates had been based on computer modeling rather than observational data. Its core is almost certainly composed of iron and nickel, though it is unclear whether it is solid or molten, Margot said. Venus spins on its axis almost upright - meaning it lacks discernable seasons - while Earth has more of a tilt. The study calculated the Venusian tilt at about 2.64 degrees. Earth's is about 23.5 degrees. Venus, the second planet from the sun, is similar in structure but slightly smaller than Earth, with a diameter of about 7,500 miles (12,000 km). Above its foreboding landscape is a thick and toxic atmosphere that consists primarily of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. With a runaway greenhouse effect, its surface temperatures reach 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius), hot enough to melt lead. Venus spins from east to west, the opposite direction from all other planets in our solar system but Uranus. In another quirk, its day-night cycle - the time between sunrises as opposed to the length of a single axial spin - takes 117 Earth days because Venus rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital path around the sun. Venus has received less scientific attention than Mars, Earth's other planetary next-door neighbor, and other solar system destinations. ""I don't think that Venus would be more difficult to understand than other planets if we had adequate data, but there is a deplorable scarcity of data about Venus,"" Margot said. ""There have been no NASA missions to Venus in almost 30 years and about a dozen NASA missions to Mars in this time interval,"" Margot said, adding that the new findings on how Venus spins could help any future landing attempts.

science,Italy unveils new hi-tech floor design for Colosseum area," ROME, May 2 (Reuters) - The ancient Roman Colosseum is once again going to have a floor thanks to a new, hi-tech project announced by the culture ministry on Sunday. ""It is an extraordinary project,"" said Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, detailing the plans to create a flexible floor to give tourists a clearer idea of how the arena would have looked when gladiators fought to the death there. ""You will be able to walk on it and go to the centre of the Colosseum, seeing it in the same way as visitors used to up to the end of the 19th century,"" Franceschini said. The last floor was removed by archaeologists to get a better glimpse of the labyrinth of rooms and corridors that lay below the arena. It was never fully replaced. An Italian engineering firm, Milan Ingegneria, won the 18.5 million euro ($22.2 million) contract to design the new flooring and has committed to complete the project by 2023. The wooden platform will be made up of hundreds of slats that can be rotated to bring natural light into the underground chambers that once used to house the gladiators and animals before their deadly combat. The Colosseum is Italy's most popular tourist attraction, drawing some 7.6 million visitors in 2019, before the coronavirus struck. Built 2,000 years ago, the stone arena was the biggest amphitheatre in the Roman empire. It used to have up to 70,000 seats and hosted gladiator fights, executions and animal hunts. It could also be filled with water to re-enact sea battles.

science,SpaceX Starship rocket prototype achieves first safe landing," May 5 (Reuters) - SpaceX achieved the first successful touchdown of its prototype Starship rocket during the latest test flight of the next-generation launch vehicle in south Texas on Wednesday, after four previous landing attempts ended in explosions. The feat marked a key milestone for the private rocket company of billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk in its development of a resusable heavy-lift launch vehicle to eventually carry astronauts and large cargo payloads to the moon and Mars. The Starship SN15 blasted off from the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, along the Gulf Coast and reached its planned maximum altitude of 10 kilometers (6 miles), then hovered momentarily before flying nose-down under aerodynamic control back toward Earth. Maneuvering itself back into vertical position under rocket thrust as it approached the ground, the 16-story, three-engine vehicle descended to a gentle touchdown on its landing gear. ""We are down, the Starship has landed,"" SpaceX principal integration engineer John Insprucker said during live commentary for the flight. A video feed of the landing showed flames continuing to burn at the base of the rocket after the engines cut off, but an automated fire-suppression system trained a steady stream of water onto the landing pad, eventually extinguishing the blaze. The flight came on the 60th anniversary of the first spaceflight by an American astronaut - Alan Shepard's launch on a 15-minute suborbital mission atop NASA's Mercury-Redstone rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk declared success on Twitter, posting a terse message in the understated parlance of spaceflight: ""Starship landing nominal!"" Four previous test flights of Starship prototypes - SN8 in December, SN9 in February and SN10 and SN11 in March - all blasted off successfully but blew to pieces. The complete Starship rocket, which will stand 394 feet (120 meters) tall when mated with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is SpaceX's next-generation launch vehicle at the center of Musk's ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.

science,Antibody drug neutralizes virus variants in lab study; COVID-19 antibodies detectable 12 months after infection," May 3 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Experimental antibody drug neutralizes COVID-19 variants An experimental monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19 being developed by Eli Lilly and Co COVID-19 antibodies still detectable at 12 months Some COVID-19 survivors infected early in the pandemic still have detectable antibodies against the virus a year later, according to a new study. U.S. doctors collected blood samples from 250 patients, including 58 who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and 192 who had not required hospitalization. Six-to-10 months after diagnosis, all of the former inpatients and 95% of the outpatients still had neutralizing antibodies, according to a report posted on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. In the small subset of those followed for a full year, 8-of-8 people who had been hospitalized still had antibodies, as did 9-of-11 former outpatients. Antibody levels at the time of follow-up were correlated with age and with COVID-19 severity. Older age was linked with higher neutralizing antibody levels, whereas levels were ""lower and more variable"" in participants under age 65 who experienced less severe COVID-19 and did not require hospitalization, the researchers reported. They said  vaccination of COVID-19 survivors ""would be prudent"" because vaccine-induced protection against the virus will likely be more long-lived than antibodies induced by mild COVID-19. ( No link seen between COVID-19 and aspirin or ibuprofen A large new study found no indication that use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen increases people's vulnerability to infection by the new coronavirus. Because early reports had suggested such a link, researchers used the COVID Symptom Study smartphone app to query more than 2.7 million individuals in the United States, the UK and Sweden about their use of aspirin and other NSAIDs, as well as about virus symptoms, COVID-19 testing, and healthcare seeking behavior. Close to 9,000 participants reported a positive COVID-19 test during the study, according to a report posted on Sunday on medRxiv in advance of peer review. After accounting for individuals' lifestyle factors, other illnesses, and symptoms, regular use of NSAIDs was not associated with a higher risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus. ""There have been lingering concerns"" that commonly used NSAIDs ""could increase the risk of COVID infection or worsen the disease course among those who acquire the infection,"" said coauthor Dr. Andrew Chan of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""Our study shows that there is no such an association and initial concerns were probably due to the fact that individuals with other risk factors for COVID or symptoms of COVID were more likely to take NSAIDs, rather than a cause and effect relationship,"" he said.

science,NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity shifts into new operational test phase," LOS ANGELES, April 30 (Reuters) - After exceeding all expectations with its initial four test flights, the first ever by an aircraft over the surface of another planet, NASA's tiny Mars robot helicopter Ingenuity is ready for graduation. The U.S. space agency announced on Friday that Ingenuity is shifting from a pure proof-of-concept, technology demonstration mode to a more ambitious mission gauging how aerial scouting and other functions might benefit future scientific exploration of the Red Planet. Ingenuity's 30-day planned project extension was outlined during a briefing from its mission control center at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles, where the twin-rotor aircraft was designed and built. The new ""operational demonstration"" phase of the 4-pound (1.8 kg), solar-powered chopper began with its fourth takeoff on a nearly two-minute flight Friday morning, Data returned from Ingenuity later in the day showed that it covered a round-trip distance of 872 feet (266 meters) - roughly the length of three American football fields - at a speed of almost 8 miles per hour (3.5 meters per second). The helicopter flew at height of about 16 feet (5 meters), considered ideal for the ground-surveillance work it was performing while aloft and matching the altitude of its second and third flights. The latest outing topped the speed and distance records set on Sunday by flight No. 3, which went farther and faster than the test flights conducted on Earth. By comparison, Ingenuity's very first 39-second flight on Mars on April 19 climbed just 10 feet (3 meters) high, hovered in place briefly and descended straight back down for landing. While humble in terms of mere metrics, NASA likened the achievement to the Wright Brothers' historic first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. For NASA, the challenge was powering an aircraft in the ultra-thin air of Mars, whose atmosphere is just 1% as dense as Earth's, making it especially difficult to generate aerodynamic lift. To compensate engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger and spin far more rapidly than would be needed on Earth. The miniature helicopter hitched a ride to Mars strapped to the belly of the NASA science rover Perseverance, a six-wheeled astrobiology lab that landed on Feb. 18 in a vast basin called Jezero Crater after a nearly seven-month journey through space. Except for a computer software glitch that has twice delayed Ingenuity flights, the rotorcraft has operated flawlessly, meeting all technical objectives in its first three flights on Mars, said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at JPL. ""And now it's like Ingenuity is graduating, from a tech-demo phase to the new ops-demo phase,"" she said. On its latest jaunt, Ingenuity snapped 60 black-and-white images and several color photos of the Martian surface while buzzing over the planet's reddish-orange landscape. The pictures will be fashioned into three-dimensional digital elevation maps for use in selecting a suitable new takeoff and landing zone for later flights. Similar tracking operations could also be used to help mission managers conduct low-altitude science observations of sites not easily reached by a rover, and to scout for preferred rover routes to various surface destinations. The next flight, No. 5, will send Ingenuity on a one-way trip to a new ""air field"" in two or three weeks as engineers continue to press the helicopter beyond its design limits, Aung said. However, mission managers will probably not push the aircraft quite so hard as they would have otherwise without its new ""ops-demo"" mission, she told reporters. Meanwhile, JPL will continue preparing Perseverance for its primary mission, a search for traces of fossilized microorganisms in Jezero Crater. Scientists expect to begin collecting Martian rock samples there in July.

science,Polish scientists discover ancient Egyptian mummy was pregnant woman," WARSAW, April 30 (Reuters) - An ancient Egyptian mummy once believed to be the remains of a male priest is actually the embalmed body of a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy, Polish scientists said on Friday. Marzena Ozarek-Szilke, an anthropologist at the Warsaw Mummy Project, was examining a CT scan of a mummy at the National Museum in the Polish capital when she spotted something peculiar. ""When I looked at the lesser pelvis of our mummy I was interested in what was inside... I thought I saw a tiny foot,"" Ozarek-Szilke said. She asked her husband, an archaeologist who also worked on the project, to take a look. ""My husband looked at the picture and as a father of three, he said: 'Well, that's a foot'. At that moment ... the whole picture started to come together,"" Ozarek-Szilke told Reuters. The mummy came to Poland in the 19th century when the nascent University of Warsaw was creating an antiquities collection. For decades, it was thought the mummy belonged to an ancient Egyptian priest named Hor-Dehuti. However, in a discovery revealed in the Journal of Archaeological Science on Thursday, scientists at the Warsaw Mummy Project said the mummy was in fact a woman in her twenties who was between 26 and 28 weeks pregnant. The cause of death is not clear, but Ozarek-Szilke said the pregnancy may have had something to do with it. ""It is possible that the pregnancy itself contributed to the death of this woman. Now we have modern medicine, women who are between 20 and 30 weeks pregnant and something happens to the pregnancy, they have a chance to be rescued. It used to be impossible,"" she said. The discovery sheds some light on the little-known role of children in ancient Egypt and the religious beliefs of the time, but also raises many questions, according to Wojciech Ejsmond, co-director of the Warsaw Mummy Project. ""What was the status of this child in the Egyptian religion? Did it have a soul, could it go to the afterlife on its own,  could it be reborn in the afterlife... if it was not yet born?"" Ejsmond said scientists would study the mummy further to determine the cause of death and establish why the foetus was left in the body. ""We must be open to all possibilities,"" he said.

Vaccine protects COVID-19 survivors against variants In COVID-19 survivors, the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 spike protein damages blood vessels The ""spike"" proteins that the coronavirus uses to help it break into cells inflicts other damage as well, according to a new study that shines a spotlight on the many ways COVID-19 attacks organs other than the lungs. The spike proteins themselves cause direct damage to the cells that line the blood vessels, scientists found in test tube experiments using an engineered version of the spike and artery-lining cells obtained from mice. After attaching itself to the ACE2 protein on healthy cells, the spike disrupts signaling from ACE2 to the mitochondria - the cell's energy-generating structures - causing the mitochondria to become damaged, researchers reported on Friday in Circulation Research. COVID-19 is really a disease of the blood vessels, coauthor Uri Manor of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California said in a statement.  The new findings could help explain the blood clots associated with COVID-19. They could also explain ""why some people have strokes, and why some people have issues in other parts of the body,"" Manor said.

Far field blast overpressure may be a hazard to the public if the launch vehicle explodes on impact, potentially creating a shock wave that can damage windows in areas relatively far from the impact site. The FAA said SpaceX used analytical methods to calculate risks that were not approved by the agency. The FAA began requiring the safety inspector after the December launch, effective March 12. On Thursday, the FAA confirmed Administrator Steve Dickson spoke with Musk on March 12 for 30 minutes ""as part of the agency?�s continuing engagement with the company."" SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. The FAA said Dickson ""stressed the FAA?�s role in protecting public safety by ensuring regulatory compliance. He made it clear that the FAA expected SpaceX to develop and foster a robust safety culture that stresses adherence to FAA rules."" In February, the FAA said it required SpaceX to investigate the incident, including a comprehensive review of its safety culture, and added SpaceX?�s corrective actions were incorporated into a February launch.

science,China launches key module of space station planned for 2022," BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - China launched an unmanned module on Thursday containing what will become living quarters for three crew on a permanent space station that it plans to complete by the end of 2022, state media reported. The module, named ""Tianhe"", or ""Harmony of the Heavens"", was launched on the Long March 5B, China's largest carrier rocket, at 11:23 a.m. (0323 GMT) from the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on the southern island of Hainan. Tianhe is one of three main components of what would be China's first self-developed space station, rivalling the only other station in service - the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is backed by the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. China was barred from participating by the United States. ""(Tianhe) is an important pilot project in the building of a powerful nation in both technology and in space,"" state media quoted President Xi Jinping as saying in a congratulatory speech. Tianhe forms the main living quarters for three crew members in the Chinese space station, which will have a life span of at least 10 years. The Tianhe launch was the first of 11 missions needed to complete the space station, which will orbit Earth at an altitude of 340 to 450 km (211-280 miles). In the later missions, China will launch the two other core modules, four manned spacecraft and four cargo spacecraft. Work on the space station programme began a decade ago with the launch of a space lab Tiangong-1 in 2011, and later, Tiangong-2 in 2016. Both helped China test the programme's space rendezvous and docking capabilities. China aims to become a major space power by 2030. It has ramped up its space programme with visits to the moon, the launch of an uncrewed probe to Mars and the construction of its own space station. In contrast, the fate of the ageing ISS - in orbit for more than two decades - remains uncertain. The project is set to expire in 2024, barring funding from its partners. Russia said this month that it would quit the project from 2025. Russia is deepening ties with China in space as tensions with Washington rise.

science,"Michael Collins, the ?�forgotten??astronaut of Apollo 11, dies at 90"," April 28 (Reuters) - American astronaut Michael Collins, who as pilot of the Apollo 11 command module stayed behind on July 20, 1969, while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin traveled to the lunar surface to become the first humans to walk on the moon, died on Wednesday at age 90, his family said. A statement released by his family said Collins died of cancer. Often described as the ""forgotten"" third astronaut on the historic mission, Collins remained alone in the command module for more than 21 hours until his two fellow astronauts returned in the lunar module. He lost contact with mission control in Houston each time the spacecraft circled the dark side of the moon. ""Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins,"" the mission log said, referring to the biblical figure. Collins wrote an account of his experiences in his 1974 autobiography, ""Carrying the Fire,"" but largely shunned publicity. ""I know that I would be a liar or a fool if I said that I have the best of the three Apollo 11 seats, but I can say with truth and equanimity that I am perfectly satisfied with the one I have,"" Collins said in comments released by NASA in 2009. President Joe Biden said his prayers were with the Collins family. ""From his vantage point, high above the Earth, he reminded us of the fragility of our own planet, and called on us to care for it like the treasure it is,"" Biden said in a statement.     ""Godspeed, Mike."" Acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk on Wednesday hailed Collins as ""a true pioneer."" ""NASA mourns the loss of this accomplished pilot and astronaut, a friend of all who seek to push the envelope of human potential. ... His spirit will go with us as we venture toward farther horizons,"" Jurczyk said in a statement. Writing on Twitter, Aldrin paid tribute to Collins, saying: ""Dear Mike, Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future."" 'QUIET SENSE OF PURPOSE' Collins was born in Rome on Oct. 31, 1930 - the same year as both Armstrong, who died in 2012, and Aldrin. He was the son of a U.S. Army major general and, like his father, attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1952. Like many of the first generation of American astronauts, Collins started out as an Air Force test pilot. In 1963, he was chosen by NASA for its astronaut program, still in its early days but ramping up quickly at the height of the Cold War as the United States sought to push ahead of the Soviet Union and fulfill President John F. Kennedy's pledge of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade. Collins' first voyage into space came in July 1966 as pilot on Gemini X, part of the missions that prepared NASA's Apollo program. The Gemini X mission carried out a successful docking with a separate target vehicle. His second, and final, spaceflight was the historic Apollo 11. He avoided much of the media fanfare that greeted the astronauts on their return to Earth, and was later often critical of the cult of celebrity. After a short stint in government, Collins became director of the National Air and Space Museum, stepping down in 1978. He was also the author of a number of space-related books. His strongest memory from Apollo 11, he said, was looking back at the Earth, which he said seemed ""fragile."" ""I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their planet from a distance of 100,000 miles, their outlook could be fundamentally changed. That all-important border would be invisible, that noisy argument silenced,"" he said. His family's statement said it knew ""how lucky Mike felt to live the life he did."" ?�Please join us in fondly and joyfully remembering his sharp wit, his quiet sense of purpose, and his wise perspective, gained both from looking back at Earth from the vantage of space and gazing across calm waters from the deck of his fishing boat.??Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."

Global Sea Mineral Resources (GSR), the deep-sea exploratory division of dredging company DEME Group, has been testing Patania II, a 25-tonne mining robot prototype, in its concession in the Clarion Clipperton Zone since April 20. The machine is meant to collect the potato-sized nodules rich in cobalt and other battery metals that pepper the seabed in this area, and was connected to GSR's ship with a 5km cable. ""On its final dive in the GSR area, a lifting point separated and Patania II now stands on the seafloor,"" a GSR spokesman said in an emailed statement. ""An operation to reconnect the lifting point begins this evening and we will provide an update in due course."" The GSR trial is being observed by independent scientists from 29 European institutes who will analyse data and samples collected by the robot in order to measure the impact of seabed mining. While several companies and countries have seabed exploration contracts, regulations governing deep-sea mining have not yet been finalised by the International Seabed Authority, a U.N. body. Critics, including environmentalist David Attenborough, say seabed mining is untested and has a Dr Sandra Schoettner, deep-sea biologist at Greenpeace, said: ""Losing control of a 25-tonne mining machine at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean should sink the idea of ever mining the deep sea.""

science,Placental infection may be more likely early in pregnancy; COVID-19 may cause heart failure in some patients," April 28 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Placental infection may be more likely in early pregnancy The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rarely infects the placenta, but new research suggests that when such an infection does occur it is more likely to happen early in pregnancy. Analyzing 12 placentas from healthy women, ranging in gestational age from 5 weeks to 36 weeks, researchers found that the cells in the placenta that become infected with the coronavirus have the surface protein ACE2, which the virus uses as a gateway for entry. Late in pregnancy, the ACE2 proteins are positioned on cells in a way that does not expose them to the virus circulating in the mother's blood, possibly protecting the placenta from infection, said study coauthor Dr. Drucilla Roberts of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. This ""protective"" positioning pattern was less often seen in early gestation placentas, when ACE2 was typically present over the entire cell circumference, the study found. That suggests ""increased vulnerability of the early placenta to infection,"" Roberts said. ""As more pregnant women recover from first trimester SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is important to remain vigilant to possible placental infection"" and transmission from mother to fetus, the researchers said in a report published in Journal of Infectious Diseases. How often that happens, and effects on the fetus and newborn remain unknown, they added. ( COVID-19 patients face low risk of new heart failure Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may develop heart failure even if they do not have a previous history of heart disease or cardiovascular risk factors, although the risk is low, according to a study published on Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Among 6,439 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, doctors found 37 patients (0.6%) with no history of heart failure who developed new cases during their hospitalization - including eight in their 40s, on average, who had no previous cardiovascular disease or risk factors. It is not clear yet whether new-onset heart failure in these patients is an indirect effect of critical illness or a direct effect of the virus invading the heart, said study coauthor Dr. Anu Lala of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, in a statement. ""Importantly,"" she added, ""though symptoms of heart failure - particularly shortness of breath - can mimic symptoms associated with COVID-19, being alerted to the findings of this study may prompt clinicians to monitor for signs of congestion more consistent with heart failure than COVID-19 alone.""

The two billionaires, who have been trying to launch long-range orbital rockets, were competing for a coveted contract from the government to build a spaceship to deliver astronauts to the moon as early as 2024. Musk won. Bezos was not happy. Bezos' Blue Origin on Monday filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), accusing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of moving the goalposts for contract bidders at the last minute. Musk, who also leads SpaceX, fired back He did not elaborate on the tweet, but pasted a screenshot of a 2019 report about Bezos unveiling Blue Origin's moon lander on the same Twitter thread.

science,U.S. FCC approves SpaceX satellite deployment plan," WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said on Tuesday it had voted to approve a SpaceX plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned as part of its push to offer space-based broadband internet. Elon Musk's SpaceX had asked the FCC for approval to fly 2,824 satellites at a lower orbit as part of the plan to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access. The change in altitude would improve space safety, reduce power flux density emissions to improve the interference environment and lower ""elevation angles to improve the customer experience,"" SpaceX told the FCC. The FCC's decision to grant the approval, which Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday, includes a number of conditions to ensure the plan's safety. ""SpaceX?�s operations at lower altitudes and significant maneuverability should result in lower collision risk and an improved orbital debris environment,"" the FCC said. The FCC also said SpaceX agreed to accept that their lower-altitude satellites may encounter interference from satellites deployed under Amazon's Kuiper Systems satellite project. In July, Amazon Musk and Amazon have sparred publicly over the competing satellite plans. Amazon praised the FCC order for placing ""clear conditions on SpaceX, including requirements that it remain below 580 km and accept additional interference resulting from its redesign. These conditions address our primary concerns regarding space safety and interference."" SpaceX, which plans to eventually deploy 12,000 satellites in total, has said previously the Starlink constellation will cost it roughly $10 billion. While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach.

science,Genetic study offers good news for endangered Sumatran rhinoceros," April 26 (Reuters) - A genome study involving the last remaining populations of the Sumatran rhinoceros - a solitary rainforest dweller - is providing what scientists called good news about the prospects of saving this critically endangered species from extinction. The researchers said on Monday that their study found that the two existing wild populations of this rhino on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra boast unexpectedly good genetic health and surprisingly low levels of inbreeding. Experts estimate that only about 80 of the rhinos remain after a separate population on the Malaysian Peninsula went extinct in recent years. The Sumatran rhinoceros - the closest living relative to the woolly rhinoceros that was among the notable species of the last Ice Age - is known for its two small horns and a thin coat of reddish-brown hair. ""With such small population sizes, we were expecting much higher inbreeding in extant populations of Sumatran rhinoceros. So these findings were good news to us,"" said Nicolas Dussex, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden who helped lead the study published in the journal Nature Communications. ""Moreover, while the fate of the Malaysian population serves as a stark warning to what might happen to the two remaining populations on Sumatra and Borneo, our findings suggest that it may not be too late to find ways to preserve the genetic diversity of the species,"" Dussex said. The researchers sequenced the genomes of seven rhinos from Borneo, eight from Sumatra and six from the Malay Peninsula population that has been considered extinct since 2015. The Sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest of the world's five rhinoceros species, at around 1,540 to 1,760 pounds (700 to 800 kg). The elusive rainforest inhabitant, the most vocal rhino species, remains solitary except for mating and rearing offspring. It once had a wide range in Southeast Asia, from the foothills of the Himalayas down to Borneo and Sumatra. Poaching and habitation destruction by humans have devastated its population, with its numbers falling by about 70% over the past two decades. ""When it comes to long-term survival of a species, genetic diversity is one of the key factors, as this enables adaptation to future environmental changes and diseases,"" said Centre for Palaeogenetics doctoral student and study lead author Johanna von Seth. ""So, the fact that a lot of diversity remains is very promising if we can manage to maintain it, of course assuming we can also reduce the impact of non-genetic factors."" The researchers said steps such as translocating rhinos for mating - a costly and logistically challenging proposition - or using artificial insemination could enable a beneficial exchange of genes between the Borneo and Sumatra populations. This species has shown low reproductive success in captivity and faces a high risk of inbreeding - mating with close relatives - in the wild because of its small numbers. Inbreeding creates a heightened risk of genetic flaws and reduced genetic diversity. Scientists had feared that reports of tumors and low fecundity among these rhinos were evidence of a dangerously inbred population. ""It's important to remember that the Sumatran rhino is still on the verge of extinction due to non-genetic factors,"" said Centre for Palaeogenetics evolutionary genetics professor and study co-author Love Dalén. ""So the hope, though little, that these results offer is that if we manage to solve the problems caused by habitat destruction and poaching, there is at least a chance that the survivors will not be doomed by their poor genetic status,"" Dalén added.

science,EXCLUSIVE Space entrepreneur Max Polyakov acquires South Africa's Dragonfly satellite maker," SEATTLE, April 26 (Reuters) - Max Polyakov, an ultra-wealthy entrepreneur with ambitions of building a space transportation empire, has acquired South African satellite maker Dragonfly Aerospace, he told Reuters. The deal gives Polyakov an anchorpoint in the booming but fiercely competitive market for small-satellite technology, and a potential revenue source for rocket maker Firefly Aerospace, which is majority-owned by Polyakov's Noosphere Ventures investment fund. He declined to disclose the value of the deal, which closed earlier this month. It has not been previously reported. An announcement is expected on Tuesday. ""This deal gives us cost-control and mass production of components,"" Polyakov told Reuters by phone. ""It allows us to bring everything in-house."" The acquisition comes amid a frenzy of capital infusions and blank-check deal-making around a new breed of firms building miniaturized launch systems to cash in on the exponential growth of compact satellites needing a ride to orbit in the coming years. Texas-based Firefly is seeking to raise up to $350 million in multiple tranches over 12 months as part of a plan to expand production and bring to market its higher-capacity Beta rocket, two people familiar with the matter said. One of them told Reuters an announcement on an initial infusion could be made in the coming days. A Firefly spokesman declined to comment. Polyakov hopes Dragonfly's satellites could launch on Firefly's Alpha rocket, which Polyakov said could potentially debut before the end of June. Firefly, U.S.-New Zealand startup Rocket Lab and billionaire British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit are front-runners in a long list of small-launch providers seeking to cash in on the small satellite trend. The boom is fueled in part by venture cash and technology leaps that have reduced the size and boosted the capabilities of satellites used for everything from communications to national security to climate studies.

science,A black hole dubbed 'the Unicorn' may be galaxy's smallest one," WASHINGTON, April 22 (Reuters) - Scientists have discovered what may be the smallest-known black hole in the Milky Way galaxy and the closest to our solar system - an object so curious that they nicknamed it 'the Unicorn.' The researchers said the black hole is roughly three times the mass of our sun, testing the lower limits of size for these extraordinarily dense objects that possess gravitational pulls so strong not even light can escape. A luminous star called a red giant orbits with the black hole in a so-called binary star system named V723 Mon. The black hole is located about 1,500 light years - the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km) - from Earth. While it may be the closest one to us, it is still far away. By way of comparison, the closest star to our solar system, Proxima Centauri, is 4 light years away. Black holes like this one form when massive stars die and their cores collapse. ""We nicknamed this black hole 'the Unicorn' partly because V723 Mon is in the Monoceros constellation - which translates to unicorn - and partly because it is a very unique system"" in terms of the black hole's mass and relative closeness to Earth, said Ohio State University astronomy doctoral student Tharindu Jayasinghe, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. There are three categories of black holes. The smallest, like 'the Unicorn,' are so-called stellar mass black holes formed by the gravitational collapse of a single star. There are gargantuan 'supermassive' black holes like the one at our galaxy's center, 26,000 light years from Earth, which is four million times the sun's mass. A few intermediate-mass black holes also have been found with masses somewhere in between. ""It is clear that nature makes black holes of a wide range of masses. But a three-solar-mass black hole is a big surprise. There are no very good models for how to make such a black hole, but I am sure people will work on that more now,"" said Ohio State University astronomy professor and study co-author Kris Stanek. 'The Unicorn' falls into what the researchers called a ""mass gap"" between the largest-known neutron stars - objects similarly formed by a large star's collapse - at around 2.2 times the mass of our sun and what previously had been considered the smallest black holes at around five times the sun's mass. ""'The unicorn' is truly one of the smallest black holes possible,"" Jayasinghe said. Its strong gravity alters the shape of its companion star in a phenomenon known as tidal distortion, making it elongated rather than spherical and causing its light to change as it moves along its orbital path. It was these effects on the companion star, observed using Earth-based and orbiting telescopes, that indicated the black hole's presence. ""Black holes are electromagnetically dark, and so they are difficult to find,"" Jayasinghe said. Unlike some other black holes orbiting with a star, this one was not observed to be drawing material from its companion, which is 173 times more luminous than our sun. The only smaller potential black hole is one with a mass 2.6 times that of our sun that was spotted in another galaxy, Jayasinghe said. Another team of scientists last year described a black hole roughly 1,000 light years from Earth, but other researchers have questioned whether it is a black hole.

science,NASA extracts breathable oxygen from thin Martian air," LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Reuters) - NASA has logged another extraterrestrial first on its latest mission to Mars: converting carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere into pure, breathable oxygen, the U.S. space agency said on Wednesday. The unprecedented extraction of oxygen, literally out of thin air on Mars, was achieved Tuesday by an experimental device aboard Perseverance, a six-wheeled science rover that landed on the Red Planet Feb. 18 after a seven-month journey from Earth. In its first activation, the toaster-sized instrument dubbed MOXIE, short for Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, produced about 5 grams of oxygen, equivalent to roughly 10 minutes' worth of breathing for an astronaut, NASA said. Although the initial output was modest, the feat marked the first experimental extraction of a natural resources from the environment of another planet for direct use by humans. ""MOXIE isn't just the first instrument to produce oxygen on another world,"" Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations within NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. She called it the first technology of its kind to help future missions ""live off the land"" of another planet. The instrument works through electrolysis, which uses extreme heat to separate oxygen atoms from molecules of carbon dioxide, which accounts for about 95% of the atmosphere on Mars. The remaining 5% of Mars' atmosphere, which is only about 1% as dense Earth's, consists primarily of molecular nitrogen and argon. Oxygen exists on Mars in negligible trace amounts. But an abundant supply is considered critical to eventual human exploration of the Red Planet, both as a sustainable source of breathable air for astronauts and as a necessary ingredient for rocket fuel to fly them home. The volumes required for launching rockets into space from Mars are particularly daunting. According to NASA, getting four astronauts off the Martian surface would take about 15,000 pounds (7 metric tons) of rocket fuel, combined with 55,000 pounds (25 metric tons) of oxygen. Transporting a one-ton oxygen-conversion machine to Mars is more practical than trying to haul 25 tons of oxygen in tanks from Earth, MOXIE principal investigator Michael Hecht, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in NASA's news release. Astronauts living and working on Mars would require perhaps one metric ton of oxygen between them to last an entire year, Hecht said. MOXIE is designed to generate up to 10 grams per hour as a proof of concept, and scientists plan to run the machine at least another nine times over the next two years under different conditions and speeds, NASA said. The first oxygen conversion run came a day after NASA achieved the historic first controlled powered flight of an aircraft on another planet with a successful takeoff and landing of a miniature robot helicopter on Mars. Like MOXIE, the twin-rotor chopper dubbed Ingenuity hitched a ride to Mars with Perseverance, whose primary mission is to search for fossilized traces of ancient microbes that may have flourished on Mars billions of years ago.

science,Russia plans to launch own space station after quitting ISS," MOSCOW, April 21 (Reuters) - Russia is ready to start building its own space station with the aim of launching it into orbit by 2030 if President Vladimir Putin gives the go-ahead, the head of its Roscosmos space agency said on Wednesday. The project would mark a new chapter for Russian space exploration and an end to more than two decades of close cooperation with the United States aboard the ageing International Space Station (ISS). ""If in 2030, in accordance with our plans, we can put it into orbit, it will be a colossal breakthrough,"" Interfax news agency quoted Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin as saying. ""The will is there to take a new step in world manned space exploration."" Russian cosmonauts have worked with counterparts from the United States and 16 other countries about the ISS since 1998 - one of the closest fields of cooperation between Moscow and Washington, whose relations are currently in deep crisis over human rights, cyberattacks and a range of other issues. Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told Russian TV at the weekend that Moscow would give notice to its partners that it would leave the ISS project from 2025. Rogozin said the Russian station, unlike the ISS, would most likely not be permanently crewed because its orbit path would expose it to higher radiation. But cosmonauts would visit it and it would also use artificial intelligence and robots. He said Russia was ready to consider allowing foreign crews to visit, ""but the station must be national... If you want to do well, do it yourself."" Interfax quoted an unnamed source as saying that Russia planned to spend up to $6 billion to get the project launched.

science,"EU should make better use of its space assets, auditors say"," BRUSSELS, April 21 (Reuters) - The European Union has not done enough to capitalise on its 18 billion euro ($21.6 billion) space programmes, including its Galileo satellite positioning system and Copernicus observation satellites, EU auditors said on Wednesday. The European Court of Auditors (ECA) found that the EU had failed to spell out the societal and economic benefits of its space programmes, or set clear targets or timeframes to achieve those benefits. ""Technologically, the EU has succeeded in becoming a global player in terms of space-based earth observation and navigation services. But the EU lacks a comprehensive approach for supporting the uptake of its space services to fully capitalise on the significant public investment made,"" said Mihails Kozlovs, the ECA member responsible for the report. The EU has spent 18.3 billion euros up to the end of 2020 and has earmarked more than 14 billion euros for the 2021-2027 period. The biggest share of that investment is on Copernicus and Galileo, the two flagship satellite systems. Copernicus was put to good use monitoring some EU policies, in agriculture, climate and maritime surveillance for example, the auditors said. But EU-wide use of its observation data remains restricted to scientists and experts, even though access to it was improved. The Galileo programme, which has 26 satellites in orbit to provide an alternative to the U.S. GPS positioning system, was initially delayed by eight years when it began operating in 2016. The auditors said progress had been made in introducing Galileo-compatible receivers, allowing it to be used in smartphones or cars. But it still lags the U.S. GPS system, and auditors said it will take time until Galileo is used more widely.

science,"Keeping up with T. Rex was easy, Dutch researchers say"," THE HAGUE, April 21 (Reuters) - Unlike its popular movie incarnations, Tyrannosaurus rex - the giant meat-eating dinosaur from the Cretaceous period - walked slower than previously thought, most likely ambling around at human walking speed, new Dutch research found. Working with a 3-dimensional computer model of ""Trix"", a female T. rex skeleton at the Dutch Naturalis museum, researcher Pasha van Bijlert added computer reconstructions of muscles and ligaments to find that it's likely that the dinosaur's preferred speed was 4.61 kms (2.86 miles) an hour, close to the walking pace of humans and horses. In an article on the movement of dinosaurs in the Royal Open Society Science journal, Van Bijlert and his co-authors said T. rex's huge tail played an important part in its locomotion. They looked at how the animal would achieve a natural frequency of movement, factoring in not only leg muscles as in previous studies but also tail movement, that would minimize the amount of energy used. ""The tail would sway up and down with each step (like a giraffe's neck). If the step rhythm and tail natural frequency were matched, the tail would resonate, maximizing energy storage,"" Van Bijlert said on Twitter. By calculating the T. Rex's step rhythm researchers estimated its walking speed. However, it's too soon to assume a human could have outrun a T. rex: the researchers said they were looking at the fearsome predator's walking pace and still researching its possible top speeds. There's also no possibility of it being put to the test as the species died out more than 60 million years before people appeared on Earth.

science,Scientists hope genetic engineering can revive the American chestnut tree," April 22 (Reuters) - A day before Earth Day, retired forester Rex Mann watched as scientists signed an agreement with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina to allow for the eventual planting of genetically engineered American chestnut trees on tribal land. Mann, who has heard countless stories about the American chestnut tree that once dominated the Appalachia region, was emotional as he witnessed the signing. ""My dad loved the tree... and he understood what it meant to the way of life of these people in the mountains,"" the 76-year-old from Kentucky said. ""That way of life died with the tree."" In the early 20th century, a blight is believed to have wiped out some four billion chestnut trees that once grew across the eastern United States, from Maine to Georgia. Now, American chestnut advocates, like Mann, and a small network of scientists are hoping to restore the trees by genetically engineering a blight-resistant tree. Several experiments have been tried over the years, but so far scientists believe the greatest promise comes from a transgenic tree ??engineered with a gene from wheat ??known as Darling 58. They also hope that this initiative will encourage similar projects for other species. ""There's a number of species where invasive insects and pathogens have been imported into this country,"" said Jared Westbrook, director of science at the American Chestnut Foundation. ""All the tools that we're using ??the breeding, the biotechnology, the genomics... could be used as a kind of a model for these other tree species."" Currently scientists are not allowed to grow transgenic trees outside of private greenhouses. The U.S. government is reviewing the researchers' request for deregulation status, which would allow the scientists to plant the trees in forests. The project is not without opponents. Several organizations have signed on to the Campaign to Stop GE (Genetically Engineered) Trees. They argue that introducing such trees into the ecosystem could have unintended consequences for other plant and animal species. But Mann thinks it is a way of giving back to the Earth. ""The stark choice we face is either embrace this cutting-edge science and use it wisely or bid our native forests goodbye, and for the sake of our grandkids, we can't afford to do that,"" he said.

science,SpaceX rocketship launches 4 astronauts on NASA mission to space station," April 23 (Reuters) - NASA and Elon Musk?�s commercial rocket company SpaceX launched a new four-astronaut team on a flight to the International Space Station on Friday, the first crew ever propelled into orbit by a rocket booster recycled from a previous spaceflight. The company's Crew Dragon capsule Endeavour, also making its second flight, streaked into the darkened pre-dawn sky atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as its nine Merlin engines roared to life at 5:49 a.m. (0949 GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The blast-off from Cape Canaveral was aired live on NASA TV. The crew is due to arrive at the space station, orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, early on Saturday following a flight of about 23 hours. On the way they will have time to dine on pre-packaged meals and snacks and to get some sleep. Within 10 minutes of launch, the rocket's second stage had delivered the crew capsule to Earth orbit, traveling at nearly 17,000 miles per hour, according to launch commentators. The rocket's first stage, meanwhile, descended back to Earth and touched down safely on a landing platform floating in the Atlantic on a drone ship affectionately named Of Course I Still Love You. The mission marks the second ""operational"" space station team launched by NASA aboard a Crew Dragon capsule since human spaceflights resumed from American soil last year, following a nine-year hiatus at the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011. It is also the third crewed flight launched into orbit in 11 months under NASA's fledgling public-private partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company founded in 2002 by Musk, who is also CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc The first was an out-and-back test mission carrying just two astronauts into orbit last May, followed by SpaceX's maiden flight of a full-fledged four-member space station crew in November. ""The future's looking good. I think we're at the dawn of a new era of space exploration,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said at a briefing with NASA officials after watching the liftoff from launch control. Friday's Crew 2 team consists of two NASA astronauts - mission commander Shane Kimbrough, 53, and pilot Megan McArthur, 49 - along with Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, 52, and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet, 43, a French engineer from the European Space Agency. A video camera mounted inside the crew capsule showed the four helmeted astronauts, dressed in white flight suits and black boots, seated side by side at the controls of the capsule early in their journey. About two hours later, relaxing in their weightless environment, they hosted a brief tour of the cabin for NASA TV's audience. ""The ride was really smooth, and we couldn't have asked for anything better,"" McArthur said. ""Hope you enjoyed the show."" Pesquet held the camera up to one of the capsule's windows, giving viewers a glimpse of Madagascar from orbit. LONG-DURATION MISSION They are expected to spend about six months aboard the orbiting research platform conducting science experiments and maintenance before returning to Earth. The four members of Crew 1, sent to the space station in November, are slated to fly home on April 28. The Crew 2 mission made a bit of spaceflight history due to the fact that its Falcon 9 rocket blasted off with the same first-stage booster that lofted Crew 1 into orbit five months ago, marking the first time a previously flown booster has ever been re-used in a crewed launch. Reusable booster vehicles, designed to fly themselves back to Earth and land safely rather than fall into the sea after launch, are at the heart of a re-usable rocket strategy that SpaceX helped pioneer to make spaceflight more economical. SpaceX has logged dozens of Falcon 9 booster return landings, and the company has refurbished and re-used most of them, some for multiple flights. But all of those flights, until Friday's mission, only carried cargo. Crew 2's pilot, McArthur, made a bit of history herself as the first female pilot of the Crew Dragon and the second person from her family to ride aboard the SpaceX capsule. She is married to NASA astronaut Bob Behnken, who flew the SpaceX demonstration flight with fellow astronaut Doug Hurley last year. The same Crew Dragon was used for that flight as well. If all goes well, Crew 2 will be welcomed aboard the space station Saturday by the four Crew 1 astronauts - three from NASA and one from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA. Two Russian cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to the space station are also aboard.

science,Robots to fan out across world's oceans to monitor their health," MOSS LANDING, California, April 21 (Reuters) - After years studying the icy waters of the Southern Ocean with floating robotic monitors, a consortium of oceanographers and other researchers is deploying them across the planet, from the north Pacific to the Indian Ocean. The project known as the Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Array, or GO-BGC, started in March with the launch of the first of 500 new floating robotic monitors containing computers, hydraulics, batteries and an array of sensors scientists say will relay a more comprehensive picture of the ocean and its health. ""The ocean is extremely important to the climate, to the sustainability of the earth, its supply of food, protein to enormous numbers of people. We don't monitor it very well,"" said Ken Johnson, GO-BGC's project director and a senior scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in Moss Landing, California. Johnson said the sensors help survey a larger portion of the ocean more consistently than people collecting samples on ships, adding, ""The goal is to be able to monitor the health of the ocean in places where people only go once a decade."" At the MBARI lab, team members have been busy calibrating each of the sensors, which will measure acidity, or pH levels, salinity, temperature, pressure, oxygen and nitrate. The measurements will be taken at a depth of 3,280 feet (1,000m), where the float will drift in weaker currents for a little over a week. The float will then descend to 6,500 feet before surfacing and transmitting its data to shore via satellite. The entire trip will take about 10 days. That data will be made available to research institutions and schools for free, and will help lead to better oceanic modelling, said George Matsumoto, a senior education and research specialist at MBARI. ""Over the years as all the data starts to accumulate, we're learning more and more about the oceans,"" he said.

Antiviral remdesivir appears safe for children The antiviral drug remdesivir appears to be as safe and effective for use in children with COVID-19 as in adults, according to the largest study to date of children with severe COVID-19 who received the drug. Remdesivir, sold by Gilead Sciences Inc Patients may not pose highest COVID-19 risk for hospital staff U.S. healthcare workers on the frontlines of the pandemic who become sick with COVID-19 are more likely to have acquired the infection in the community than through patient care, new research suggests. At a major Wisconsin medical center, researchers investigated likely sources of infections by analyzing the gene sequences of the virus obtained on swab samples from 95 healthcare workers and their patients. Only 11% of participants' infections could be traced to a coworker and only 4% to a patient, the researchers reported in Clinical Infectious Diseases. They said their observations align with recent studies evaluating healthcare-associated infections in the Netherlands and in the UK, and with another recent study that found the most important risk factor for COVID-19 was the rate of the disease in surrounding communities, not workplace factors. ""It appears that healthcare personnel most commonly become infected with SARS-CoV-2 via community exposure,"" the researchers conclude.

There's lots of studies showing it's in our water, it's in our food products,"" said Scott Wilson, research director of the Australian Microplastic Assessment Project (AUSMAP). ""There's a good chance all of us will have some type of microplastic in our bodies at some stage - the question is what harm is that having?"" The widespread use of inexpensive disposable products has surged in the last 50 years and AUSMAP estimates approximately 12 million metric tonnes of plastic seep into oceans around the world every year. But since plastic is not biodegradable, it breaks down into smaller pieces over time. These fragments -- known as microplastic -- have even been found in some of the most remote of locations, including the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench - the deepest place on Earth - and in ice cores in the Arctic. Little is known about how harmful microplastics are, Wilson said. A 2019 study by conservation group WWF International concluded that people could be ingesting the equivalent of a credit card of plastic a week. A pressing need to establish how widespread and harmful they are prompted dozens of amateur scientists to sign up to help AUSMAP. ""If this is going to help find answers as to how we can prevent it getting it there and maybe cleaning up what's there, then it's worth doing. It's definitely worth doing,"" said Sarah Cook, a Sydney resident who is one of the volunteers scanning for microplastic.

science,NASA scores Wright Brothers moment with first helicopter flight on Mars," LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Reuters) - NASA scored a 21st-century Wright Brothers moment on Monday as it sent its miniature robot helicopter Ingenuity buzzing above the surface of Mars for nearly 40 seconds, marking the first powered controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet. Officials at the U.S. space agency hailed the brief flight  of the 4-pound (1.8-kg) rotorcraft as an achievement that would help pave the way for a new mode of aerial exploration on Mars and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus and Saturn's moon Titan. The debut flight of Ingenuity, resembling a large metallic tissue box with four legs and a twin-rotor parasol, was documented in full-color video by cameras aboard the science rover vehicle Perseverance, which carried the helicopter to the Red Planet two months ago. Mission managers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles burst into applause and cheers as data beamed back from Mars confirmed the solar-powered helicopter had performed its maiden 39-second flight three hours earlier, precisely as planned. ""We can now say that human beings have flown an aircraft on another planet,"" said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at JPL, during a NASA livestream of the flight confirmation. Altimeter readings from the rotorcraft showed it became airborne at 3:34 a.m. EDT (0734 GMT), climbed as programmed to a height of 10 feet (3 meters), then hovered steadily in place over the Martian surface for half a minute while pivoting 96 degrees before making a firm but safe touchdown, NASA said. FROM KITTY HAWK TO MARS ""That's what we told Ingenuity to do, and it did exactly that,"" Havard Grip, Ingenuity's chief pilot at JPL, told a post-flight briefing. He called the flight ""flawless."" NASA likened the achievement to the Wright Brothers' first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in December 1903 - a takeoff and landing that covered just 120 feet (37 meters) in 12 seconds. ""This is really a Wright brothers moment,"" acting NASA chief Steve Jurczyk said at the briefing. Early images included a black-and-white still photo taken by a downward-pointing onboard camera while the helicopter was aloft, showing the distinct shadow cast by Ingenuity in the Martian sunlight onto the ground below it. A separate camera mounted on Perseverance, parked about 200 feet away, captured video of the rotorcraft's entire flight against the butterscotch-colored landscape surrounding it. Despite the flight's brevity and less-than-soaring altitude, it marked an historic feat in interplanetary aviation, taking place on an ""air field"" 173 million miles from Earth on the floor of a vast Martian basin called Jezero Crater. In honor of the modest but monumental first human flight 117 years ago at Kitty Hawk, NASA officially designated Ingenuity's flight zone as Wright Brothers Field, a location recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization in a certificate issued to NASA for the occasion. NASA also paid tribute to the Wrights by affixing a tiny swatch of wing fabric from their original flyer under Ingenuity's solar panel before sending it off to Mars. 'PUSHING THE ENVELOPE' The tiny rotorcraft hitched a ride to the Red Planet strapped to the belly of Perseverance, a six-wheeled astrobiology lab that landed in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18 after a nearly seven-month journey through space. Ingenuity's chief engineer, Bob Balaram, said the aircraft was doing great after its first flight. But NASA officials were less than sentimental about the fate facing their beloved Martian whirligig. JPL plans to press the aircraft to its brink with four more flights going farther, faster and higher over the next two weeks, they said. The first is targeted for Thursday. ""We will be pushing the envelope,"" Aung said. ""And ultimately we expect the helicopter will meet its limits."" Ingenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, separate from Perseverance's primary mission to search for traces of ancient microorganisms and collect Martian rock samples. That mission will continue after Ingenuity's demise. Building a helicopter to fly on Mars was tall order for JPL. While Mars possesses much less gravity to overcome than Earth, its atmosphere is just 1% as dense, making it especially difficult to generate aerodynamic lift. To compensate, engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger (4 feet long) and spin far more rapidly than would be needed on Earth. The design was successfully tested in vacuum chambers simulating Martian conditions, but the concept remain unproved until Ingenuity took flight Monday on the fourth planet from the sun. Because of the enormous distances involved, Ingenuity was designed to execute pre-programmed flight instructions autonomously, using advanced onboard pilot and navigation systems. The small, lightweight aircraft also had to withstand punishing overnight Martian temperatures dropping as low as minus 130 Fahrenheit (minus 90 Celsius), using solar power alone to recharge and keep internal components properly heated. The first flight was delayed a week by a technical glitch, but NASA resolved the issue by transmitting additional flight sequence commands last week.

science,A rediscovered forgotten species brews promise for coffee's future," April 19 (Reuters) - In dense tropical forests in Sierra Leone, scientists have rediscovered a coffee species not seen in the wild in decades - a plant they say may help secure the future of this valuable commodity that has been imperiled by climate change. The researchers said on Monday that the species, called Coffea stenophylla, possesses greater tolerance for higher temperatures than the Arabica coffee that makes up 56% of global production and the robusta coffee that makes up 43%. The stenophylla coffee, they added, was demonstrated to have a superior flavor, similar to Arabica. Botanist Aaron Davis, who led the study published in the journal Nature Plants, said stenophylla was farmed in parts of West Africa and exported to Europe until the early 20th century before being abandoned as a crop after robusta's introduction. Many farmers throughout the world's coffee-growing belt already are experiencing climate change's negative effects, an acute concern for the multibillion dollar industry. Arabica's flavor is rated as superior and brings higher prices than robusta, which is mainly used for instant coffee and coffee blends. But Arabica has limited resilience to climate change and research has shown its global production could fall by at least 50% by mid-century. Stenophylla grows at a mean annual temperature of 24.9 degrees Celsius (76.8 degrees Fahrenheit) - 1.9 degrees C (3.42 degrees F) higher than robusta coffee and up to 6.8°C (12.24 degrees F) higher than Arabica coffee, the researchers said. The stenophylla rediscovery, Davis said, may help in the ""future-proofing"" of a coffee industry that supports the economy of several tropical countries and provides livelihoods for more than 100 million farmers. While 124 coffee species are known, Arabica and robusta comprise 99% of consumption. ""The idea is that stenophylla could be used, with minimum domestication, as a high-value coffee for farmers in warmer climates,"" said Davis, head of coffee research at Britain's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""For the longer term, stenophylla provides us with an important resource for breeding a new generation of climate-resilient coffee crop plants, given that it possesses a great flavor and heat tolerance. If the historic reports of resistance to coffee leaf rust and drought tolerance are found to be correct, this would represent further useful assets for coffee plant breeding,"" Davis added. Leaf rust is a fungal disease that has devastated coffee crops in Central and South America. The study included flavor assessments involving 18 coffee-tasting experts. Stenophylla was found to have a complex flavor profile, with natural sweetness, medium-high acidity, fruitiness and good ""body"" - the way it feels in the mouth. In December 2018, Davis and study co-authors Jeremy Haggar of the University of Greenwich and coffee development specialist Daniel Sarmu searched for stenophylla in the wild. They initially spotted a single plant in central Sierra Leone. About 140 km (87 miles) away in southeastern Sierra Leone, they found a healthy wild stenophylla population. ""Both locations were thick tropical forest, but stenophylla tends to occur on drier, more open areas: ridges, slopes and rocky areas,"" Davis said. Stenophylla had not been seen in the wild in Sierra Leone since 1954 and anywhere since the 1980s in Ivory Coast, Davis said. A few examples were held in coffee research collections. Davis said stenophylla is threatened with extinction amid large-scale deforestation in the three countries where it has been known to grow in the wild: Sierra Leone, Guinea and Ivory Coast. Unlike the red and occasionally yellow fruit of Arabica and robusta plants, stenophylla's fruit are intense black. The coffee beans are inside the fruit. ""I think we're hugely optimistic for the future that stenophylla can bring,"" said Jeremy Torz, co-founder of the specialty coffee business Union Hand-Roasted Coffee in East London where part of the taste-testing was held.

science,Three astronauts return from International Space Station," MOSCOW, April 17 (Reuters) - Three members of the International Space Station's crew returned safely to Earth on Saturday on a Russian Soyuz craft, Russia's Roscosmos space agency reported. The Soyuz MS-17 spacecraft carrying NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, a microbiologist who in 2016 became the first person to sequence DNA in space, and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov landed in Kazakhstan at 0455 GMT. The three had been at the space station since mid-October 2020. Their mission was the last scheduled Russian flight carrying a U.S. crew member, marking an end to a long dependency as the U.S. revives its own crew launch capability in an effort to drive down the cost of sending astronauts to space. Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,"'NASA rules,' Musk says as SpaceX wins $2.9 billion moon lander contract"," WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - NASA awarded billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to build a spacecraft to bring astronauts to the moon as early as 2024, the agency said on Friday, picking it over Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics Inc. Bezos and Musk - the world's first and third richest people respectively, according to Forbes - were competing to lead humankind's return to the moon for the first time sine 1972. Musk's SpaceX bid alone while Amazon.com ""NASA Rules!!"" Musk wrote on Twitter after the announcement. The U.S. space agency awarded the contract for the first commercial human lander, part of its Artemis program. NASA said the lander will carry two American astronauts to the lunar surface. ""We should accomplish the next landing as soon as possible,"" Steve Jurczyk, NASA's acting administrator, said during the video conference announcement. ""If they hit their milestones, we have a shot at 2024,"" Jurczyk added. NASA said SpaceX's Starship includes a spacious cabin and two airlocks for astronaut moon walks and that its architecture is intended to evolve to a fully reusable launch and landing system designed for travel to the Moon, Mars and other destinations in space. SpaceX also responded on Twitter, writing, ""We are humbled to help @NASAArtemis usher in a new era of human space exploration."" Unlike the Apollo landings from 1969 to 1972 - the only human visits to the moon's surface - NASA is gearing up for a longer-term lunar presence that it envisions as a steppingstone to an even more ambitious plan to send astronauts to Mars. NASA is leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration. SpaceX will be required to make a test flight of the lander to the moon before humans make the journey, NASA official Lisa Watson-Morgan told reporters. NASA had been expected to winnow the lunar lander contest to two companies by the end of April, but instead it picked only SpaceX, a move that deepens their cooperation. On Thursday, NASA said it would send its crew to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket on April 22. The agency aims to create regular service to the moon and said it will have a separate competition for that contract. ""We have to be able to provide for recurring lunar services,"" said Mark Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems division. The announcement added to an extraordinary run for Musk, who has turned electric car maker Tesla Inc. Musk has become a one-person technology conglomerate, launching or controlling companies pursuing space flight, electric cars, neural implants and subterranean tunnel boring. A factor in the choice of SpaceX was ""what's the best value to the government,"" said Kathy Lueders, associate administrator for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. NASA said in a news release that SpaceX's HLS Starship, designed to land on the moon, ""leans on the company's tested Raptor engines and flight heritage of the Falcon and Dragon vehicles."" NASA's decision was a setback for Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast who is now more focused on his space venture after having announced in February he would step down as Amazon CEO. The contract was seen by Bezos and other executives as vital to Blue Origin establishing itself as a desired partner for NASA, and also putting the venture on the road to turning a profit. Musk has outlined an ambitious agenda for SpaceX and its reusable rockets, including landing humans on Mars. But in the near term, SpaceX's main business has been launching satellites for Musk's Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo. SpaceX announced on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16 billion in equity financing. An uncrewed SpaceX Starship prototype rocket failed to land safely on March 30 after a test launch from Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship was one in a series of prototypes for the heavy-lift rocket being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars. A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year's end. Our Standards: New Caledonia's Prony Resources said on Wednesday Tesla Inc had agreed to purchase more than 42,000 tonnes of nickel in a multi-year deal - a pact that is set to make it a key supplier of the metal to the U.S. electric car maker."
science,Scientists find only 3% of land areas unblemished by humans," SINGAPORE, April 17 (Reuters) - Very little of today?�s world resembles Planet Earth from 500 years ago. In fact, only about 3% of land surfaces might be ecologically intact -- still home to their full range of native species and unblemished by human activity, according to new research. The finding -- published Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change -- is far lower than previous estimates based on satellite images, which suggested around 20% to 40% of land ecosystems were undamaged. For the new study, however, scientists conducted an extensive survey of forest cover and species losses to understand better what was happening beneath the world?�s tree canopies. ""I was particularly surprised to see how low it really is,"" said Andrew Plumptre, a conservation biologist at the University of Cambridge. ""It shows how rare such intact places are. It's scary just how little the world looks like what it was just 500 years ago."" The term ecosystem describes the complex relationships within a natural area that, altogether, help to sustain a healthy and balanced diversity of life. Lose just one or two key species, and the whole system could fall apart. Today?�s still-pristine habitats, containing the same species abundance as in the year 1500 A.D., were mostly found in regions considered less hospitable for humans, including the Sahara Desert and chilly regions of Greenland and northern Canada. Other intact habitats were in areas under extreme pressure from deforestation and development, including parts of the Amazon in Latin America. The authors argue that these areas should be a priority for future conservation. Though currently, only 11% of these areas are under protection, the study found. ""The idea of focusing on intact areas is so that you don?�t have to work to remove the human footprint,"" Plumptre said. Some scientists, however, questioned the extremely low figure, saying it could be attributed to the study using a particularly narrow definition of ""intact habitats"" -- those with their full, historical collection of animals and plants. ""We need practical actions to ensure species and ecosystems survive,"" said Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University. He also questioned the study authors' call for protecting still-intact areas, noting frozen or desert patches are not the most abundant with species. ""Encouraging nations to protect remote, sparsely populated areas won't do biodiversity a lot of good,"" Pimm said. An effort led by the United Nations to protect 30% of the planet?�s land and waters by 2030 - up from about 17% currently under some form of protection - has gained momentum over the last year, as governments including the United States have pledged to commit more land to conservation. Some conservationists argue, however, that the world?�s conservation goal should be much higher than 30% in order to prevent mass die-offs of species. A 2019 U.N. report estimated as many as 1 million species are under threat of extinction due to human activity. ??0 by 30 is a nice catchphrase, but it won?�t do much good if the areas to be protected are not selected carefully,??Pimm said.

science,"?�Like Godzilla, but actually real?? study shows T. rex numbered 2.5 billion"," WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - If one Tyrannosaurus rex - the school bus-sized meat-eating dinosaur that stalked the Cretaceous Period landscape - seems impressive, how about 2.5 billion of them? Researchers on Thursday unveiled the first calculation of the total T. rex population during the estimated 2.4 million years that this fearsome species inhabited western North America during the twilight of the age of dinosaurs. They considered factors including the size of its geographic range, its body mass, growth pattern, age at sexual maturity, life expectancy, duration of a single generation and the total time that T. rex existed before extinction 66 million years ago. They also heeded a doctrine called Damuth's law linking population to body mass: the bigger the animal, the fewer the individuals. Their analysis put the total number of T. rex individuals that ever existed at about 2.5 billion, including approximately 20,000 adults alive at any one time. Fossils of more than 40 T. rex individuals have been found since it was first described in 1905, providing a wealth of information about a beast that thrives in the popular imagination. ""Why iconic?"" asked paleontologist Charles Marshall, who led the study published in the journal Science. ""Heck, a hugely massive killer with super-huge teeth, one that you would never dream up on your own if we didn't have the fossil record. So not only super-cool and beyond the imagination, but real. Like Godzilla, but actually real. And I think we like feeling small, and T. rex sure makes us feel small and vulnerable,"" Marshall said. It was among the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, possessing a skull about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, massive and muscular jaws with a bite force capable of crushing bone, a mouthful of banana-sized serrated teeth, a keen sense of smell, strong legs and puny arms with hands boasting just two fingers. Perhaps the largest-known T. rex is a specimen named Sue at the Field Museum in Chicago, measuring 40-1/2-foot-long (12.3-meters), weighing an estimated 9 tons and living about 33 years. The new study put the weight of the average adult T. rex at 5.2 tons, average lifespan at 28 years, generation time at 19 years, total number of generations of the species at about 125,000, and its geographic range at roughly 890,000 square miles (2.3 million square kilometers). They calculated an average population density of about one T. rex for every roughly 40 square miles (100 square kilometers). T. rex fossils have been found in Canada's Alberta and Saskatchewan provinces and the U.S. states of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. T. rex apparently met a fiery end when an asteroid slammed into Mexico, exterminating three quarters of Earth's species. While the uncertainties in the estimates were large and some of the assumptions may be challenged by other paleontologists, the study was a worthwhile effort to expand the understanding of this famous dinosaur, said Marshall, director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology and a University of California, Berkeley professor of integrative biology. The formula could be applied to other extinct animals, Marshall added. Paleontologist and study co-author Ashley Poust of the San Diego Natural History Museum said while 2.5 billion is a lot, it represents only about a third of Earth's current human population - and 20,000 is merely the size of a small town. ?�They?�d have to meet up over possibly long distances to mate, or maybe even care for their young,??Poust said of Tyrannosaurus. ?�The numbers can seem big and cold, but I guess I see them as a pretty intimate window into their lives.??Our Standards: Three months after billionaire U.S. businessman Jeff Bezos soared into space aboard a rocketship built by his Blue Origin company, the craft is set on Wednesday to take another all-civilian crew on a suborbital ride, this time with ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner in the lead role."
science,EXCLUSIVE New zinc-fortified wheat set for global expansion to combat malnutrition," MEXICO CITY, April 15 (Reuters) - Scientists at a leading global grains research institute expect to sharply ramp up new wheat varieties enriched with zinc that can boost the essential mineral for millions of poor people with deficient diets, the institute?�s head told Reuters. Martin Kropff, director general of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), said he expects the newly-developed high-zinc wheat to make up at least 80% of varieties distributed worldwide over the next ten years, up from about 9% currently. The Mexico-based institute's research focuses on boosting yields, and livelihoods, of the world's poorest farmers while also addressing specific challenges posed by climate change, including higher temperatures, less rainfall and constantly mutating plant diseases. The improved varieties of so-called biofortified wheat are being rolled out with the help of seed company partners in countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Bolivia. Kropff said Asian giant China may also begin adopting the fortified wheat varieties this year. Over the next decade, he said he expects nearly all newly deployed wheat varieties to be nutritionally improved, noting that the high-zinc varieties were developed by traditional breeding techniques instead of research based on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ""This is something that is really starting in a big way this year,"" said Kropff, who also pointed to CIMMYT-developed zinc-enhanced corn that was introduced in Colombia over the past two years. ""I'm super proud of this,"" he added, touting the seeds ability to dent malnutrition via one of the world's grains staples. The dramatic expansion of the new wheat varieties, which has not been previously reported, holds the promise of improving diets that lack essential minerals like zinc and iron, used to fight off viruses and move oxygen throughout the body. Zinc deficiency, in particular, is one of the main causes of malnutrition globally and estimated to afflict more than 2 billion people. CIMMYT scientists, with a research budget last year of $120 million, have developed about 70% of wheat varieties currently planted globally as well as about half of the world's corn, or maize, varieties. The vast majority of CIMMYT's research is non-GMO. The institute was founded by 1970 Nobel peace prize winner Norman Borlaug and runs research projects in some 50 countries. It has attracted funding from the U.S. and British governments, among others, as well as billionaires like Bill Gates and Carlos Slim. 'FIRST OF ITS KIND' CORN Kropff also cited three recently-developed CIMMYT corn varieties that are resistant to Fall Armyworm (FAW), an insect that has caused major damage to crops in both Africa and Asia, that were bred in Kenya with the help of CIMMYT's maize seed bank in Mexico, the world's largest. ""Like people, (the worms) like maize as well, but they eat the leaves and also the grains and it's really terrible,"" said Kropff. The new varieties will be distributed over the next few months for performance trials in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe, according to CIMMYT officials. Kropff, a 64-year-old Dutch scientist, said the FAW-resistant corn varieties are the first of their kind and have already been picked for trials in east African nations ahead of similar trails expected in southern Africa later in the year. He said CIMMYT, which in a typical year develops and deploys some 35 improved wheat varieties globally, fills a space that the biggest profit-maximizing seed companies like Germany's Bayer AG ""We specifically breed varieties for those environments where the private sector cannot make much money,"" he said, explaining that the poorest farmers must also regularly adopt new varieties that can thrive in a world where pests and disease are constantly evolving too. ""The small-holder farmers rely on us.""

science,Mars helicopter flight test promises Wright Brothers moment for NASA," LOS ANGELES, April 18 (Reuters) - NASA hopes to score a 21st-century Wright Brothers moment on Monday as it attempts to send a miniature helicopter buzzing over the surface of Mars in what would be the first powered, controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet. Landmark achievements in science and technology can seem humble by conventional measurements. The Wright Brothers' first controlled flight in the world of a motor-driven airplane, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903 covered just 120 feet (37 meters) in 12 seconds. A modest debut is likewise in store for NASA's twin-rotor, solar-powered helicopter Ingenuity. If all goes to plan, the 4-pound (1.8-kg) whirligig will slowly ascend straight up to an altitude of 10 feet (3 meters) above the Martian surface, hover in place for 30 seconds, then rotate before descending to a gentle landing on all four legs. While the mere metrics may seem less than ambitious, the ""air field"" for the interplanetary test flight is 173 million miles from Earth, on the floor of a vast Martian basin called Jezero Crater. Success hinges on Ingenuity executing the pre-programmed flight instructions using an autonomous pilot and navigation system. ""The moment our team has been waiting for is almost here,"" Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung said at a recent briefing at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles. NASA itself is likening the experiment to the Wright Brothers' feat 117 years ago, paying tribute to that modest but monumental first flight by having affixed a tiny swath of wing fabric from the original Wright flyer under Ingenuity's solar panel. The robot rotorcraft was carried to the red planet strapped to the belly of NASA's Mars rover Perseverance, a mobile astrobiology lab that touched down on Feb. 18 in Jezero Crater after a nearly seven-month journey through space. Although Ingenuity's flight test is set to begin around 3:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday (0730 GMT Monday), data confirming its outcome is not expected to reach JPL's mission control until around 6:15 a.m. ET on Monday. NASA also expects to receive images and video of the flight that mission engineers hope to capture using cameras mounted on the helicopter and the Perseverance rover, which will be parked 250 feet (76 meters) away from Ingenuity's flight zone. If the test succeeds, Ingenuity will undertake several additional, lengthier flights in the weeks ahead, though it will need to rest four to five days in between each to recharge its batteries. Prospects for future flights rest largely on a safe, four-point touchdown the first time. ""It doesn't have a self-righting system, so if we do have a bad landing, that will be the end of the mission,"" Aung said. An unexpectedly strong wind gust is one potential peril that could spoil the flight. NASA hopes Ingenuity - a technology demonstration separate from Perseverance's primary mission to search for traces of ancient microorganisms - paves the way for aerial surveillance of Mars and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus or Saturn's moon Titan. While Mars possesses much less gravity to overcome than Earth, its atmosphere is just 1% as dense, presenting a special challenge for aerodynamic lift. To compensate, engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger (4-feet-long) and spin more rapidly than would be needed on Earth for an aircraft of its size. The design was successfully tested in vacuum chambers built at JPL to simulate Martian conditions, but it remains to be seen whether Ingenuity will fly on the red planet. The small, lightweight aircraft already passed an early crucial test by demonstrating it could withstand punishing cold, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as 130 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius), using solar power alone to recharge and keep internal components properly heated. The planned flight was delayed for a week by a technical glitch during a test spin of the aircraft?�s rotors on April 9. NASA said that issue has since been resolved.

The UAE is using its space programme to develop its scientific and technological capabilities and reduce its reliance on oil. The Gulf state?�s, and the Arab world?�s, first interplanetary probe The Rashid lunar rover will be designed entirely by Emiratis. The UAE had originally intended to send it into space by 2024. Japanese company ispace, founded in 2010, aims to provide commercial transportation to the moon with a wider mission to ultimately incorporate the moon into the earth's economy. The 2022 launch will be ispace's first mission of this kind and will use a Falcon 9 rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX, to be launched from Florida. Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center (MBRSC) will build the Rashid lunar rover. It will remain on the moon after data collection is completed, said Emirates Lunar Mission manager Hamad al-Marzooqi. The SpaceX rocket will deliver an ispace lander to the moon's orbit. The lander will propel itself to the moon's surface and the UAE rover will then emerge from the lander and drive off to explore, said ispace Founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada. The lander will also be carrying a solid-state battery designed by Japanese company NGK Spark Plug The lunar mission is part of the Gulf state's broader vision for a Mars settlement by 2117.

science,Listen to the music of a spider?�s web. Tell me what do you hear?," April 13 (Reuters) - It is an eerie, foreboding, reverberating tune, enough to send a tingle down your spine. This is what a spiderweb sounds like. From communication to construction, spiderwebs may offer an orchestra of information, says Markus Buehler, engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been using artificial intelligence to study them. ""Spiders utilize vibrations as a way to communicate with the environment, with other spiders,"" he said. ""We have recorded these vibrations from spiders and used artificial intelligence to learn these vibrational patterns and associate them with certain actions, basically learning the spider's language."" Buehler and his team of researchers created 3D models of spiderwebs when the arachnids were doing different things - such as construction, repair, hunting and feeding. They then listened for patterns in the spider signals and recreated the sounds using computers and mathematical algorithms. ""Spiders are a whole different animal,"" said Buehler. ""What they see or sense isn't actually audible or visible to the human eye or the human ear. And so by transposing it, we begin to experience that."" Buehler hopes his team's work could enable humans to understand the language of a spider and one day communicate with them. ""The melodies are really the kind of relationships that the spider would also experience. And so we can begin to feel a little bit like a spider in that way,"" Buehler said. There are more than 47,000 species of spiders, and all spin silk webs to provide housing and catch food. Scientists say the silk from a spiderweb is five times stronger than steel. The living structure of a spiderweb could lead to innovations in construction, maintenance and repair, Buehler said. ?�We can imagine creating a synthetic system that would mimic what the spider does in sensing the web, repairing the web,??he said.

science,Autoimmune-disease drugs may reduce vaccine response; antibody treatments ineffective vs Brazil variant," April 12 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Autoimmune disease treatments may reduce vaccine responses Immunosuppressive drugs for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and ulcerative colitis can impair the body's response to the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech Most antibody drugs ineffective against Brazil variant The coronavirus variant first identified in Brazil, known as P.1, is resistant to three of the four antibody therapies with emergency use authorization in the United States, according to a laboratory study. In test-tube experiments, researchers exposed the P.1 variant to various monoclonal antibodies, including the four currently being used to treat U.S. COVID-19 patients - imdevimab and casirivimab from Regneron Pharmaceuticals South Africa variant can 'break through' Pfizer vaccine The B.1.351 coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa can ""break through"" Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine protection to some extent, Israeli researchers have found. They compared almost 400 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 after one or two doses of the vaccine, against the same number of similar people with COVID-19 who were unvaccinated. The prevalence of the variant in Israel is low, and overall, it accounted for about 1% of all the COVID-19 cases in the study. But among those who received both doses of the vaccine, a larger proportion of COVID-19 infections were caused by B.1.351. The ""disproportionately higher rate"" of the South African variant in the fully vaccinated group (5.4%) compared to the rate in the unvaccinated group (0.7%) ""means that the South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccine's protection,"" said Tel Aviv University's Adi Stern. In a report posted on Friday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, Stern's team said the research was not intended to deduce overall vaccine effectiveness against any variant, since it only looked at people who had already tested positive for COVID-19, not at overall infection rates in the community.

Moderna vaccine antibodies last at least 6 months A follow-up study of 33 people who received Moderna Inc?�s Lung transplants can save some COVID-19 survivors Surgeons worldwide have been performing lung transplants in COVID-19 survivors with irreversible lung damage, and an international group of transplant experts has proposed guidelines for selection of eligible patients. To possibly qualify for a transplant, COVID-19 survivors with complete lung failure should be younger than 65, nonsmokers, and have no pre-existing medical conditions, or only manageable ones, they advise. They said transplants should be performed at least four weeks after a diagnosis of irreversible lung damage. In the United States alone, more than 50 double lung transplants have been performed on COVID-19 survivors, and all the patients are alive, said Dr. Ankit Bharat of Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, who has performed a dozen of them. A study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine that examined 12 of the first double-lung transplants performed in COVID-19 patients in the United States, Italy, Austria and India showed that all but two  survived and are doing well, said co-author Bharat.

Fewer than half of patients who experienced a delayed skin reaction after the first dose experienced a recurrence with the second dose. Furthermore, no patients in the registry developed serious adverse events after the first or second dose. ""If the patient develops a delayed-onset rash more than four hours after vaccination, while the rash may be uncomfortable, our data suggest they ... should feel comfortable proceeding with the second dose of their vaccine,"" Freeman said. However, she added, hives that start within four hours after vaccination ""should be taken very seriously,"" as that may be a sign of an immediate allergic reaction. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends referral to an allergist-immunologist in those cases.

science,Beast of five teeth: Chilean scientists unearth skunk that walked among dinosaurs," SANTIAGO, April 8 (Reuters) - A fossil of a skunk-like mammal that lived during the age of dinosaurs has been discovered in Chilean Patagonia, adding further proof to recent evidence that mammals roamed that part of South America a lot earlier than previously thought. A part of the creature's fossilized jawbone with five teeth attached were discovered close to the famous Torres del Paine national park. Christened Orretherium tzen, meaning 'Beast of Five Teeth' in an amalgam of Greek and a local indigenous language, the animal is thought to have lived between 72 and 74 million years ago during the Upper Cretaceous period, at the end of the Mesozoic era, and been a herbivore. Prior to its discovery, and the teeth of the Magallanodon baikashkenke, a rodent-like creature, in the same area last year, only mammals living between 38 and 46 million years ago had been found in the southernmost tip of the Americas, the team that discovered it said. The finds are critical to completing the evolutionary puzzle of the Gondwanatheria, a group of long-extinct early mammals that co-existed with dinosaurs, said Sergio Soto, a University of Chile paleontologist. ""This and other discoveries that we are going to make known in the future are revealing that there is enormous potential in terms of paleontology in the southern tip of Chile,"" said Soto. ""We are finding things that we did not expect to find and that are going to help us answer a lot of questions that we had for a long time about dinosaurs, mammals and other groups."" The discovery was published in the journal Scientific Reports by experts from the University of Chile working with researchers from Argentina's Natural History and La Plata museums and the Chilean Antarctic Institute. The scientists think Orretherium tzen cohabited with Magallanodon baikashkenke, which was thought to have been an evolutionary step between a platypus or marsupial, and dinosaurs such as the long-necked titanosaur.

science,Bulgarian cave remains reveal surprises about earliest Homo sapiens in Europe," April 7 (Reuters) - DNA extracted from remains found in a Bulgarian cave of three people who lived roughly 45,000 years ago is revealing surprises about some of the first Homo sapiens populations to venture into Europe, including extensive interbreeding with Neanderthals and genetic links to present-day East Asians. Scientists said on Wednesday they sequenced the genomes of these three individuals - all males - using DNA obtained from a molar and bone fragments discovered in Bacho Kiro Cave near the town of Dryanovo, as well as one female who lived roughly 35,000 years ago at the same site. Our species first appeared in Africa approximately 300,000 years ago and later trekked to other parts of the world, sometimes encountering Neanderthals - our close cousins - already inhabiting parts of Eurasia. The three Bacho Kiro Cave males represent the oldest securely dated Homo sapiens individuals from Europe. They had 3% to 3.8% Neanderthal DNA, and had Neanderthal ancestors about five to seven generations back in their family histories, evidence of interbreeding, said geneticist Mateja Hajdinjak of the Francis Crick Institute in London, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature. Interbreeding, known as admixture, between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals before the extinction of Neanderthals sometime after 40,000 years ago has been previously shown, with present-day human populations outside Africa bearing a small percentage of Neanderthal DNA. The prevalence of this interbreeding and the relationship and power dynamics between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals has been harder to understand - including any role our species played in the demise of the Neanderthals. The new study suggests interbreeding was more common than previously known for the first Homo sapiens in Europe. It is an ""amazing observation"" that all three individuals had Neanderthal ancestors in their recent family history, said geneticist and study co-author Svante Pääbo, director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. ""This makes it likely that the earliest modern humans frequently mixed with Neanderthals when they met. It may even be the case that part of the reason Neanderthals disappeared is that they were simply absorbed into larger modern human groups. It may be just part of the reason they disappeared but the data supports such a scenario,"" Pääbo said. The researchers detected a genetic contribution among present-day people from the group that included these three, but unexpectedly it was found particularly in East Asia, including China, rather than Europe. This suggested that some people from this group eventually headed east. ""This study shifted our previous understanding of early human migrations into Europe in a way that it showed how even the earliest history of modern humans in Europe may have been tumultuous and involved population replacements,"" Hajdinjak said. The notion of population replacement was illustrated by the fact that the 35,000-year-old individual from Bacho Kiro Cave belonged to a group genetically unrelated to the site's earlier inhabitants. Another study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution shed more light on Europe's early Homo sapiens populations. Scientists sequenced the genome of a Homo sapiens female using DNA extracted from a skull found at a site southwest of Prague in the Czech Republic. She is believed to have lived more than 45,000 years ago, though radiocarbon dating efforts to determine a firm date were unsuccessful. This woman carried 3% Neanderthal ancestry and bore genetic traits suggesting she had dark skin and dark eyes, said geneticist Kay Prüfer of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the study's lead author. ""Her skull shows evidence of gnawing by a predator, possibly a hyena,"" Prüfer said. Her group, distinct from the one in Bulgaria, appears to have died out without leaving genetic ancestry among modern-day people.

science,Shrinking sea meadows store more carbon than forests. Scientists are racing to track what?�s left," SAYA DE MALHA BANK, Indian Ocean, April 8 (Reuters) - Hundreds of miles from the nearest shore, ribbon-like fronds flutter in the ocean currents sweeping across an underwater mountain plateau the size of Switzerland. A remote-powered camera glides through the sunlit, turquoise waters of this corner of the western Indian Ocean, capturing rare footage of what scientists believe is the world?�s largest seagrass meadow. Human activity is helping destroy the equivalent of a soccer field of these seagrasses every 30 minutes around the world, according to the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP). And scientists are now racing to take stock of what remains. ""There are a lot of unknowns -- even things as simple as how much seagrass we have,"" said Oxford University earth observation scientist Gwilym Rowlands, who is helping the Seychelles government map the island nation?�s seagrass and estimate how much carbon it stores. ""If you look at the map data for seagrass, there are huge holes"" in what we know. Seagrasses play a large role in regulating ocean environments, storing more than twice as much carbon from planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) per square mile as forests do on land, according to a 2012 study in the journal Nature Geoscience. Countries that hope to earn credit toward bringing down their CO2 emissions could tally their seagrasses and the carbon they store, a first step toward accrediting carbon offsets for eventual trading on an open market. The grasses also curb the acidity of surrounding waters -- an especially important function as the ocean absorbs more CO2 from the atmosphere and becomes more acidic. But seagrasses provide some buffer from acidification, which can damage animals??shells and disrupt fish behaviours. In one study published March 31 in the journal Global Change Biology, scientists at the University of California, Davis, found that seagrasses dotted along the California coast could reduce local acidity by up to 30% for extended periods. The plants also help clean polluted water, support fisheries, protect coasts from erosion, and trap micro-plastics, said the study's lead author Aurora Ricart. ""What is even cooler is that these habitats are present everywhere,"" she said. SEAGRASS AS CLIMATE ALLY While most seagrasses fringe coastlines around the world, the shallowness of Saya de Malha allows sunlight to filter to the seabed, creating an aquatic prairie in the Indian Ocean that provides shelter, nurseries and feeding grounds for thousands of marine species. The bank?�s isolation has helped protect it from coastal threats, including pollution and dredging. But even such remote stretches of international waters face increasing incursions from shipping and industrial fishing. In March, scientists from institutions including Britain?�s Exeter University travelled with Greenpeace on an expedition to collect some of the first field data on the area?�s wildlife, including its little-studied beds of seagrass. With the boat bobbing for days above the plateau, the researchers gathered bits of grass floating in the water, tweezering them into bottles for analysis back on shore. Data on seagrass meadows are patchy, but research so far estimates the grasses cover over 300,000 square km (115,000 square miles), distributed across all continents apart from Antarctica, according to UNEP. That would be an area the size of Italy. It is not yet known how much carbon is locked into Saya de Malha, but globally the tangled roots of seagrasses are estimated to trap over 10% of the carbon buried in ocean sediment per year. ""This has massive implications for the (world?�s) climate change mitigation efforts,"" said Dimos Traganos, lead scientist on a German Aerospace Center project developing software to improve seagrass tracking using satellite imagery and other data. That effort has been helped by recent advances in cloud computing and data storage, he said. ""We are in such an exciting period."" Seagrass meadows are believed to be retreating around 7% per year globally, according to the most recent seagrass census published in a 2009 study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It notes the estimate was based on incomplete data available at the time. The more closely studied areas illustrate the harm human activity can cause. Pollution from mining and damage by fisheries may have helped to eliminate 92% of mainland Britain's seagrasses in over a century, according to a March 4 study in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science. If still intact, these could have supported around 400 million fish and stored up to 11.5 million tonnes of carbon -- equivalent to 3% of Britain's CO2 emissions in 2017, the study said. This year, Seychelles began assessing its coastal seagrass carbon stock for the first time, and at least 10 countries have said seagrasses would play a part in their climate action plans, according to UNEP. Seychelles and Mauritius, which have joint jurisdiction over the Saya de Malha?�s seabed, should count up and care for the wealth of seagrass on their shared doorstep, said James Michel, who served 12 years as president of the Seychelles until 2016. ?�Then we?�ll be in a better position to know how to not only preserve it, but also to manage it to ensure that it is protected for the future.??Our Standards: Over 700 residents were ordered to abandon their homes on Tuesday on the Spanish island of La Palma as red-hot lava advanced towards their neighbourhood."
science,Climate change shrinks marine life richness near equator - study," HAVANA, April 5 (Reuters) - During some summers, as the Caribbean water temperatures climb, the luminous coral colonies of gold, green and blue that ring the island nation of Cuba give way to patches of skeletal white. The technicolor streaks of darting tropical fish flash less frequently. The rasping sounds of lobsters go quiet. While Cuba?�s marine life has suffered from overfishing and pollution, there is mounting evidence that the warming of waters due to climate change may be taking a large toll as well -- both off the island's coast and globally. Research published Monday finds that the total number of open-water species declined by about half in the 40 years up to 2010 in tropical marine zones worldwide. During that time, sea surface temperatures in the tropics rose nearly 0.2 degree Celsius. (Study: ""Climate change is already impacting marine species diversity distribution,"" with changes being more dramatic in the Northern Hemisphere where waters have warmed faster, said study co-author Chhaya Chaudhary, a biogeographer at Goethe University. While numerous factors like overfishing have impacted tropical species, the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found a strong correlation between species decline and rising temperature. Fish species diversity tended to either plateau or decline at or above 20C (68 Fahrenheit), the researchers found. 'BLINK OF AN EYE' While past studies have shown that ocean warming is driving some species to migrate to cooler waters, the new study attempts to gauge that impact more broadly -- analyzing data on 48,661 marine species including fish, mollusks, birds and corals since 1955. (Data source: The dataset is a representative sample of 20% of all named open-water and seabed-dwelling marine species - like corals and sponges, researchers said. The number of species attached to the seafloor remained somewhat stable in the tropics between the 1970s and 2010, according to the study. Some were also found beyond the tropics, suggesting they had expanded their ranges. In other words, scientists say, species that can move are moving. ""In geological history, this has occurred in the blink of an eye,"" said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research who was not involved with the study. ""To see such changes occurring so rapidly is something quite alarming."" For fixed species like corals, moving is not an option. ""One of the big questions is ?�Will coral reefs as ecosystems and corals as species be able to move north or south enough fast enough to adjust to a changing climate??? Ferse said. CUBA?�S CORALS Having fleets of fish and other swimmers shift rapidly to more temperate waters could devastate the coral ecosystems they leave behind -- along with any fishing and tourism industries that rely on them. Such changes ?�can have a really huge impact on some of the most vulnerable human communities around the planet"

Four attendees had COVID-19-like symptoms that day. Of the 46 coronavirus infections linked to the party, there were 26 cases among patrons, three in staff members and 17 ""secondary cases"" in people infected by them, according to a report published on Monday in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The secondary cases included children and residents of long-term care facilities. ""Transmission associated with the opening event resulted in one school closure affecting 650 children (9,100 lost person-days of school) and hospitalization of one long-term care facility resident with COVID-19,"" researchers said. ""These findings demonstrate that opening up settings such as bars, where mask wearing and physical distancing are challenging, can increase the risk for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"" researchers said. Businesses should ""work with local health officials to promote behaviors and maintain environments that reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and develop strategies for reopening safely to prevent outbreaks in the community, such as modifying layouts and operating procedures,"" they said. ( Congenital heart disease does not worsen COVID-19 risks Adults with congenital heart defects are not more likely than the average person to have severe COVID-19, or to die from it, according to an international study. Risk factors associated with poor outcomes in these individuals are the same as those associated with poor outcomes in the general public - older age, male gender, a history of heart failure, irregular heart rhythm, kidney problems, diabetes, and need for extra oxygen before becoming infected with the coronavirus, said study coauthor Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn of the UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Center. Researchers analyzed data from 1,044 adults with COVID-19 from 58 congenital heart disease centers worldwide. Even people with very complex heart defects did not appear to have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 as long as they did not already have severe signs and symptoms of heart disease, Aboulhosn said, calling the finding, ""somewhat surprising."" The study was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ( Stroke patients with COVID-19 have worse outcomes Among patients who went to a hospital because they were having a stroke, those who tested positive for COVID-19 had higher odds of dying there, a new study shows. The patients with COVID-19 were also more likely to have more severe stroke and to suffer another stroke while hospitalized, researchers reported in the journal Stroke. They studied close to 42,000 patients who arrived at 458 hospitals with ischemic stroke, caused by blockages in arteries that carry blood to the brain. About 3% of the patients tested positive for COVID-19. On average, they got to the hospital as quickly as patients without coronavirus infection. After that, things slowed down. ""Likely due to the need for personal protective equipment use and other precautions"" by hospital staffers, it took longer for COVID-19 patients to get clot-busting treatments that reopen the clogged vessels, said study coauthor Dr. Gregg Fonarow of the University of California, Los Angeles. The study cannot prove that treatment delays caused the worse outcomes. However, Fonarow said, ""these findings suggest there is a need to further enhance stroke protocols to provide more timely diagnosis and treatment for patients with (ischemic stroke) to speed care while still protecting healthcare workers from exposure.""

science,"On Gagarin flight anniversary, Putin vows Russia will remain space power"," MOSCOW, April 12 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin marked the 60th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's historic space flight on Monday with a pledge that Moscow would remain a key space and nuclear power. Gagarin became the first human in outer space on April 12, 1961, in one of the Soviet Union's most important Cold War victories and a pivotal moment in its space race with the United States. The Soviet Union's achievements in space continue to be a source of national pride and a patriotic rallying cry at a time when Moscow's relations with Washington are at a post-Cold War low. To mark the anniversary, Putin laid flowers on a monument to Gagarin near his landing site close to the city of Engels, some 860 km (535 miles) southeast of Moscow. ""This is without a doubt a great event that changed the world. We will always be proud that it was our country that paved the road to outer space,"" Putin told senior officials. ""In the 21st century, Russia must properly maintain its status as one of the leading nuclear and space powers, because the space sector is directly linked to defence."" Gagarin's 108-minute orbit around the Earth propelled him to international fame and earned him the status of national hero in the Soviet Union, which erected statues and painted murals in his honour across its vast territory. The head of Russian space agency Roscosmos and members of the Communist Party laid flowers on Gagarin's grave at the foot of the Kremlin wall on Monday. Other commemorative events were more light-hearted, including a neighbourhood clean-up in the Siberian city of Irkutsk where volunteers dressed up as characters from Star Wars. Celebrations also took place in space. ""Our scientists and engineers demonstrated the unquestionable superiority of our homeland's technology, and made us the (world's) first space power,"" cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky said in a video address from the International Space Station (ISS), flanked by three other Russian cosmonauts. Roscosmos has suffered a series of technical mishaps and corruption scandals in recent years, including during the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the country's far east where contractors were accused of embezzling state funds. In 2019, Putin complained to government officials about corruption at the facility, and investigators said they were looking into allegations of fraud.

science,Scientists call for new probe into COVID-19 origins - with or without China," SHANGHAI, April 8 (Reuters) - A joint China-World Health Organization (WHO) study into COVID-19 has provided no credible answers about how the pandemic began, and more rigorous investigations are required - with or without Beijing's involvement, a group of international scientists and researchers said on Wednesday. The joint study, released last week, said the likeliest transmission route for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, involved bats and other wildlife. It all but ruled out the possibility it had leaked from a laboratory. In an open letter, 24 scientists and researchers from Europe, the United States, Australia and Japan said the study was tainted by politics. ""Their starting point was, let's have as much compromise as is required to get some minimal cooperation from China,"" said Jamie Metzl, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, who led the drafting process for the letter. The study's conclusions were based on unpublished Chinese research, while critical records and biological samples ""remain inaccessible"", the letter said. Claims by WHO Director General Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus that China has withheld data have been rejected by Liang Wannian, China's senior COVID-19 expert. Liang also appeared to rule out any further joint investigations in China. Metzl said the world might have to ""revert to Plan B"" and conduct further investigations without China's involvement. China has rejected allegations that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a research laboratory in Wuhan, the city where COVID-19 was first identified. The joint China-WHO study said the lab leak theory was ""extremely unlikely"", saying there was ""no record"" that any laboratory had kept SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. Tedros said more research was required to ""reach more robust conclusions"". But Metzl said China should disclose information that would allow the lab-leak hypothesis to be disproved. ""China has databases of what viruses were being held... there are lab notes of the work that was being done,"" he said. Responding to the letter on Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said its ""purpose was self-evident"" and that countries like the United States, not China, were guilty of politicising the inquiry into COVID-19's origins. ""They insist on politicising the issue of traceability, damaging and disrupting China's cooperation with the WHO, discrediting China and publicly challenging the independence and scientific conclusions of scientists,"" he said.

wealth,EXCLUSIVE U.S. SEC opens inquiry into Wall Street banks' staff communications -sources," WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. SEC enforcement staff contacted multiple banks in recent weeks to check whether they have been adequately documenting employees' work-related communications, such as text messages and emails, with a focus on their personal devices, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The industry ""sweep"" is a further sign that the SEC is ramping up enforcement under its Democratic leadership, and highlights the challenges Wall Street banks face keeping track of staff communications in the work-from-home pandemic era. The SEC periodically conducts sweeps to quickly gather information on issues it suspects may be widespread. Sweeps can sometimes, although not necessarily, lead to formal probes. The sweep appears to stem from a probe the agency has been conducting for some time into an individual financial institution, two of the sources said, without naming the firm. In August, JPMorgan Chase & Co Spokespeople for the SEC and JPMorgan declined to comment. The SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulatory body, require broker-dealers to keep records of all business-related communications. Banks have to walk a fine line to comply with those requirements without infringing upon employees' privacy, said one of the sources. In the United States, there is no clear-cut legal basis on which an employer can demand to inspect employees' personal communications, while in other countries doing so may breach data protection statutes, the source said. As a result, many financial firms ban the use of personal email, texts and other social media channels for work purposes, but keeping up with a proliferation of communication apps -- especially during the pandemic -- is a challenge for companies. In a Failure to retain and produce communication records can impede regulatory investigations, Grewal said in the remarks. Last year, Morgan Stanley"
wealth,U.S. IPO boom braves market volatility," Oct 11 (Reuters) - Weeks of stock market volatility have done little to dent the record-setting pace of U.S. initial public offerings, with capital market insiders forecasting a strong finish to the year and a robust pipeline of listings in 2022. More than 2,000 IPOs raised a combined $421 billion globally by the end of September, a record high, as private companies rushed to attain the soaring valuations of their publicly listed peers. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data. Four IPOs were withdrawn or postponed in the United States in the last three weeks, according to Dealogic. Uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling, the financial woes of Chinese property developer Evergrande and spiraling energy prices and inflation fueled wild swings in the stock market, making it more difficult for companies to price their stock market debuts. Still, U.S. IPOs proved more resilient than those in Europe, where seven listings were pulled. With U.S. lawmakers agreeing last week to postpone the debt ceiling issue for two months and investors coming to grips with the Chinese property market's jitters, IPO bankers and lawyers said most companies were keeping their listing plans on track. ""We see not only new deals coming to the market, we see existing engagements continuing to move forward,"" said Marc Jaffe, managing partner of law firm Latham & Watkins' New York office. In the last three weeks, IFIT Health & Fitness Inc IPO hopefuls that braved the market volatility were rewarded by investors, albeit less than they previously expected. Shares of U.S. companies that went public in the last four weeks have gone up 25.5% on average, compared with a 42% rise in value for those that went public this time about four months ago, according to Dealogic. Jim Cooney, head of Americas equity capital markets at Bank of America Corp ""Investors have narrowed the scope of investments to consider given overall muted performance in the secondary market,"" Cooney said. Among the biggest high-profile IPOs expected by the end of the year are those of electric vehicle market Rivian Automotive and chipmaker GlobalFoundries.

wealth,"U.S. banks expected to report mixed Q3 results, iffy loan outlook"," Oct 7 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. lenders are expected to report moderately higher third-quarter profits next week as pandemic-related accounting adjustments that had doubled their earnings earlier this year taper off and business starts to return to normal. Analysts, on average, expect JPMorgan Chase & Co Next Thursday, Citigroup Inc Goldman Group Inc Stock buybacks will provide a lift to earnings-per-share in the quarter and coming periods. Investment banking divisions should deliver spectacular gains thanks to a record-breaking boom in takeovers, while a decline in fixed-income trading revenue will be partially offset by strong equity volumes. But analysts say the focus will be on whether net interest revenue, which provides more than half of banking industry revenue but has been stagnant in recent quarters, is set to rise in coming months on higher interest rates and new loan demand from businesses and consumers. ""That's going to be the question. It is the heart of the business for everybody,"" said Gerard Cassidy, analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Some banks could show they are earning more interest because they started investing more of their excess cash in securities, such as 5-year U.S. Treasury notes which were recently yielding 1%, three times as much as at the start of the year. Analysts will also look for signs that commercial and industrial borrowing has stopped declining. They expect an  increase once COVID-hampered supply chains recover and allow businesses to build inventories that need bank financing. Many businesses and consumers paid down loans during the pandemic. Bank of America's 35% expected jump in profits is likely to be driven by smaller provisions for loan losses and a rise in net interest income. Its results may suggest its strategy of investing its excess cash in government and mortgage-backed securities has paid off. Unlike earlier this year, banks will benefit only marginally this quarter from releasing reserves for pandemic-related loan losses that did not materialize. Banks have already released 60% of a combined $50 billion of reserves they had put aside and will likely release only $5 billion more this quarter, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden. He expects Wells Fargo and Citigroup will feel the greatest benefit. Results for those two banks could also be influenced by how much they are having to spend to comply with orders from regulators to improve their controls. Wells Fargo's year-earlier profits were hurt by costs for making amends to customers for wrongs. M&A FEES, TRADING Takeover advisory fees at the big investment banks will be up by 80% on average, Cassidy said, adding that he also expects a lift from equity underwriting. Trading revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be down about 10% on average because fixed income markets, which drove record trading volumes last year, have settled down to more normal levels. JPMorgan third-quarter net income is expected to decline about 3% from a year earlier on lower trading revenue and higher expenses, according to the average analyst estimate. Results from investment banking giant and money manager Morgan Stanley are expected to rise on higher takeover advisory fees, stronger equities trading revenue and more wealth management fees. Goldman Sachs is also expected to benefit from higher  mergers and acquisitions fees amid the biggest global deals boom on record.

wealth,Bank of America raises U.S. minimum hourly wage to $21," Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp Bank of America in May disclosed plans to raise its minimum wages for its U.S. employees, joining a clutch of firms that have pledged to pay employees more after a year of pandemic risks and government subsidies fueled conversations on whether companies pay their workers enough. The $25 figure is higher than at competitors, and the second-largest U.S. bank has also asked its vendors to set a minimum wage of $15 an hour. In the last four years, Bank of America raised the minimum hourly wage to $20 from $15. Companies have sometimes been prodded to boost wages by employee complaints that spill into the public sphere.

wealth,What to watch for market stress as the U.S. debt ceiling deadline nears," NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Worries about the debt ceiling are beginning to rattle investors as the deadline nears for Congress to raise the U.S. borrowing limit to avoid a historic default on U.S. debt. With two weeks before the Oct. 18 deadline, President Joe Biden said Monday he cannot guarantee the government will not breach its $28.4 trillion debt limit unless Republicans join Democrats in voting to raise it. Concerns are mounting in the market for short-term bills, credit default spreads on U.S. debt and in general market sentiment. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government will run out of cash around that date unless Congress raises the limit on the federal debt. ""The debt ceiling and infrastructure talks out of (Washington), D.C., will continue to be front and center this week amid more hints that ratings agencies could take the U.S. credit rating down a notch if the drama continues,"" said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. SHORT-TERM TREASURY SPREADS There are signs of tension in the Treasury bill market, with 1-month bills that would be affected by a potential default yielding higher than 3-month bills. One-month bills  currently yield 0.1%, close to their highest levels since March on an intraday basis, compared with a 0.038% yield in three-month bills . The spread between one-month and three-month bills is the widest since March 2020. Portfolio managers typically avoid bill issues at risk of default even if the likelihood of a failed payment is very low. This can send yields on some issues higher than those on longer-dated debt, an unusual occurrence in the yield curve, which is typically upward-sloping. U.S. REPO MARKET Except for some minor volatility, the U.S. overnight repurchase agreement (repo) market has shown little signs of stress. Overnight repo rates on Monday closed at 0.05% . There were some pockets of volatility, traders said, in the last few days. Last week, overnight repo rates traded as high as 0.07%, but fell as low as -0.10%. As the debt ceiling deadline looms, repo rates have become volatile because with the U.S. Treasury expected to run down its cash balance, the excess funds flow into the banking system as reserves. Banks can either choose to invest in the repo market, which pushes rates lower, or lend to the Federal Reserve via its reverse repo facility. That takes money away from the repo market and tends to lift overnight rates a little higher. ""Except for perhaps some elevated volatility, I don't see anything outsized at this point that makes me think it's resulting from increased angst about the debt ceiling,"" said Dan Belton, fixed-income strategist, at BMO Capital in Chicago. Rates in the repo market are also affected at certain dates of the month by inflows from government state enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Last Thursday, volume at the Fed's reverse repo window soared to a record $1.604 trillion, as investors flocked to the U.S. central bank facility where they are paid a guaranteed 5 basis for overnight cash without counterparty risk. OPTIONS MARKET When investors are anxious about an upcoming event, they typically load up on options hedges, thereby driving up volatility embedded in those options. Options on S&P 500 A more significant rise in volatility for expirations on and around the Oct. 18 deadline in coming days would tell that the debt ceiling showdown is garnering more attention from investors. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS Thinly traded credit default swaps  that would pay off in the case of a U.S. government default have spiked in recent days, though they remain far below where they traded during the summer of 2011 when prolonged debt ceiling negotiations led to ratings agencies downgrading U.S. debt, according to Moody's analytics. One-year credit-default swaps are now trading at levels last seen in December 2020, according to Refinitiv data, through remain approximately 40% lower than they were in March 2020 when much of the U.S. economy shutdown during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. MONEY MARKET FLOWS In one sign of rising nervousness, investors sent approximately $33 billion into money-market funds the week that ended Sept. 29. That move to cash pushed the total assets of the $3.9 trillion money market industry to its highest levels since June, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.

wealth,Stablecoins to face same safeguards as traditional payments," LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Stablecoins would have to comply with the same safeguards as their more traditional competitors in payments under proposals from regulators on Wednesday as authorities get to grips with a rapidly evolving sector. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value relative to traditional currencies, or to a commodity such as gold, to avoid the volatility that makes bitcoin and other digital tokens impractical for most commerce. Facebook Inc's Since then, Diem has radically scaled back its ambitions and plans to launch a U.S. dollar stablecoin. The IOSCO group of securities regulators and the Bank for International Settlements, a global forum for central banks, set out on Wednesday how current rules for major clearing, settlement and payments services should also be applied to 'systemic' or heavily used stablecoins. The proposals, put out to public consultation before being finalised early next year, put into practice what regulators have long called for: the same rules for the same type of business and accompanying risks. The rules mean a stablecoin operator must set up a legal entity which spells out how it is governed and manages operational risks like cyber attacks. Though still little-used for commerce, the use of stablecoins in crypto trading has grown rapidly as retail and larger investors warmed to the emerging asset class during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tether, the largest stablecoin, has a market capitalisation of around $68 billion versus just $15 billion a year ago. The value of circulating USD Coin, another major stablecoin, has also jumped dramatically to over $30 billion from just $2.7 billion a year ago, according to CoinMarketCap. Countries that allow stablecoins to operate would be required to apply the principles as part of their affiliation to IOSCO and the BIS. ""This report marks significant progress in understanding the implications of stablecoin arrangements for the financial system and providing clear and practical guidance on the standards they need to meet to maintain its integrity,"" IOSCO Chair Ashley Alder said in a statement. The proposals do not cover issues specific to stablecoins pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, which are being considered separately.

wealth,"Banks make slow progress on UK gender pay, while gap widens for insurers"," LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Major banks in Britain made a slight dent in their gender pay gaps last year, according to a Reuters analysis, though industry observers say they still have a long way to go. Several insurers went backwards. Companies in Britain with more than 250 employees have been required to publish the difference between the pay and bonuses of their male and female employees since 2017. They got a reprieve last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic - though many still filed data - and had an extra six months to publish data for 2019/2020. The deadline is Oct. 5. The financial services sector has typically shown one of the largest gender pay gaps in Britain, often attributed to a lack of women in senior jobs. Reuters collated pay gap data from 21 major financial institutions, which showed a narrowing in their average mean gender pay gap of just 0.4 percentage points to 33.4% in the year to April 2020, from 33.8% in 2019. Banks alone had a pay gap which narrowed by one percentage point. The mean average gender pay gap for all UK employers in the year ending April 2019 was 14.6%. ""The UK's financial services industry has often been singled out,"" said Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute. ""It really does have to get its house in order - the industry is a huge employer in the UK and it has a real opportunity to lead by example."" Goldman Sachs had the widest gender pay gap in the year to April 2020 among the companies surveyed by Reuters, though the gap narrowed more than at other banks compared with a year earlier. Goldman posted a gender pay gap of 51.8%, a tightening of 1.4 percentage points. The bank told staff in a memo in April that narrowing the gap further was a ""critical priority"" and its firmwide goal was to have 40% representation of women at vice president level by 2025. ""There is clearly more still to be done,"" a spokesperson for banking lobby group UK Finance said, adding many of its members had committed to the government's Women in Finance Charter. FTSE 100 insurers Prudential Prudential's UK gender pay gap widened to 45.2% from 40.3%, which the Asia-focused insurer attributed in its latest gender pay gap report at least in part to the spin-out of its UK life insurer and asset manager M&G in 2019. However, M&G also reported a widening in its pay gap in the most recent year, to 30.5% from 25%. ""We are determined to narrow our gender pay gap and will do this by achieving better representation of women in all roles at all levels of our organisation, especially in leadership positions,"" an M&G spokesperson said by email. Legal & General's mean gender pay gap widened to 30.8% from 27.6%. ""Legal & General is tackling the underlying causes of its pay gap by creating a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive culture through sustained, long-term action,"" the insurer said in its latest gender pay report.

wealth,The night before: 5 ways to navigate the pending holiday gift crunch," NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - If your kids have their hearts set on a particular toy this holiday season, a word of warning: It might not be easy as wandering into a store and plucking it off a shelf. Instead, you could find yourself smack in the middle of supply chain hell. In many ways, 2021 is a perfect logistical storm, says Juli Lennett, U.S. toy industry advisor at The NPD Group. ?�This has to do with shutdowns in China due to COVID, the cost of shipping increasing incredibly, the port of L.A. backing up, and the lack of trucks and drivers,??Lennett explains. On top of everything, there is also sky-high consumer demand. Last year?�s toy sales through August were up 18%. This year?�s sales are up another 18%, and that momentum is expected to continue barreling through the end of the year, Lennett says. ?�There has been an incredible increase in consumer demand,??says Ed Desmond, executive vice president for the trade group The Toy Association. ?�People have been in their homes for a year and half, and that has affected all kinds of consumer products ??including toys.??Supply-chain challenges around the world do not mean that you are out of options. But the situation does require that you be more strategic and thoughtful about holiday planning than in years past. Here are five tips from the experts: STOCK UP NOW It might seem silly to start buying now for an event months away, but that exactly what you should be doing. ?�So many people tend to wait until the holiday season, but there is actually good supply right now on the shelves,??Desmond says. ?�If you?�re in stores for other reasons like back-to-school shopping, and you see something you like, pick it up now.??CONSIDER TOY POPULARITY Every year, there are a handful of toys that catch fire in children's imaginations. If what you are looking for falls into that category, be proactive. For instance, nine of the top 10 fastest-selling new toys are either trading cards (football and baseball), or building sets, according to The NPD Group. In other words, if your kid wants a Lego set for Boba Fett?�s ship from the Star Wars character universe -- #6 on NPD?�s list ??start shopping. Other hot toy lists that could tip you off about impending product squeezes: USE MULTIPLE MONEY-SAVING STRATEGIES An in-demand product means it will be challenging this year to find attractive discounts ??but not necessarily impossible. Consumer finance expert Andrea Woroch suggests sites which monitor price drops, like Also be on the lookout for retailer coupons, such as through the browser extension Cently, which will automatically search for applicable coupons and apply those codes at checkout. You might find additional discounts for first-time purchases at a retailer, or for subscribing to their e-mail list. You could also get savings after the fact; some retailers will refund the difference if there is a subsequent price drop shortly after your purchase. EXPAND YOUR SEARCH Most consumers have a ""go-to"" site for many purchases, like Amazon, and don?�t search much beyond that. In 2021, you might have to deepen your pool of retailers: just because something is unavailable at one, doesn?�t mean it is out-of-stock at another. Google Shopping, Woroch suggests, is a useful tool for surveying a wide array of retailers for the same item. Another tip from Woroch: If an item is extremely popular and happens to be available locally, select the ""curbside pickup"" option. An online order could always get canceled by retailers if they run out, so take advantage and go pick it up yourself. WIDEN YOUR LIST If you are fixated on one desired item, you have essentially boxed yourself into a corner. Whereas if you have multiple possibilities, you have increased your chances of getting at least something on the list. It might be a good time manage expectations, and encourage kids to ask Santa for a few different gifts that they would be equally happy with. ?�If they want something very specific, you might have to divert them in a different direction,??says Lennett. ?�Or you could get not that precise product, but something close.""

wealth,Wells Fargo must face shareholder fraud claims over its recovery from scandals," NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected Wells Fargo & Co's The fourth-largest U.S. bank has operated since 2018 under consent orders from the Federal Reserve and two other U.S. financial regulators to improve governance and oversight, with the Fed also capping Wells Fargo's assets. Shareholders said bank officials falsely claimed in TV interviews, analyst calls and congressional testimony that the bank was mending its ways, when regulators actually viewed its progress as ""deficient"" and ""unacceptable."" U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan said the shareholders plausibly alleged that some statements by various bank officials, including former Chief Executive Tim Sloan, were ""deliberately or recklessly false or misleading."" According to shareholders, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo lost more than $54 billion of market value as the truth was gradually revealed over a two-year period ending in March 2020. Woods also dismissed claims against current Chief Executive Charles Scharf, saying he was not culpable for the challenged claims. The scandals prompted Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ""We will continue to vigorously defend the litigation and strongly disagree with the claims,"" Wells Fargo said in an email. Sloan's lawyer Josh Cohen said in an email on Friday that his client's statements were truthful, and that Sloan ""worked tirelessly to bring Wells Fargo into compliance with consent orders and regulatory demands."" The decision is a setback for Wells Fargo's rebound from revelations including that it opened about 3.5 million accounts without customer permission, and charged hundreds of thousands of borrowers for auto insurance they did not need. Wells Fargo has paid more than $5 billion in fines, and the Fed's $1.95 trillion asset cap restricts the bank's growth. Sloan stepped down abruptly as chief executive after 2-1/2 years in March 2019. One year later, Wells Fargo canceled a $15 million bonus for him. In his 61-page decision, Woods did not decide whether bank officials intended to defraud shareholders. But he said it would have been ""nearly impossible"" for Sloan to be unaware of the regulators' criticisms. ""Based on the facts on the ground, Mr. Sloan knew or, more importantly, should have known that he was misrepresenting material facts related to the corporation,"" Woods wrote. The shareholders are led by the state of Rhode Island, and pension funds in Louisiana, Mississippi and Sweden.

wealth,What to watch for in the U.S. SEC's GameStop report," NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to soon release its long-awaited report on the GameStop trading saga and it could have implications for brokerages, wholesale market makers, exchanges, and retail investors. The SEC report is expected to address the issues around the market chaos in late January when a flood of trading through commission-free retail brokerages drove shares in GameStop Corp Amid the intense volatility, several brokerages restricted trading in the affected stocks, curbing the rally, infuriating retail traders and rattling market confidence. Here are some topics the SEC has said it is scrutinizing: THE GAMIFICATION OF TRADING SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said the ""gamification of trading"" by commission-free retail brokerages is a growing concern because it could encourage more trading than is in investors' best interests. Gensler highlighted retail brokerages' use of artificial intelligence, predictive data analytics, and machine learning to push customized products to their customers and boost revenues. In March, brokerage Robinhood Markets PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW Gensler has been critical of payment for order flow (PFOF), the practice of retail brokers, like Robinhood or Charles Schwab Corp Gensler has said PFOF raises potential conflicts PFOF proponents say it is a major reason most brokerages were able to stop charging trading commissions, which helped fuel retail trading boom. The majority of Robinhood's revenue comes from PFOF. PFOF defenders say it benefits retail traders because wholesale brokers execute their trades at the best prices found on exchanges or better. But Gensler has said that because so many trades are now executed away from exchanges, where stock prices are formed, the best prices shown on exchanges may not accurately reflect market sentiment, causing wider bid-ask spreads to the detriment of all investors. MARKET MAKER CONCENTRATION The GameStop saga highlighted the small number of market-makers that dominate the retail market, with Citadel Securities executing around EXCHANGE PRICING Nearly half of all trades are executed away from exchanges. That is partly due to rules that allow market makers to offer fractional sub-penny price improvement on bids and offers, whereas exchanges have to quote in pennies, which Gensler has said has created an unleveled playing field. The ""sub-penny rule"" that limits exchanges to penny quotes was enacted in 2005 over concerns that if smaller pricing increments were allowed, sophisticated traders might use them to jump ahead of retail orders. CLEARINGHOUSES AND SETTLEMENT TIMES January's massive volatility in ""meme"" stocks prompted the post-trade clearinghouse that guarantees trades to demand billions of dollars in extra collateral from retail trading platforms. In response, several brokers restricted trading in the affected stocks, sparking speculation on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum that the brokers were protecting hedge funds that stood to lose out if the shares rose. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has argued the problem was largely due the two-day time period it takes to settle a trade, and if settlements were in real time, collateral would not have been an issue. Gensler has indicated SHORT SELLING DISCLOSURES Most of the stocks in the GameStop saga were heavily shorted - a strategy used to bet a stock price will fall - with more than 140% short interest in GameStop, implying that more shares were shorted than available to trade. That is possible on paper because when shares are borrowed to short and then sold back into the market, the new owner of the shares has no idea they are on the other side of a short sale, and can lend them out, just as the previous owner did. Gensler has said he considering greater disclosure around short selling and securities lending.

wealth,Analysis: Growth funds among Q3 winners for U.S. investors as COVID worries grew," NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - U.S. mid-cap growth funds, emerging market stocks and inflation-protected bonds were among the winners for U.S. investors in a turbulent third quarter that saw the benchmark S&P 500 hit a record high only to tumble at the end of September as rising Treasury yields and debt negotiations in Washington weighed on investor sentiment. Growth funds investing in U.S. equities beat their value-focused peers in the quarter, as a COVID-19 resurgence over the summer bolstered the case for investors to shift back into some of the big technology names that led markets during last year?�s coronavirus lockdowns, reviving the so-called stay-at-home trade. That move has reversed in recent weeks as Treasury yields shot higher. The average large-cap U.S. growth fund gained 4.6%, while the average large-cap value fund gained 0.9%, according to Morningstar. The S&P 500 is on track for a 1.4% gain, after rising by nearly 8.2% in the second quarter. ""The general melt-up in risky assets continued and we think a lot of that is being driven by accommodative monetary policy,"" said Marc Zabicki, director of research for LPL Financial. Investors are now gauging to what degree the concerns that erupted in recent weeks will impact U.S. stock performance for the rest of the year. Those include a hawkish tilt from the Federal Reserve that has boosted Treasury yields, the meltdown of heavily indebted Chinese property developer China Evergrande Group ""The global economy is suffering from a series of significant economic shocks at a time when some segments of the market are quite expensive based on lofty expectations of long-term growth,"" wrote Sebastien Galy, senior market strategist at Nordea Asset Management. The $37 million Alger Mid-Cap 40 ETF was the best performer among funds that invest in U.S. equities, with a 17.4% gain, according to Morningstar. The fund's largest holdings include cloud-based company HubSpot Inc Among the quarter's top performers were several funds that invest in Indian equities, a reflection of the surging Sensex stock market index The gains from the red-hot Indian market pushed the $617 million Wasatch Emerging India fund ahead of all other actively managed U.S.-based funds, with a 21.9% return for the quarter through Sept. 24, according to the most recent data available from Morningstar. The fund's largest position, accounting for nearly 10% of its assets, is in financial services firm Bajaj Finance Ltd Among bond funds, six of the 25 top-performing funds invested primarily in inflation-protected bonds, nearly double that of any other category, according to Morningstar, amid worries that the current surge in consumer prices may last longer than expected. The $4.2 billion AlphaCentric Income Opportunities fund, a multi-sector fund that has approximately half its portfolio in below-investment-grade bonds, turned in the best performance among bond funds overall, with a 4% return for the quarter. One key factor that will likely drive the performance of both stocks and bonds for the remainder of the year will be the outcome of debt ceiling negotiations in Washington over the next few weeks, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Congress has yet to pass a funding bill to keep the government open. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the U.S. government will hit its debt limit on Oct. 18, opening the possibility of a default.

Warnings have been rung from policymakers to Wall Street bankers of the risk that talks go down to the wire. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co ""There's a very packed legislative calendar over the next few weeks and there are significant tail risks in the short term,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management. ""Our view is that ultimately cooler heads will prevail."" Some signs of nervousness are showing in U.S. markets as the U.S. Congress faces a pair of approaching deadlines to fund the government and address the nation's $28.4 trillion debt ceiling.  It has a Sept. 30 deadline to avert the start of a shutdown of government services. Secretary Janet Yellen has urged Congress to act before Oct. 18 to avert ""serious harm"" to the economy. ""If the government shuts down that's not a big deal, but if they continue to play games with the debt ceiling that can cause big problems"" and lead to a significant selloff throughout financial markets, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. The mounting possibilities that Congress could fail to act in time to prevent a shutdown or debt default were cited by some as contributing to equity weakness in recent days. In currency markets, some analysts believe worries over the debt ceiling have helped boost the U.S. dollar . The situation remains at an impasse. Democrats in Congress on Wednesday said they would vote to head off an imminent government shutdown before funding expires at midnight on Thursday. The House and Senate may vote on a separate bill that temporarily lifts the debt limit, but Senate Republicans refuse to vote for it. Still, since the United States has been down to the wire on this before, investors have voiced a nonchalant view on the issue. ""It's hard to know if the market really cares about the debt ceiling,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. ""If you're kind of rational you probably don't, because somehow it gets resolved. On the other hand, it's a risk you can't ignore."" In one sign of a lack of urgency on Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher Wednesday. Wells Fargo analyst Michelle Wan wrote on Tuesday that investors have ""so far responded with a shrug"" to the looming deadline, with complacency ""rooted in past compromises that avoided defaults and other payment disruptions."" Debt ceiling-related nervousness has, however, been showing in the Treasury bills market. Michael Purves, CEO at Tallbacken Capital Advisors in New York, wrote in a note on Monday that tension was seen in the pricing of three-month bills which ""presumably won't be burdened by default risk"" compared with one-month bills. Still, that has yet to reflect the more dramatic spikes in 2011, 2013 and 2015, Purves said. One-month bills  currently yield 0.07%, higher than three-month bills  which yield 0.04%. At the beginning of the year, both yielded around 0.08%. Portfolio managers typically avoid bill issues at risk of default even if the likelihood of a failed payment is very low. This can send yields on some issues higher than those on longer-dated debt, an unusual occurrence in the yield curve, which is typically upward-sloping. Analysts at BMO said that ""as investors??attention remains trained on Washington the distortions"" in the front end of the yield curve ""are likely to persist until an accord is reached."" In another sign of concern, analysts at TD noted a sharp jump in thinly-traded U.S. credit default swaps . Past crises have shaken the market - but only temporarily. A technical default and subsequent downgrade of U.S. debt in 2011 helped push the S&P 500 almost 20% from its high before it rebounded. Another prolonged debt-ceiling negotiation in 2013 pushed the S&P 500 down 5.8%, but there was little market reaction to similar deadlines in 2016 or 2018 as Wall Street began to see the threat of crisis as manufactured, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Sensitive markets such as money markets have not shown rising levels of panic, according to Peter Crane, head of Crane Data, which focuses on the money market industry. ""They might pull up to the last minute but everybody knows both sides are bluffing,"" said Crane.

wealth,Wells Fargo to pay $37.3 mln to settle U.S. claims it fraudulently overcharged customers," NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Monday's settlement resolves U.S. Department of Justice civil fraud charges against the fourth-largest U.S. bank, and includes a $35.3 million fine plus a $2 million forfeiture. Wells Fargo previously returned $35.3 million to customers as restitution, making its total payout about $72.7 million. The Justice Department said sales specialists jokingly used expressions such as ""back the truck up"" and ""when in doubt, spread them out"" when they were overcharging customers, with one referring to the sales group as a ""bucket shop."" Wells Fargo declined to comment, pending required approval of the settlement by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan federal court. The San Francisco-based bank has been subject since 2018 to a Federal Reserve cap on assets, which must remain below $1.95 trillion until it improves its governance and risk controls. Wells Fargo has already paid more than $5 billion in fines since the scandals began in 2016. On Sept. 22, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was closely monitoring the bank's efforts to address ""widespread and pervasive"" problems. Powell spoke eight days after Massachusetts U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for Wells Fargo to be broken up. Shares of Wells Fargo closed down 36 cents, or 0.8%, at $47.56. Monday's settlement resolves claims that Wells Fargo defrauded 771 commercial customers, including many small- and mid-sized businesses, on foreign exchange services between 2010 and 2017. The government said Wells Fargo systematically charged higher spreads and sales margins than it promised, and encouraged the overcharges by linking specialists' bonuses to how much revenue they generated. According to court papers, specialists also used what they called the ""big figure trick"" or ""transposition error game"" to cheat customers, such as by charging $1.0213 to buy euros instead of $1.0123, picking up an extra 89 basis points. A whistleblower, former Wells Fargo foreign exchange trader Paul Kohn, will receive $1.6 million from the bank's payout, the maximum available. His lawyer, Jonathan Willens, said Kohn had worked on a different desk from where the alleged fraud occurred, but was in the same room and could hear what transpired. Our Standards:"
wealth,"As Americans spend, credit card debt is ticking back up"," NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Early in the pandemic, there were encouraging and surprising signs about the decline of credit card debt. Now, that trendline seems to be changing. Many Americans stayed at home at the start of COVID-19 and did not spend like they usually do. They also received several rounds of emergency cash assistance, helping to chop away at those credit-card bills, at least temporarily. Spending is ticking back up ??and the results are starting to show up on our monthly statements. In fact, 42% of those with credit card debt, or 59 million Americans, say they have added to their balances since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a new study by personal finance site Bankrate.com. ""Things are better for some, but they are not better for everybody,"" explains Ted Rossman, Bankrate?�s senior industry analyst. The end of stimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits and the eviction moratorium does not bode well for debt management, Rossman added. This trend reversal is reflected in the most recent numbers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Its Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit found that credit-card bills rose by $17 billion in 2021?�s second quarter, to $790 billion nationally. That was the first uptick after four straight quarters of declines. Also headed north were auto loans, by $33 billion in the quarter, and mortgage debt, by $282 billion. All told it makes for total household debt of $14.96 trillion, a quarterly rise of 2.1%. DIFFERENT DEBT, DIFFERENT STRATEGIES Of course, not all debt is the same, nor should it automatically be considered a bad thing. The rise in mortgage debt can be attributed to many people buying homes in a hot real estate market ??and with interest rates near historic lows, that is not necessarily a concern for household balance sheets. Credit card debt is especially pernicious, though. It can be very challenging to escape as balances rise to a certain level, combined with sky-high interest on revolving debt ??average rates are currently north of 16%, according to Bankrate. Add in late fees or missed payments, and the cycle is hard to break. Those concerns are highlighted in a recent survey by real estate firm Clever. Almost one in five of those with credit card debt, 18%, report having bills over $20,000. Meanwhile 40% of those who carry a monthly balance haven?�t been debt-free from credit cards since before 2018, and 15% have been struggling with it for more than 15 years. ""We also found that 57% of people had missed a credit-card payment, and the majority of those were in the past year,"" says Francesca Ortegren, lead researcher for Clever. ""It could cause a snowball effect over time, and make it much harder to climb out."" Chronic debt can make people feel pretty bleak. A third of those with credit card debt think it will take at least a couple of years to pay it off, and 20% say three years or more, according to Clever. Most depressing of all, 3% think it will never be possible. CHARTING A WAY OUT To be sure, there are glimmers of good news in the debt data. Even though credit card bills are once again headed back up, the early-pandemic declines means that total amounts are still $140 billion below the end of 2019's levels, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And student loan debt actually dropped in the second quarter of 2021, by $14 billion. Meanwhile personal savings rates are still elevated, compared to historic norms. And debt delinquencies and defaults are relatively modest, notes Bankrate?�s Rossman -- which is somewhat surprising, given the length and breadth of our ongoing pandemic crisis. What Rossman worries about: That our early-pandemic frugality will fall by the wayside, and the urge to get out and spend after being cooped up for so long will throw whatever progress we have made into reverse. Instead, Americans should be proactive. He suggests: Take advantage of the growing number of 0% card balance-transfer offers, partner with nonprofit credit counselors like Money Management International or GreenPath, or pay off high-rate cards with a lower-rate personal loan. ""It would be nice if we could keep lower balances as a part of our future,"" Rossman says. ""You don?�t want to throw that all away and run those balances right back up ??because this is very expensive debt.""

None of the other asset managers provided comment. Evergrande owes $305 billion and has run short of cash. Some investors worry a corporate collapse could pose systemic risks to China's financial system and reverberate around the world. Last week, Evergrande failed to pay interest on a $2 billion dollar bond maturing in March. It will default if it makes no payment within a 30-day grace period. HSBC Holdings PLC's Credit Suisse Group AG Fellow Swiss bank UBS has Evergrande debt exposure totalling about $283 million across multiple portfolios, Morningstar said. Ashmore's runs to $146 million. Both declined to comment. Morningstar had earlier noted BlackRock's exposure had recently increased. In its Friday analysis, it said BlueBay had ""gradually started adding"". ""The investment team proactively reduced exposure to the company earlier this year,"" BlueBay said in a statement. Morningstar did not give a dollar total for BlueBay exposure, though the researcher listed two BlueBay funds in its top exposure lists with exposure of about $8 million in July, along with an index-tracking fund managed by BlackRock  which it said had about $1.5 million in exposure in September.

wealth,U.S. SEC delays certain assets from enforcement actions under new disclosure rule," WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday that it would delay enforcement of certain assets from a new disclosure rule for off-exchange securities until Jan. 3, 2022. The new compliance date was due to come into effect on Tuesday. The agency's no action letter, which affects quotes published by broker dealers for buying and selling of government bonds, does not change or amend the compliance date for a new rule aimed at stamping out fraud in U.S. equities markets starting on Sept. 28, 2021, the agency said. The position ""concerns enforcement action only and does not represent a legal conclusion with respect to the applicability of statutory or regulatory provisions of the securities laws,"" the agency said. Next week's new measure The requirements have sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. The Financial Times reported this week that the new regulation may stave off broker dealers from trading in this space and taking on risks for fear of attracting an SEC enforcement action. Bond trade associations, including the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, wrote to regulators to say amended rules will have a ?�significant, deleterious effect??on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply, the FT reported. The SEC's Friday letter is a response to such cries by industry. While compliance is still mandatory by the Tuesday deadline, the top markets watchdog said its delay of enforcement actions is meant to allow for the necessary industry ""operational and systems changes"" that may lead to compliance with the rule.

The standard is also gaining more usage in non-U.S. indexes, the foundation said. Use of a different ESG effort, the Global Reporting Initiative, has also grown, with at least 10,000 users worldwide, a spokesman for the initiative said. The SEC this year requested public comments on how it might direct companies to report similar material on their climate impact and other areas. In a ""sample letter"" on its website, the SEC described the sort of questions it asks of companies currently. These could include questions about litigation risks related to climate change, or requests for companies to explain why statements made in voluntary corporate social responsibility reports are different from those made in SEC filings.

Wood, who has said that bitcoin will rally to $500,000, has slightly more than $1 billion invested in cryptocurrency trading firm Coinbase Global Inc China's move triggered a selloff in bitcoin, taking the value of the world's largest cryptocurrency down more than 5% to approximately $42,475.

wealth,Investors look ahead to rate hikes with Fed tapering plan all but certain," NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Investors are grappling with how an unwind of the Federal Reserve?�s easy money policies could affect asset prices, after the central bank signaled that a taper of its bond-buying program was closer than ever and suggested it may raise rates at a faster-than-expected pace. In what some described as a hawkish tilt, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank The focus on rate increases comes as investors gauge how markets will respond to an unwind of the central bank?�s $120 billion per month bond-buying program, which has helped the S&P 500 double from its March 2020 lows. Though many had expected the central bank to begin its unwind before the year was up, some investors said the projection for rate increases may spur worries over whether the Fed risks tightening monetary policy at a time when the economy could be significantly weaker than it is today, potentially undercutting the case for stocks and other comparatively risky assets. ""With this hawkish move, the Fed risks tightening policy into a slow-growth backdrop,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. Stocks held onto their gains after the Fed?�s statement, with the S&P 500 closing up nearly 1%. In Treasury markets, the gap between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell below 100 basis points after the Fed policy statement to the lowest level since July 2020. A narrower gap could indicate factors like economic uncertainty, easing inflation concerns and anticipation of tighter monetary policy. ?�The rates market interpreted Fed communications as hawkish,??analysts at BoFA Global Research said in a note. ?�The more hawkish Fed is a key ingredient for our higher rates view into year-end.??The Fed funds market fully priced in a rate hike by January 2023 after the statement, moving projected rate increases forward by a month. Analysts at TD Securities expect the central bank to reduce its asset purchases by $15 billion a month starting in November, helping push up yields and strengthen the dollar, they said in a report. The U.S. currency's trajectory is important for investors as it impacts everything from commodity prices to corporate earnings. Higher yields make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to income-seeking investors. The greenback was up 0.23% against a basket of its peers late Wednesday. ""Once the dust settles it seems that there are enough hawkish signals to keep the dollar biased higher, as the market pencils in a sooner-than-expected rate hike,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. Others were sanguine on the Fed?�s outlook, saying the more hawkish view was a reflection of the economy?�s strength in the face of a COVID-19 resurgence. Markets are likely to remain more focused on the inference that additional rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 would suggest a strengthening economy than on the Fed's tapering plan, said Mark Freeman, chief investment officer at Socorro Asset Management. ""Powell clarified repeatedly ... that the criteria for tapering is very different than criteria for raising rates, which is much higher"" and will have more of a market impact, he said. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said in a note that robust demand for Treasuries would likely minimize the impact of the Fed?�s unwind. ?�With the demand for income and financial assets that we?�re seeing..., the modest tapering likely to be seen from the Fed is not consequential for markets,??he said.

wealth,U.S. 'pink sheets' in shakeup as securities regulator looks to stamp out fraud," WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - As many as 2,000 companies could disappear from the off-exchange ""pink sheets,"" long a favorite of retail investors, when a new rule aimed at stamping out fraud in this notoriously risky enclave of U.S. equities markets comes into effect next week. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule boosts investor disclosures by requiring off-exchange issuers, frequently penny-stock companies that do not meet the main exchanges' listing standards, to make accurate, up-to-date financial information publicly available. Due to a loophole in the current rules, around 2,000 of the roughly 11,000 companies quoted on the Pink Market operated by New York-based OTC Markets Group OTC Markets has been trying to spread the word and encourage companies to get their paperwork in order, but it was still unclear how many would do so in time for the Sept. 28 deadline, if at all, said Daniel Zinn, the company's general counsel. The market operator may have to remove, if only temporarily, between 1,000 and 2,000 stocks from the Pink Market, he estimated, meaning broker quotes will no longer be available to investors via online retail broker platforms. The shakeup, which comes amid a boom in retail trading, has led some brokers including Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade While customers will be still able to sell their shares after Sept. 28, brokers have warned of severely limited liquidity, which usually means investors get a bad deal. Investors still keen to dabble in companies that have not complied may have to call up their broker for a quote. The rule will also apply to some government and corporate bond issuers, leading industry lobby groups to warn this week of potential disruption to that critical funding market. Overall, the new rule is likely to increase the cost of trading these companies, said Zinn. ""We're in agreement with the SEC's goals of providing as much disclosure as possible,"" said Zinn. Some companies, however, prefer not to provide public financial data for a number of legitimate reasons, or may be unable to, he continued. For example, some companies may not want to incur the legal cost of providing compliant paperwork, while others may not want to promote trading in their stock. ""In those circumstances, no quotes at all may lead to more harm than help for existing investors,"" said Zinn. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment. The Pink Market is home to an array of issuers, including reputable foreign companies seeking a gateway to the United States. But some are highly risky and volatile penny-stock companies in distress, delinquency or which are simply shells. The SEC has warned that the off-exchange market, more broadly, is rife with fraud and manipulation. Under the SEC's previous rules, broker-dealers had to review a company's financials before providing quotes in its stock on the Pink Market, unless another broker-dealer had already vetted them. That was the case even if the initial review happened years ago and the company had since stopped publishing financial information. The new SEC rule ends that exemption. ""Companies are on notice to provide a certain level of transparency for their investors or they can't be easily quoted. That's a good thing,"" said Georgetown University professor Jim Angel. ""The problem is what about the companies that choose not to disclose? Their shareholders are being punished for the actions of the companies."" 'SHOW ME THE MONEY' A new wave of amateur investors has piled in to penny stocks over the past 18 months, trading on low or no-fee retail broker platforms and hyping up their positions on social media.

The conclusion, from a new study, indicates that credit card lenders might not have lost as much business as suspected during the pandemic to the rise of ""buy now, pay later"" plans. ""These new forms of financing are growing the credit pie, opening up more opportunities for both consumers and lenders,"" said Liz Pagel, senior vice president of consumer lending at TransUnion The study looked at credit profiles of more than 4.5 million people who applied for point-of-sale financing from October 2019 through March. TransUnion found that a smaller portion of people who applied had reduced their card debt, 54%, compared with 60% of the general population. Some 20% increased their card debt by more than half. Though financial technology companies have The study did not determine how much additional card lending banks lost to ""buy now, pay later."" In a separate TransUnion survey in August, one-third of people who had used a ""buy now, pay later"" plan said they would have used a credit card had the plan not been available. Those applying do not appear to be increasing the risk of losses on existing loans, TransUnion said. Delinquency rates on their credit cards six months after their applications were only slightly worse than the general population at 3.2% versus 2.7%.

wealth,Fed's Powell says Wells Fargo asset cap to stay in place until problems fixed," Sept 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the Fed is closely monitoring efforts by Wells Fargo & Co In 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls following sales practice scandals. That constrains Wells Fargo's ability to make new loans.

Ackman, who runs hedge fund firm Pershing Square Capital Management, told investors that his Pershing Square Holdings portfolio returned 15.3% after fees since January. The fund was up 7.7% a week ago. The gains were largely fueled by his investment in Universal Music Group (UMG), the label that is home to Taylor Swift, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.

wealth,Analysis: Investors grappling with Evergrande fallout weigh risk of wider pain," NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Investors unnerved by the fallout from heavily indebted Chinese real estate company Evergrande For now, many U.S.-based investors believe there is little chance that the woes of Evergande, China?�s second-largest property developer, could morph into a systemic crisis reminiscent of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. Still, with valuations on U.S. equities stretched on a historical basis and an unwind of the Federal Reserve?�s easy money policies looming, some worry that a sudden drop in risk appetite could leave global markets vulnerable to a broader selloff. ""We have a very cautious view on the market given elevated valuation levels,"" said Rob Romero, portfolio manager at Connective Capital, a technology hedge fund with $100 million in assets under management. ""It is hard to know how far the contagion will spread. We are looking for signs of resilience in U.S. market; if that doesn?�t happen, that means contagion has more risk to snowball."" The concerns over the extent of Evergrande's reverberations through the global financial system come at a time when high valuations in the equities markets had many investors and analysts calling for a pullback. The benchmark S&P 500 traded at 21.6 times forward earnings as of Friday, near its highest levels since the late 1990s dotcom bubble, and prior to Monday's trading had rallied more than 18% for the year to date. CONCERNS BREWING While Evergrande's woes have been playing out for several months, its shares tumbled more than 10% on Monday as Chinese regulators warned that its $305 billion in liabilities could lead to widespread losses in China's financial system if its debts are not stabilized.

wealth,Japan's MUFG to exit U.S. retail banking in $8 bln deal with U.S. Bancorp," TOKYO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) The deal includes $5.5 billion in cash and $2.5 billion worth of shares that will give Japan's biggest lender a 2.9% stake in Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the fifth largest bank in the United States, the banks said on Tuesday. Following the deal, which it expects to close by the end of June next year, MUFG will focus on corporate and investment banking in the United States through other units and through its partnership with Morgan Stanley ""We can't succeed without a certain scale of business,"" Morito Emi, a managing director for corporate planning at the Japanese bank, said at a press briefing. ""There's a lot of mergers and acquisitions going on there,"" he added. In order to compete, MUB, which has around 300 branches mostly on the West Coast of the United States, would have had to invest heavily in new digital technology to keep pace with bigger rivals offering new online banking services, Emi said. The pandemic has further emphasized longstanding trends facing U.S. banks. Historically low interest rates have made earning profits tough, and lockdown measures to contain the virus have made consumers more comfortable utilizing digital channels, forcing greater spending on technology. Consolidation has been one way to address these challenges, with deals reaching $55 billion in value last year, the highest in more than a decade. Much activity has been focused on the mid-sized and larger regional lenders, who are trying to keep up with the big four national banks.

The acquisition is being made at 1.3-times MUB's tangible book value, a common indicator used to judge bank mergers, while U.S. Bancorp said it will extract $900 million of cost savings from integrating systems and combining real estate footprints. The exit from MUB is the latest departure from U.S. retail banking by non-American lenders, which have struggled to compete against domestic rivals. Spain's BBVA MUFG's push into U.S. banking had been part of a strategy to expand business overseas to boost profits because ultra-low interest rates and a shrinking population in Japan have made it difficult to earn at home. The deal with U.S. Bancorp comes as MUFG shifts its focus more to other parts of Asia. Mitsubishi UFJ in 2008 paid around $3.5 billion for the third of Mitsubishi Union Bank it did not already control. With assets of $132 billion, it provides corporate, commercial and retail banking as well as wealth management. In addition to the $8 billion of cash and stock from U.S. Bancorp, the Japanese parent will also get around $9.6 billion from dividends or share repurchases at MUB, bringing the total value of the transaction to $17.6 billion. Part of MUB's administrative functions and its corporate and investment banking departments will be transferred to other parts of MUFG's U.S. operations.

wealth,U.S. SEC warns investors of risks from certain Chinese business entities," WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday issued its latest warning to people looking to invest in Chinese companies listed in the United States. In an alert to investors, the SEC detailed the potential risks in putting money into U.S.-listed companies that have contracts with but no control over a Chinese entity, known as a variable interest entity (VIE). It is the most recent move by the agency to address concerns that Chinese companies are flouting rules for accessing U.S. markets. In July, the agency According to the SEC, these U.S.-listed companies often own a subsidiary in China that was formed to enter into the contractual arrangements with the China-based VIE. The contracts can include powers of attorney, equity pledge agreements, and exclusive services or business cooperation agreements. The VIE structure is typically used because of Beijing's restrictions on non-Chinese ownership of companies in key industries in China, the SEC said. In selling shares to U.S. investors, the firms are raising capital from U.S. investors without distributing ownership of those firms to them. The SEC warned investors that they are exposed to risk if Beijing determines they violate Chinese law, may be subject to Chinese jurisdiction in enforcing any contracts and may be affected by conflicts of interest between the owners of the entity and U.S. shareholders.

wealth,"Column: Social Security doomsayers are wrong again, but reform choices loom"," Sept 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. government recently released its annual report on the health of Social Security. Not surprisingly, that was met with a slew of doomsday forecasts from pundits and media. Social Security will soon be insolvent! Insolvency is coming years earlier than we thought! Benefit cuts are a real possibility! These panicky predictions appear every year when the trustees overseeing Social Security issue their report on the financial health of the program, and this year was no exception. The pandemic-induced recession of 2020 added a new twist, since many forecasters were predicting before the report was released that COVID-19 would dramatically worsen the financial outlook for Social Security. Guess what: it didn?�t happen. But the U.S. Congress does need to address a long-range imbalance in Social Security finances - and lawmakers should expand benefits in a targeted way while they are at it. Last year, the dramatic fall in employment and earnings in the second quarter of 2020 did translate into lower Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) revenue paid into the system by workers and employers - temporarily. And the pandemic did worsen the financial health of Social Security, but just a bit. The trustees project that the reserves of the combined Social Security retirement and disability trust funds will be depleted in 2034 - one year earlier than predicted a year ago. ?�We were all expecting substantially lower earnings and employment throughout the year,??said Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, during a webinar discussion of the trustee report convened last week by the National Academy of Social Insurance. ?�In fact, the earnings and employment came back more rapidly than we and others had anticipated.??The causes of the long-range imbalance in Social Security have long been clear: rising benefit outlays expenses as the nation ages, and a dramatic decline in birth rates, which translates into fewer workers paying into the system over time. Congress has known about these problems since the early 1990s. But the situation has been a stalemate because there has been no consensus about how to address the problem, especially with the rising political polarization of the last decade. Conservatives have pushed for a higher full-retirement age - which effectively cuts benefits by raising the bar for attaining your full benefit - while progressives developed a consensus over the past decade around new revenue and expansion. Make no mistake, depletion of the trust funds in 2034 is an outcome to be avoided. At that point, absent action by Congress, a draconian, across-the-board benefit cut would be imposed on everyone - current and future retirees alike - of roughly 20%. But solutions are available. ?�Congress will need to make choices,??said Goss. ?�We can either increase our revenue by about one-third, or reduce the scheduled benefits by that much, or do some combination of the two. But enacting the changes sooner than later allows more possibilities for the Congress to consider a more gradual phasing-in of changes, and more advanced notice to everyone who will be affected.??KICK THE CAN OR TAKE ACTION A higher full-retirement age, phased in over time, would be the most likely benefit cut. The argument here: we are all living longer, so waiting a bit longer for Social Security should be no problem. But in reality not everyone is living longer - the recent gains in longevity are not spread evenly across the population. Longevity has been stagnant or shrinking for people of color and lower-income Americans, and that makes higher retirement ages profoundly inequitable. Lawmakers might just kick the can down the road until 2034 draws nearer - and if that happens, the odds are good there will be no benefit cuts at all. It is unlikely that Congress would impose benefit cuts at that point retroactively to current beneficiaries, and that means that significant cuts could be applied only to future beneficiaries. In that scenario, it would be difficult to avoid insolvency by relying on benefit cuts. New revenue would be the only possible path - either from tax increases or general government revenue. If we take action sooner, averting trust-fund exhaustion is the place to start, but Congress also should use targeted benefit expansion as a way to address the rising income inequality, racial and gender gaps that plague retirement security. The aim should be to boost the amount of preretirement income that Social Security replaces, especially for lower- and middle-income households that rely on the program most. Many expansion plans have been proposed over the past decade; the list includes benefit credits for people who take time off from paid work to provide caregiving to children or disabled adults, a more generous cost-of-living adjustment and higher benefit levels for widows. And we should reduce the reductions for claiming before full-retirement age. These reductions have become inequitable from an actuarial standpoint since they were enacted way back in the 1950s. We can pay for these changes with modest increases in FICA rates, or through other means. For example, we could permit the trust funds to invest a small portion of their holdings in equities, or impose a tax on financial market transactions. Reforming the program sooner than later would allow for a more thoughtful debate and discussion about possible solutions. And perhaps - just perhaps - action would extinguish the demagoguery that has fueled so much worry among the public about Social Security?�s future.

Dalio, who founded the world's largest hedge fund,  Bridgewater Associates, told attendees at the SALT conference in New York on Wednesday, ""I have more crypto than gold."" Cohen, who runs Point72 Asset Management, said earlier this week at the conference that he hopes not to miss out on opportunities presented by the digital currencies. SkyBridge, the alternative investment firm whose founder, Anthony Scaramucci is hosting the SALT conference, has a 12% investment in bitcoin, the firm's co-chief investment officer, Ray Nolte, said at the event. Even as investment firms seek to create funds for cryptocurrencies that feel and look like stock and bond funds, they are known for being volatile and potentially risky. Bitcoin , for example, traded over $48,000 on Wednesday, after dipping below $30,000 in July. In April it topped $60,000. Dalio said cryptocurrencies represent diversification and noted that portfolios need to be spread across more asset classes. ""Diversification is a good thing,"" he said. Cohen meanwhile has been studying cryptocurrencies for himself and potentially his firm for some time and told investors in May that he would be ""remiss"" to ignore the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market. This week, Cohen announced he was investing in Radkl, a digital asset investment and proprietary trading firm, and he told the conference that his firm, Point72, is building crypto-trading capabilities. Cryptocurrencies were a major theme at the SALT conference, which was held in person in New York this year after last year's event in Las Vegas was cancelled due to the pandemic. The Cohen and Dalio appearances were among the event's best-attended sessions, with fund managers and investors eager to hear how billionaires viewed topics ranging from China relations to working remotely versus in the office. Dalio said China could be viewed as an existential threat to the United States, adding it is imperative to have more contact  there, not less, to gain a better understanding of how the government operates.

wealth,Shareholder support for U.S. climate measures hits nearly 50% -report," BOSTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Support for climate-related shareholder resolutions at U.S. companies rose significantly this year, according to a report released on Wednesday, as investors focused on economic threats posed by global warming. The paper, from Institutional Shareholder Services, the largest proxy adviser, found median support for the proposals was 48.9% during the proxy season ended June 30, up from 37.6%  in 2020 and 27.5% in 2019. The total number of resolutions filed rose to 84, also an increase from the prior two years, the report found. Popular themes for shareholder climate resolutions this year included aligning emissions with the goals of the Paris Agreement, company greenhouse gas emissions and disclosures, and resolutions aimed at company lobbying activities, ISS said. ?�The 2021 U.S. proxy voting season marked an escalation of shareholder engagement on climate-related issues and an expansion of investor voting approaches,"" said Georgina Marshall, global head of research at ISS, in a statement. The figures were in line with earlier data showing rising support for climate measures.

wealth,"Flagship Wall St conference sees record attendance, run on steak"," NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - A flagship Wall Street conference returned this week, attracting so many fund managers and investors who were hungry for in-person interactions that organizers ran out of a steak and  lobster entree and seats at its first lunch on Monday. The three-day SALT event, long one of the hedge fund industry's biggest conferences, took a break during the pandemic last year but its host, Anthony Scaramucci, was determined to bring it back this year with strict safety protocols, a different kind of agenda and much closer to home for many. The roughly 2,300 people who came in person needed to show proof of vaccination and the venue changed to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, from the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Initially, guests roamed the spacious hallways wearing masks, bumping elbows and leaving distance between seats in the cavernous conference rooms. But within a few hours early nervousness had melted away and there were handshakes and hugs aplenty between longtime business associates, many of whom had not seen each other in over 18 months. The lunch area was so crowded on the first two days that there was a mad race for seats and boxed lunches had to be served to those standing at the back of the room. ""In New York, people have more of a game face on,"" Scaramucci told Reuters in an interview. ""There isn't the kind of frivolity that we have in Vegas."" He joked that more people were sitting in the darkened conference rooms actually listening to presenters than in Las Vegas, where they might be playing slots. Many of the prominent investors who had appeared in the past were back, including Steven A. Cohen, Daniel Loeb, Marc Lasry, Mike Novogratz and Ray Dalio. Sports legends Joe Torre and Bobby Valentine also appeared, as did media personality Paris Hilton. But there was a heavier focus on cryptocurrency investments, which have soared in popularity, as well as how the pandemic has changed society in investable ways than the human interest elements that made the Vegas destination popular. There was plenty of talk about how funds survived enormous volatility during COVID-19, how they are handling back-to-work arrangements - hedge fund manager Cohen says he likes working from home and doesn't have to be in the office five days a week - and what may happen with inflation. ""It was great to see people again and to have so many conversations,"" said Milind Sharma, chief investment officer at QuantZ Capital. ""That alone was worth the price I paid to come."" In addition to the 2,300 people who showed up in person, 700 signed up to view the program remotely, making it the best attended conference ever, SALT organizers said. Many attendees who spoke to Reuters said they were given tickets for free rather than pay the entry fee, which totaled $8,000 a ticket for some. Scaramucci launched the SALT event in 2009 when he ran hedge fund investment firm SkyBridge Capital. He left in 2017 to become communications director for former President Donald Trump for just 11 days, eventually returning to SkyBridge. At the conference he joked that his firing might have been the best thing that happened to him, saving his career, his firm and his marriage. The pandemic, which has so far killed 4.8 million people globally, prevented Scaramucci from organizing SALT in its usual three-day in-person format last year. Although the Delta variant  sparked concerns about the New York event and even some talk of postponing it, it appears to have gone off without a hitch. As for SALT's future, Scaramucci wasn't ruling anything out, including a return to the Vegas strip. ""You have to come up the risk curve in order to get back to normal,"" he said.

wealth,Fading retail demand for U.S. stocks could hit S&P 500 - Vanda," Sept 15 (Reuters) - Retail investors' appetite for U.S. stocks has fallen in the past week, data from Vanda Research showed on Wednesday, increasing the odds for a broader sell-off in the S&P 500 at a time when it is already about 2% off its record high. In the five days to Tuesday, retail investors bought $657.7 million in U.S. equity exchange-traded funds, compared with $989.6 million and $1.39 billion in the preceding two weeks, partly due to a surge in demand for cryptocurrencies, analysts at Vanda wrote in a client note. ""Retail investors have bought every minor dip in equities this year, shielding the S&P against a double digit sell-off (but) this diminishing appetite to support the equity rally raises the odds of a larger sell-off if institutional investors continue to sell,"" said Ben Onatibia, senior strategist at Vanda.

wealth,Investors turn bearish on global economy though positioning upbeat - BofA survey," LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Barely a tenth of respondents in a monthly fund manager survey expect a stronger global economy in the coming months, marking the lowest proportion since last April's initial COVID-19 panic, Bank of America's (BofA's) September edition of the survey showed. Economic growth expectations are now at a net 13%, the lowest since April 2020 and markedly down from a 91% peak in March this year. The spread of the Delta variant was cited as the reason for the pessimism, the popular monthly survey said. Despite the growing caution on the macroeconomic outlook, positioning in asset markets remains overwhelmingly bullish. Equity market protection designed to shield portfolios against a sharp drop in asset values was at the lowest levels since January 2008. Nearly half of BofA's clients, with $840 billion in assets under management, said they have removed protection against a sharp fall in equity prices over the next three months, the lowest figure since January 2018. Moreover, broader equity market positioning remains firmly bullish with net global equity allocations at 50%, far above a 20-year average of 29%, the survey said. ""A rare disconnect is growing between asset prices and fundamentals,"" a team of strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients. The broader market outlook remains one of greater caution with survey respondents expecting central banks to remain dovish. Eighty four percent of investors now expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to start reeling in its stimulus measures by the end of the year, though expectations for the first U.S. rate hike were pushed out to February 2023 from November 2022 previously. Moreover, 82% of respondents expect China to ease policy, up from 44% in July. Global liquidity conditions were widely seen as the best since just before the global financial crisis hit world markets in July 2007. Almost 60% of respondents in the survey said monetary policy was ""too simulative"" which was the highest proportion since May 2011.

wealth,"U.S. SEC chair wants private fund fee disclosures, bond market transparency -testimony"," WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The chair of the top U.S. securities regulator wants private funds to disclose more information to investors about potential conflicts of interest and the fees they charge, according to congressional testimony published Monday evening. Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also wants to impose greater transparency on the corporate bond, municipal bond and asset-backed securities market, which combined are worth about $28 trillion, he wrote in the testimony submitted to the Senate Banking Committee. Gensler will appear before the congressional panel on Tuesday to field questions on his agenda for the regulator. ""I believe we can enhance disclosures in this area, better enabling pensions and others investing in these private funds to get the information they need to make investment decisions,"" Gensler wrote. In the bond markets, meanwhile, trading data is often insufficient, causing liquidity crunches during times of stress, which was evident during last year's market turmoil sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""This market is so critical to issuers. It is nearly 2.5 times larger than the commercial bank lending of about $10.5 trillion in our economy,"" Gensler wrote in his testimony, without elaborating on the changes he may pursue. Addressing fund fees and the bond market add to an already jam-packed agenda for the SEC, which is working on new corporate climate change-risk disclosures, cracking down on blank-check company deals, and overhauling several aspects of the U.S. equity market structure. Also on Monday, Gensler, writing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, urged Chinese companies to open up their books and records to SEC scrutiny or risk being kicked off U.S. exchanges.

wealth,Investors tense up as fears of post-election gridlock rise in Canada," TORONTO, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Foreign investors are growing more worried that Canada's federal election on Monday could result in a deadlock that hampers Ottawa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and further slows the economic recovery from the crisis. Polls show Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's center-left Liberals virtually tied with the opposition Conservatives ahead of the Sept. 20 vote, raising the prospect that no party will be able to form even a stable minority government. Adding to the uncertainty is an expected increase in mail-in voting that could delay the counting of ballots in some key electoral ridings. Financial markets generally view Canadian elections from the vantage point of which of the big parties would be most friendly for investors, but that tendency may take a backseat this time to the desire to have a government quickly in place in a crisis. The results of Canadian elections typically are known within hours of the polls closing. Even when no party has won a majority of the seats, it is usually clear which will form the government and what the general policy priorities will be. An outcome ""that leads to a gridlocked government is going to complicate the recovery going forward, and I think that's why you are probably going to see some (investor) hesitancy ahead of the election,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. ""Right now, we're in the process of an economic recovery that needs everything to line up nicely."" Trudeau, who has been prime minister for six years, has relied on the backing of the New Democrats since failing to win a majority of the seats in the House of Commons in the 2019 election. Polls show the smaller left-leaning party poised to do better on Monday, with enough support perhaps to compel the Liberals to tilt to the left if they wish to remain in power. SPENDING SPREE Trudeau's government has spent billions of dollars to stem the fallout from the pandemic, while the Bank of Canada has cut interest rates and purchased bonds to stimulate the economy. Although the central bank has vowed to keep its key interest rate at a record low of 0.25% until economic slack is absorbed, troubling signs have appeared on the horizon. Canada's economic growth slowed in the second quarter and annual inflation spiked in August to an 18-year high, taking some of the wind out of the sails of the Liberal leader's economic argument for reelection. The Canadian dollar  has fallen 1.1% to about 1.2650 per U.S. dollar, or 79.05 U.S. cents, since Trudeau called the election in mid-August, and speculators have turned bearish on the currency for the first time since last December. The market's measure of expected volatility for the currency over a one-week period , a timeframe that covers the election, has climbed to an annualized rate of about 7.5% from less than 5% in August. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index Equities investors are casting a nervous eye over some of the campaign promises made by the parties, including Trudeau's vow to raise corporate taxes on the most profitable banks and insurers to help pay for the cost of the recovery and his pledge to immediately cap oil and gas emissions. ""If it started to lean towards a Liberal majority I would begin to sell energy and banks,"" said Greg Taylor, a portfolio manager at Purpose Investments in Toronto. There is also nervousness over a promise by the Conservatives, the main opposition party, to increase foreign competition in the telecommunications sector as well as a pledge by the Liberals to curb excessive profits from rental housing, which could hurt real estate investment trusts. ""There is a lot of political posturing and rhetoric,"" said Russil Lea, a portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth in Vancouver.

wealth,Scaramucci's SALT hedge fund confab returns in person in New York City," BOSTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A marquee Wall Street conference returns this week, but much like everyone's pandemic-era plans, the event hosted by hedge fund executive and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, will be a little different this year. The SALT event, one of the premier hedge fund industry conferences, kicks off Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York, rather than the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas where organizers hosted the event 10 times before. The annual conference in Las Vegas was famous for pool parties, private rock concerts, and exclusive dinners as managers tried to get commitments for big checks from pension funds or other institutional investors. The Delta variant ??a more infectious version of the original coronavirus ??will force changes at this  year's event in New York where roughly 3,000 signed up after Scaramucci sent ""save the dates"" a few months ago. ""Our goal has always been to empower big, important ideas and foster a community to address shared challenges,"" Scaramucci told Reuters. ""We're also bringing SALT to NYC for the first time to help spur revitalization efforts in the city, and want to demonstrate leadership by returning to some semblance of normalcy while maintaining a safe environment for our attendees."" The founder of SkyBridge Capital became a celebrity beyond Wall Street circles a few years ago, when his 11-day stint as former President Donald Trump's communications director ended due to his heavily publicized criticism of other administration officials. While the virus has tightened restrictions for travel and events, and many of SALT's international guests will be absent, 2,300 still plan to attend in person, the organizers said, noting all attendees must be vaccinated. ""There will be a mood of reserved optimism, but the conference won't have the same flash that it did in Vegas,"" said one person who plans to attend but asked not to be identified for fear of alienating organizers and business associates. Since its founding in 2009, the SALT conference has been a who's who of Wall Street fund managers, bankers, brokers, government officials and celebrities, including top athletes and former heads of state.  Nearly every year they jetted to Vegas, often on private planes. After the pandemic scuttled in-person conferences in 2020, Scaramucci was determined to bring his event back in style. Major speakers include Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, the leading candidate in New York?�s mayoral race, as well as prominent investors like Steven A. Cohen, Daniel Loeb, Ray Dalio, Marc Lasry and Mike Novogratz. The agenda is studded with panels on cryptocurrency trading, post pandemic best ideas and geopolitics. There are some ironies. The Javits Center was a mass vaccination site for people in the New York City area from March until July, with medical staff administering more than 600,000 shots. It typically hosts mega-events like the New York International Auto Show. In the past, SALT boasted performances by top-tier bands like Maroon 5 and Train. This year's musical act is The Chainsmokers, noted for performing at an event in the Hamptons where coronavirus spread. One speaker will be Scaramucci's former White House boss, General John F. Kelly, who fired him. The two now have a close relationship. The backdrop has not dampened enthusiasm from some hedge fund managers who are eager to meet investors, talk to rivals and generally have what they expect will be a fun time. ""I'm glad they are doing it,"" said Jason Mudrick, founder of Mudrick Capital Management, adding ""It is a step in the right direction. We have to get back to things as normally as possible.""

wealth,Brevan Howard expands further into crypto as institutional interest jumps," LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Brevan Howard said on Monday that it was expanding its crypto business, the latest sign that institutional interest in the asset class is gaining momentum. Brevan, more famous for its bets on macroeconomic trends, has been among the most high-profile of major hedge funds moving into the world of crypto trading, known for its volatile markets and scope for outsize gains. The asset manager said it would launch a new unit, BH Digital, to manage cryptocurrency and digital assets. It said it would also hire Colleen Sullivan, currently CEO of the digital arm of trading firm CMT, to lead private and venture investments in crypto. Brevan's expansion comes on the back of other high-profile money managers venturing into this space in recent months. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has invested in bitcoin while Man Group An annual report published by PriceWaterHouseCoopers, Alternative Investment Management Association and Elwood Asset Management found total assets under management of crypto hedge funds globally nearly doubled to $3.8 billion in 2020 from US$2 billion in the previous year. The rise in institutional interest comes as a wider range of cryptocurrencies become available while bitcoin  and ethereum , the world's best known coins, are trading well below their record highs. ""What was initially seen as something of a fad now appears to be becoming a more permanent structure of the financial landscape and this has started to see what were initially fringe financial instruments moving to become more mainstream and very much forcing the institutional interest we are now seeing,"" said Stuart Cole, head macroeconomist at London-based Equiti Capital. The rise in institutional interest has rippled over to the trading space. Eurex, Deutsche Boerse's derivatives exchange, launched bitcoin futures on Monday to feed on the growing interest. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, says institutional interest in trading cryptocurrencies has soared this year. In its second quarter letter to shareholders, Coinbase said turnover of cryptocurrencies hit a record $462 billion in the three months to June. Of this amount, $317 billion was traded by institutional investors and the rest by retail clients. This ratio has flipped from the first quarter of 2018 when retail investors accounted for the lion's share of cryptocurrency trading. While hedge funds and exchanges have scrambled to capture trading revenues, global banks have been relatively slow to latch on to the trend, with their wealth management clients largely pushing them to offer cryptocurrency trading.

wealth,"China launches long-awaited Wealth Connect, wrapping in HK, Macau"," SHANGHAI, Sept 10 (Reuters) - China kicked off on Friday a long-awaited scheme, called Wealth Management Connect, that links its southern province of Guangdong with Hong Kong and Macau, as Beijing moves to pull the two territories closer. The cross-boundary scheme will initially bring combined fund flows of 300 billion yuan ($46.53 billion) in the three areas together known as the Greater Bay Area (GBA), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said. ""The scheme will not only offer more investment options for individual GBA investors but also create new opportunities for the banking and wealth management industry in the three places,"" HKMA chief executive, Eddie Yue, said in a statement. It will also promote cross-border use of the Chinese currency, strengthening Hong Kong's role as the global hub for offshore yuan, Yue added. Twenty Hong Kong banks have expressed interest in participating, said HKMA's deputy chief executive Edmond Lau. ""If the scheme proves popular we could increase the quotas so regulators will have a pragmatic approach,"" he told a media briefing. Global banks and asset managers hailed the launch. ""The WMC scheme is a key milestone in China's financial market liberalisation,"" said Elisa Ng, Hong Kong head of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which has been preparing for the pilot program since it was announced in June last year. Sebastian Paredes, chief executive of DBS Hong Kong, expects the region to provide a quarter of the customers in the bank's Hong Kong Treasures Wealth programme over the next three years. ""We see immense opportunities in expanding our business into China,"" he added. Bank of China (Hong Kong) and the Private Wealth Management Association (PWMA) also welcomed the effort. ""We look forward to engaging with relevant authorities on how to expand the scheme?�s scope in the future,"" Amy Lo, who chairs the executive panel of the Association, said in a statement. EXTRA INCENTIVES China's latest move to further open its financial markets  comes ahead of the imminent launch of the southbound-leg of the Bond Connect for mainland investors to buy offshore debt. The programme enables residents of Hong Kong and Macau to buy mainland investment products sold by banks in the Greater Bay Area, while allowing residents of nine Guangdong cities to buy those sold by banks in the two offshore centres. Eligible wealth management products for mainland investors in the scheme include deposits as well as equity and bond funds in Hong Kong, the HKMA said. Mainland China and Macau announced scheme implementation details separately. Initially, net cash flows in either direction must not exceed 150 billion yuan and the individual investment quota is 1 million yuan. Similar previous initiatives include Stock Connect and Bond Connect, but Wealth Connect is the first cross-boundary scheme focused on the Greater Bay Area, whose combined gross domestic product is similar to that of Australia or South Korea. ""We believe banks with strong onshore and offshore branches in the GBA will enjoy an advantage when leveraging this opportunity,"" Jasper Yip, a partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman, said this week. The news comes days after Beijing gave fresh impetus to developing the region, with new plans for two Guangdong cities, Qianhai and Hengqin. In 2017, President Xi Jinping unveiled plans to turn the region into an economic powerhouse, and integration appears to be accelerating after China imposed a new security law in Hong Kong last year.

wealth,Wells Fargo hit with new $250 mln fine for failure to pay back wronged customers," WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - A top U.S. banking regulator fined Wells Fargo The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the bank had not met the requirements of a 2018 consent order, when the regulator ordered the bank to pay back customers who were charged excessive or improper fees. ""Wells Fargo has not met the requirements of the OCC?�s 2018 action against the bank. This is unacceptable,"" said acting Comptroller Michael Hsu in a statement. Specifically, the OCC said Wells Fargo's efforts to identify and pay back customers who had been previously harmed by the bank were insufficient, citing ""significant deficiencies"" in its earlier attempt. In 2018, Wells Fargo agreed to a joint $1 billion settlement with regulators, who found the bank had wrongly layered insurance on hundreds of thousands of drivers and routinely assessed excessive and improper fees on homebuyers. As part of that earlier consent order, the bank had been directed to create a program to identify wronged customers and pay them restitution. In a statement, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charles Scharf said the new penalty shows more work is needed to address ""significant, longstanding deficiencies.??""Our work to build the right foundation for a company of our size and complexity will not follow a straight line. We are managing multiple issues concurrently, and progress will come alongside setbacks. That said, we believe we?�re making significant progress,"" he added.

wealth,India may let foreign investors buy up to 20% in LIC IPO- source," NEW DELHI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - (This September 8 story corrected first paragraph to show plan refers to purchases in the IPO, not of the company) The Indian government is considering allowing foreign institutional investors to buy up to 20% of state-owned Life Insurance Corporation's initial public offering, a government source said on Wednesday. The listing of LIC is set to be India's biggest ever initial public offering, with the government aiming to raise up to 900 billion rupees ($12.2 billion) from its stake sale. At present, even though foreign institutional investors are allowed to hold up to 74% of private insurance companies and up to 20% of state-owned banks, they are not permitted to own shares in LIC. Enabling this would allow foreign pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds to participate in the IPO of India's largest life insurer. The government is keen to complete the listing this financial year to help with budgetary constraints and late last month selected 10 merchant banks out of the sixteen that had bid to kick-start the process. In total, the merchant banks will earn a fee of around 100 million rupees ($1.36 million), higher than the token fee charged on some IPOs of state-owned firms in the past, but still significantly lower than fees for private listings. For instance, food delivery startup Zomato paid $31 million in fees for listing earlier this year, according to Dealogic. The low fee, however, has not been a deterrent, with nearly all the major banks barring Morgan Stanley queuing up. ""We can?�t care less about what is the money that is being offered.

Russia is experiencing an IPO boom after several barren years following the imposition of sanctions against Moscow after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. UBS earlier predicted a Russian IPO flurry of at least $10 billion this year. Three sources told Reuters Delimobil was targeting an offering this autumn, with two of them saying the company was eyeing a $350 million listing on the New York Stock Exchange and a dual listing in Moscow. Delimobil has previously said it was looking at New York for the offering. Delimobil, one of Russia's biggest car-sharing providers along with Yandex.Drive and others, declined to comment. Three sources said Bank of America and Citi were among the banks picked to arrange the offering. Two sources said UBS, as well as Russia's Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital and Renaissance Capital were the other banks selected. Bank of America, Citi, VTB Capital and Renaissance Capital declined to comment. UBS and Sberbank CIB did not immediately respond to requests. VTB Delimobil, which operates a total fleet of more than 16,000 vehicles in Russia, first announced IPO plans in 2019, saying it would float a 40% stake. The sources did not say whether the $350-million target for this autumn corresponded to 40% of the business. Cian, one of the country's largest real estate databases, is very close to holding a U.S. IPO, three financial market sources said on Tuesday, with two suggesting Nasdaq would be the likely exchange. Cian's offering could be in the region of $300-400 million, two sources said. The company has hired banks to arrange the deal, sources said last month. Other firms targeting imminent U.S. listings include food retailer Vkusvill and the Saint Petersburg Exchange, four sources told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, reported on Tuesday that Vkusvill could be valued between $3-5 billion and the exchange at $2 billion.

wealth,Chinese activist Ai Weiwei says Credit Suisse closing his foundation's bank account," Sept 7 (Reuters) - Chinese dissident and artist Ai Weiwei has said Credit Suisse told him it was closing his foundation's bank account in Switzerland earlier this year citing his ""criminal record"" in China, despite the activist never being convicted of a crime. One of China's most high-profile artists and political activists, Ai, who now lives in Portugal, wrote in an opinion piece for website Artnet how he was first told by the Swiss bank that it would close the account in the spring of this year. ""Credit Suisse initially informed me that they had a new policy to terminate all bank accounts which are related to people with criminal records,"" Ai told Reuters in an emailed statement, adding the foundation had been asked at the time to move the funds before September. The bank declined to comment. Ai helped design the 2008 Beijing Olympics' famed Bird's Nest stadium before falling foul of the communist government, which detained him for 81 days in 2011. He said he has never been formally charged or convicted of a crime. Ai said Credit Suisse then called him on June 24 to say the bank would like to close the account, which belonged to a free speech and arts foundation he started in 2016, ""as soon as possible"". He said managers then referred to an interview he had done with a Swiss newspaper several days before, in which he criticised Swiss people for voting in favour of tighter ""anti-immigrant policies"" as a reason for the closure. Credit Suisse declined to comment on any of his allegations, saying it does not discuss ""potential or existing client relationships"". Ai told Reuters the account was currently in the process of being closed and could only be used in a very limited manner, but funds still needed to be moved out of it. CHINA STRATEGY Many major Western banks, including Credit Suisse, have made winning business from China's ever-growing ranks for the ultra-wealthy a central part of their strategies. However, this has thrown up geopolitical issues for several of them when trying to stay in favour with Beijing. Last year Reuters reported that global wealth managers, including Credit Suisse, were examining whether their clients in Hong Kong had ties to the city's pro-democracy movement, in an attempt to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of China's new national security law. Like other wealth managers, Credit Suisse has made its sponsorship of the arts a selling point with its collecting-savvy clientele, acting as a patron to numerous museums in Switzerland and internationally, while also building up its own collection of more than 8,000 artworks focussed particularly on emerging artists. Ai said he had previously faced similar actions from a bank in Germany and another in Hong Kong, but in neither instance had an explanation been given. ""You know, these banks are very arrogant,"" Ai said, adding he did not believe Credit Suisse would reverse its decision.

wealth,Harvard University to end investment in fossil fuels," BOSTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Harvard University is ending its investments in fossil fuels, the school's president said on Thursday, drawing praise from divestment activists who had long pressed the leading university to exit such holdings. In a letter posted on Harvard's website, President Lawrence Bacow said the school's endowment had no direct investments in  fossil fuel exploration or development companies as of June and will not make such investments in the future, ""given the need to decarbonize the economy."" The university's indirect investments in the fossil fuel industry ""are in runoff mode,"" he added. The indirect investments, made through private equity funds, make up less than 2% of the endowment, Bacow wrote. Recently valued at about $42 billion, the most of any university, the school's endowment has been under pressure for years from students, alumni and other activists to sell off its fossil fuel holdings as a way to slow climate change.

It now carries real-world significance as the lapse of federal unemployment benefits on Sept. 4 brings hope of a surge in job applicants to fill open positions that have kept his company 10% short of its hiring goals despite wage hikes and other incentives. ""We've tried everything. We've tried wage adjustments. We've tried busing people from remote locations ... We are out of initiatives,"" Perkins said, adding he still needs to add around 100 employees to the current workforce of around 1,000. ""I'm hoping that the reduction of (unemployment insurance) has a material impact on workforce availability. That's what we are really banking on."" If the U.S. economy's behavior in 2021 holds any lessons for Perkins, though, he may be disappointed as the hiring needs of firms compete with a The gap between job openings and hiring rates, with From top economic policymakers to human resource chiefs to small business owners with ""help wanted"" signs posted in shop windows, the nationwide expiration of federal unemployment benefits on Saturday has been anticipated as the day when the true state of the U.S. job market becomes apparent, cleared of whatever influence the weekly unemployment payments have had on people's decisions about work. The emerging consensus among economists, however, is that the availability of benefits has mattered less than a host of other pandemic concerns like risks from A 'THAWING' UNDER WAY? About half of U.S. states decided to end the federal benefit during June or July, arguing it kept people from returning to work. There has been little evidence that has emerged since of a surge in job growth, though various studies concluded some reshuffling of the labor market ensued. For instance, the unemployed in states that ended benefits early were slightly more likely to find jobs over the summer. At the same time, those states were less successful in attracting people from the sidelines of the labor market into either employment or a job search. That could mean the labor ""supply shock,"" the human capital element of shortages that have confounded the global economic reopening, continues longer than expected, and the loss of benefits becomes a net drag on growth. States were told by President Joe Biden they could use other federal money to extend the benefits, but none have announced plans to do so yet. ""We don?�t expect the end of emergency (unemployment) benefits to lead to an immediate jump in employment and in the near-term expect it will weigh more on personal income and spending,"" wrote Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. At its peak in May 2020, the unemployment program was funneling an additional $600 a week to 25 million people, a critical $15 billion weekly infusion that kept household incomes intact amid the largest-ever jump in U.S. joblessness and allowed people to buy groceries, pay rents and mortgages, and even splurge on new cars and appliances. It was cut to $300 a week, and the number of recipients is down to around 9.2 million. Efforts to disentangle how that money influenced labor market choices have generally concluded that other factors - fear of the virus or lack of available childcare, for example - have been more top-of-mind. Still, companies hold out hope that David Reilly, president of plastic products maker United Solutions, said monthly job applications at his company's Sardis, Mississippi, plant more than doubled from 40 to 90 between May, before the state axed the federal unemployment payments, and August. He said he has already detected a ""thawing"" at his other location in Leominster, Massachusetts, with applications picking up. ""It's a continuous cycle"" of hiring and recruiting, said Reilly, and one he now hopes will let him get ahead of a curve that has left him about 50 workers short at each of his plants.

wealth,Life insurers shift to pre-pandemic norms after COVID vaccine roll-outs," LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations is making life insurers more enthusiastic about offering cover to those with underlying health conditions - some without even knowing whether customers have been vaccinated. Life insurers were imposing waiting periods to buy cover in the early stages of the pandemic for certain age groups, as well as for those who had been infected, saying the long-term health consequences of coronavirus were not fully understood. But now that vaccines are prevalent in major economies such as Britain and the United States, life insurers see fewer risks. Helen Croft, head of underwriting strategy at AIG Life ""The vaccine take-up has been excellent,"" she said. AIG Life did not check if individual customers have been vaccinated, with Croft pointing out the insurer did not ask customers about other inoculations, such as for flu. ""I don't think it's necessary to be asking about the vaccine - the population level take-up gives us enough comfort,"" she said. Insurers such as LV=, Aviva Regardless of vaccination status, customers with underlying health conditions may pay up to five times the standard rate for life insurance products, sources said. A reduction in the hospitalisation and death rate as a result of vaccination has meant that ""almost all"" insurers in Britain have reversed previous COVID-19 restrictions on life cover, said Phil Jeynes, director of corporate sales at insurance broker Reassured. Britain was one of the first countries to roll out a vaccination programme and almost 80% of all over-16s are fully vaccinated, according to UK government figures. Premiums have stayed much the same during the pandemic, Jeynes added. Rather than raising rates, insurers postponed providing cover for those above a certain age, with some underlying health conditions or who were recovering from COVID-19, industry sources said. Life insurance premium volumes dropped by 11% in Britain and by 0.1% in the United States in 2020, according to Swiss Re. Sharp falls in household incomes due to lockdowns and job losses hit demand for life insurance last year, the reinsurer said in a recent report. Swiss Re expects strong life insurance growth this year and next due to the economic recovery and increased consumer awareness of risk. In the United States, where more than half of the population is vaccinated, major life insurers Prudential Financial The Insurance Compact, standards adopted by 47 U.S. states, said it did not currently allow insurers to ask vaccination questions as state insurance regulation has not yet set public policy around the vaccine and underwriting. ASKING QUESTIONS However, some insurers in Britain are asking customers whether they have been inoculated, particularly if their health condition makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19, and this could affect the cost or size of their cover. ""For those that have been fully vaccinated, our risk appetite will be higher,"" said Rose St Louis, protection director at Scottish Widows. ""We may be able to offer improved terms to those who have had both vaccines."" Legal & General ""To avoid postponing applications for this 1% of new customers, we will now ask whether or not they have had their required vaccine doses...allowing us to give cover to customers when it would otherwise not be available,"" an L&G spokesperson said by email. Unvaccinated vulnerable customers would be declined cover for now, though allowances would be made for those who could not have the shot for medical reasons such as pregnancy, L&G said. Insurers need to get clearance from their reinsurers for any underwriting changes they make, as reinsurers may otherwise be unwilling to provide that cover. L&G said its reinsurers agreed with its approach, without naming them. One global reinsurer, who declined to be identified, said it was supporting the stance of ""several insurers"" in Britain who were insuring customers in higher risk medical groups for larger amounts of cover, if the customers provided evidence that they were fully vaccinated. Clive Allison, director, life and pensions at consultants EY, said the need for vaccine questions may be short-lived. ""There'll be a convergence where most adults will have been double-vaccinated,"" he said. ""The ones that haven't are most likely to be in the younger age bracket, and typically are not looking to take out insurance cover.""

wealth,Analysis: Wells Fargo's long road to repair extends with prospect of more penalties," WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - It has been nearly five years since Wells Fargo & Co Regulators at two key agencies ??the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ??are considering additional sanctions against Wells Fargo because it has been too slow to compensate victims and address underlying weaknesses in business practices, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The bank also remains under an unprecedented asset cap that the Federal Reserve imposed, as well as roughly a dozen consent orders with regulators, all stemming from a sales scandal that erupted publicly in September 2016. OCC, CFPB, Fed and Wells Fargo spokespeople declined to comment. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf has pledged to get Wells Fargo on the right track and resolve regulatory issues as quickly as possible. But after news of more potential penalties, analysts predicted it could take him years to achieve those goals. ""Wells Fargo didn't get into this situation overnight and they surely won't get out of it overnight,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading. Wells Fargo?�s shares were down 4.6% on Wednesday afternoon, following a sharp decline on Tuesday. The bank?�s issues stem from a pervasive culture under prior management, where hitting sales targets was the most important element for employee success. As a result, the bank ended up enrolling customers in millions of phony accounts and many more products, sometimes charging unnecessary fees or harming their credit ratings. Wells Fargo?�s management team and board have changed dramatically since then, implementing new incentive structures and risk-management protocol across the bank. Scharf became CEO in October 2019, the fourth person to lead Wells Fargo since the scandal emerged. Scharf has repeatedly emphasized the urgency of resolving regulatory issues, fixing internal risk and control structures,  and restoring Wells Fargo?�s reputation with customers, investors and other stakeholders. The catchphrase on his corporate biography is, ?�We will get it done.??However, Scharf has resisted offering a hard timeline, saying that problems ran deep within the bank and that regulators will ultimately decide when and whether they are resolved. ?�The amount of customer remediation and control-related issues that existed when I arrived was many multiples of what should exist at our company,??he told analysts during a conference call in July. The bank flagged difficulties satisfying regulators in its quarterly filing in May, and Scharf said he was ""not even thinking about what life is like without the asset cap."" The asset cap, $1.95 trillion, is important because it limits Wells Fargo?�s ability to lend and invest, and therefore its ability to earn profits. Wells Fargo held $1.945 trillion in total assets as of June 30. Analysts struggled to predict how long it will take Wells to fully move past the sales scandal. Boltansky was encouraged that the unresolved issues still appear to stem from prior practices, rather than new abuses coming to light. On the other hand, the Biden administration has positioned itself as getting tougher on policies for large U.S. companies, including banks, and it is unclear how the White House will handle upcoming appointments to regulators including the Fed. Few analysts expect Wells can resolve the asset cap or consent orders any time soon.

wealth,Bank of Montreal's revenues drive earnings beat; Scotiabank relies on provisions," TORONTO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) Its earnings beat in the three months through July was propelled almost entirely by lower-than-expected provisions for credit losses, with pre-tax, pre-provision earnings (PTPP) missing estimates as net interest margins declined in its international banking unit. BMO's better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong revenues thanks to fee growth in Canadian banking and capital markets, with an added boost from the C$70 million ($55.53 million) it released from reserves to cover potential bad loans. Both had strong wealth management growth. BMO's shares rose 1.75% to C$130.97 on Tuesday morning, on track for a record close, while Scotiabank's fell 0.1% to C$80.16. The Toronto stock benchmark gained 0.3%. ""Scotiabank's PTPP miss was of particular concern, mostly for international banking, which we continue to view as key to a potential rerating of (its) valuation,"" Credit Suisse analyst Mike Rizvanovic wrote in a note. BMO's strong quarter was driven by ""strength in the bank?�s top-line that drove a much better-than-forecast PTPP result,"" he said. While declining provisions continue to drive earnings, Canadian bank investors are looking for signs of improvement in lending, particularly as capital markets businesses, which have helped lift profits over the last few quarters, had a mixed performance. In Canada, Scotiabank's 7% year-on-year loan growth at home, driven by both mortgage and business lending, helped offset a 12% decline in loans overseas. While BMO's Canadian loans increased 5.4% from a year ago, with much of that driven by mortgages, U.S. lending fell 11%. Executives at both banks expressed optimism for continued lending recovery, despite elevated deposit levels. Those balances helped Scotiabank's Canadian loan write-offs return to below pre-pandemic levels, with write-offs in its international unit expected to return to normal by next quarter, executives said on an analyst call. Continued pick-up in loan growth will also be a tailwind against the impact on margins of a flatter yield curve, BMO executives said on their call. Scotiabank's pre-tax pre-provision (PTPP) earnings were down 1% both from a year ago and from the previous quarter as net interest margins in its Latin America-focused international banking business fell.

wealth,Glass Lewis backs one of Starboard's three nominees in Box proxy fight," NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Friday recommended that investors in cloud storage vendor Box elect one of Starboard Value's three proposed nominees to the board, arguing change is needed after a ""puzzling"" capital raise and ""reactive governance"" changes. Glass Lewis is backing Peter Feld, a partner at Starboard, owner of an 8.4 stake in Box The report criticizes Box's board for having supported a $500 million convertible preferred offering led by private equity firm KKR For Starboard, the KKR deal has become the centerpiece of its broader criticism that Box has a poor track record of being a public company and has failed to deliver on its commitments in spite of its strong product positioning. Starboard has also told the board that it should fire Chief Executive Aaron Levie and find a buyer for the company. This year's campaign marks the second time in two years that Starboard, one of the industry's busiest activists with a history of winning more board seats than its rivals, has taken aim at Box. The hedge fund reached a settlement with the company in March 2020 that allowed it to choose one director and have input in choosing a second. Both of those directors have assumed leadership roles on the board. Starboard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Box said the report ignores ""that Peter Feld has been insistent on firing Box?�s CEO in the absence of a sale, demonstrating his unwillingness to be open minded."" Glass Lewis and its larger rival Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) are often instrumental in determining the outcome of boardroom battles over who sits on a board by making recommendations that many big investors like mutual funds follow. ISS issued its report earlier this week and came to a different conclusion, recommending that investors back the company's nominees instead, not Starboard's directors. While ISS says that Starboard deserves credit for operational and governance changes made since last year's settlement, it also adds that the current board deserves more time to allow its changes to take hold.

wealth,Column: Wall Street boom or bubble? Don't blame it all on the Fed," Aug 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street is screeching to yet another all-time high, just as the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium is set to address wealth inequality and the central bank's role in fueling asset price inflation is once again coming under harsh scrutiny. It is undeniable that trillions of dollars of asset purchases and years of official interest rates of zero and 10-year bond yields barely above 1% have boosted stock prices. But the significance of Fed actions are overstated. The tech-heavy composition of Wall Street, which benefits more from low interest rates and plain old stronger economic growth, are adding fuel to the U.S. stock surge. And the Fed's large balance sheet expansion is nowhere near the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan's. Look no further than Wall Street: The S&P 500 According to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, only 1964 and 1995 had more than 50 new highs by the end of August. He reckons the S&P 500 could make 78 new highs this year, eclipsing the all-time record of 77 set in 1995. On a 12-month forward earnings valuation basis, the S&P 500 earlier this year was its most expensive since 1999, just before the tech bubble burst. This price/earnings ratio has since drifted lower. But it is still above 20, which is unfamiliar territory for most of the last two decades. Official interest rates and ultra-low benchmark bond yields make investing in profitable, cash-generating companies an attractive proposition. To some investors desperate for return, riskier stocks are a no-brainer. Many argue there is a natural consequence of the Fed doubling the size of its balance sheet to $8.3 trillion since the pandemic outbreak. As a share of GDP, that is now around 40%. With stocks and other financial assets mostly in the hands of society's better off, critics say U.S. monetary policy is widening the gap between rich and poor and directly exacerbating wealth inequality. The world's second and third largest central banks, meanwhile, have also ramped up their pandemic-fighting asset purchases. Their balance sheets, as a share of GDP, are far bigger than the Fed's. Yet stock markets and valuations in the euro zone and Japan are nowhere near as high. ""The commonly held narrative centers on the Fed, and if everyone believes that, then it is self-reinforcing,"" said Meb Faber, co-founder and chief investment officer at Cambria Investments in El Segundo, California. ""But there is a limit as to how far you can extrapolate that."" The ECB has grown its balance sheet to $9.5 trillion since the outbreak of the pandemic. The ECB's balance sheet is now worth more than 60% of euro zone GDP. Similarly, the Bank of Japan has grown its balance sheet by $1.4 trillion since March 2020 to $6.6 trillion, around 120% of GDP. Yet the euro Stoxx 50 Japan's Topix Both figures, again, are significantly below their U.S. equivalents, suggesting factors other than central bank largesse are behind Wall Street's surge. For one, the U.S. equity market is far more tech- and digital-heavy than its global peers. A world of zero interest rates benefits tech companies disproportionately because a low discount rate inflates future cash flows for companies where cutting edge innovation is likely to fuel faster growth. By any measure, the big five tech 'FAANG' stocks - Facebook Another is good old-fashioned economic growth. Some of the more bullish U.S. forecasts have been trimmed recently, but the International Monetary Fund expects 7.0% GDP growth in the United States this year, 4.6% in the euro zone, and just 2.8% in Japan. On top of that, Corporate America is motoring along nicely. LPL Financial's Detrick notes that some 85% of S&P 500 companies posted second quarter earnings beats. And 2021 consensus earnings per share estimates are for a 43% jump from last year. ""The Fed backstop helps explain why people are willing to pay higher multiples. But higher earnings are higher earnings, and that justifies a lot. Investors still see better opportunity in the U.S., and are willing to pay that premium,"" he said.

wealth,HSBC snaps up Axa Singapore assets for $575 mln in Asia expansion," SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings HSBC said in a statement that the combined unit comprising HSBC Life Singapore and Axa Singapore would be the seventh-largest life insurer and the fourth-largest retail health insurer in Singapore, with over 600,000 policies in-force covering life, health and property and casualty insurance. HSBC currently ranks 10th in life insurance in Singapore, and does not have a health insurance business. The Asia-focused bank, like its peers, is battling poor returns from lending in a low interest rate environment and is looking to boost customer fee income in areas such as insurance and asset management. It said in February it would invest $3.5 billion in its wealth and personal banking business in Asia, which includes its insurance operations, part of an overall investment in the region of $6 billion. ""This transaction gives the scale and the capability to continue to invest and grow from here,"" Bryce Johns, global CEO of HSBC Life and Insurance partnerships, told Reuters in an interview on Monday. The deal is HSBC's largest acquisition since the $726 merger of its Oman branch with Oman International Bank in 2012, according to Dealogic. AXA, which also is struggling with low interest rates, is streamlining its business and withdrawing from areas where it lacks scale. HSBC will already be familiar with part of its new assets having After exiting retail banking in the U.S. and France this year, HSBC Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn said last month the bank was looking at three or four ""bolt on"" acquisitions in Asia outside China in areas including insurance and asset management. Singapore, one of Asia's biggest offshore wealth hubs, is also a regional base for thousands of global companies. Last year, Singapore Life, an upstart insurer backed by investors including buyout group TPG and insurer Sumitomo Life, acquired the Singapore business of British insurer Aviva Axa said the deal with HSBC was subject to regulatory approvals and would probably close by the fourth quarter. The Singapore unit had net assets of $474 million at the end of 2020, annualised new premiums of $85 million and gross written premiums of $739 million. HSBC said Axa Singapore would provide it access to a sizeable tied-agency sales force, many leading independent financial advisory firms, and a large pool of insurance policyholders and corporate relationships.

wealth,"Investors storm into ""value trades"" as broader equity exuberance fades"," LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Investors have made a beeline into so-called ""value trades"", adding cash into European stocks and financial and material shares during the past week, BofA's weekly statistics showed on Friday, keeping the region's markets on a record-breaking run. At $1.5 billion, Europe saw the biggest inflow in eight weeks while financial stocks saw a chunky $2.6 billion of inflows, the largest in 10 weeks, the U.S. investment bank said. European stocks hit new highs on Friday and looked set to extend gains for a record tenth straight session. ""We say own defensive quality in second half,"" said Michael Hartnett, BofA's chief investment strategist The renewed interest in relatively cheaper sectors of the market came at the cost of the familiar market darlings including technology stocks which saw their smallest inflows in seven weeks. Materials and financials stocks are considered relatively undervalued currently as they are perceived to be still suffering from the pandemic-induced economic downturn. But analysts believe their fortunes will turn if larger economies continue to recover. Global equity funds enjoyed inflows of $15.7 billion as private clients of the U.S. investment bank holding $3.2 trillion in assets increased their allocation to stocks to a record high of 65%. Market participants say the single most important factor for them is what the U.S. FederalReserve will do next as it looks to gradually roll back emergency pandemic measures,but inflation data this week has been fairly confusing for market watchers. BoFA noted the cost of shipping a 40-foot box container from Shanghai to Rotterdam has jumped to $14,000 from $2,000, 18 months ago.

wealth,Fund managers position for transitory U.S. inflation," MUMBAI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Based on expectations that U.S. inflation will be transitory and that the Federal Reserve will clearly communicate its plans to taper asset purchases, major global fund managers say they remain invested in risky assets. Fund managers interviewed on the Reuters Global Markets Forum since last week appeared to concur that the Fed may give more weight to employment data than inflation but held divergent views on when and how the Fed would announce a taper. UBS Global Wealth Management was positioning for some inflation, chief investment officer (CIO) Mark Haefele said. ""It's a little bit of a barbell in the sense that we don't think inflation is going to get out of hand,"" he added. Haefele is betting on the reflation trade - trades that outperform during periods of quick economic growth - as the world works through the Delta variant of the coronavirus. His investment picks include energy and financial stocks and Japanese equities. Rahul Chaddha, global CIO at Mirae Asset Global Investments, reckoned deflation would likely be a bigger concern for the Fed in the medium-term. Data on Wednesday hinted that U.S. inflation may have peaked, which could support the Fed's contention that the surge in prices will be temporary. The Fed will be ""happy to live with periods of high inflation"" to kickstart the investment cycle, Chaddha said. Chaddha believes there could be some sell-off in cyclically geared stocks as bond yields rise in the near term, but reflation trades would regain their appeal in the medium-term as the Fed caps yields and stays behind the curve. TAPER TIMING The biggest concerns for fund managers were around the Delta variant and the effect of a slowing China. ""We saw in 2016 what the impact of the slowdown in Chinese growth can have on the rest of the world,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, head of retail multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. ""Taper is going to be delayed."" Haefele did not expect ""tremendous clarity"" from the Fed anytime soon, and said average inflation targeting gave the U.S. central bank ""more room"" to be lenient. AIA group CIO Mark Konyn, however, expects the Fed to announce tapering by November or December this year, based on Chair Jerome Powell's remarks about the underlying strength of the labour market. ""The Fed is facing a sort of 'hard deadline' to announce tapering in 2021,"" Konyn said. A sharp decline in the U.S. fiscal deficit will reduce the volume of Treasury securities' issuance, which could lead to market volatility if the Fed continues bond-buying at its current levels, Konyn added. Jim Leaviss, CIO of public fixed income at M&G Investments, expects the Fed to announce its taper plan sooner, during its ""live"" September meeting, and start cutting asset purchases by November this year.

wealth,Analysis: Shoots of greenflation spring new challenges on portfolio managers," LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - From container ships to cardboard, tighter environmental regulations are stoking shortages and price spikes as 'greenflation' takes a grip, adding a new twist to corporate valuations. For all the inflation-is-transitory messages from central banks, double or triple-digit cost increases have become common on company balance sheets, although the green variety has yet to show up in bond markets, the usual early warning system. While higher costs are partly down to pandemic-linked supply glitches, fund managers say a powerful impetus is emanating from stringent new rules to guide the world's transition to a greener future. And these may outlast the COVID-19 inflation narrative. To slash greenhouse gas emissions, the European Union will lift the cost of emitting carbon for transport and factories, ditch sales of gasoline-fuelled cars and slap carbon levies on trade partners. Aluminium, electricity and fertiliser are among sectors targeted, with others such as aviation in the EU crosshairs. Investors largely agree greenflation is a necessary risk, because with the United Nations saying global warming is spiralling out of the control, the alternative of frequent floods, droughts and forest fires is worse. The question facing fund managers is which companies will see a profit hit, which can pass costs on and which will thrive. For Peter Rutter, head of equities at Royal London Asset Management, the solution lies in modelling how, for instance, carbon dynamics may impact cash flow, revenues and share prices. ""We are big believers in greenflation. There are scenarios that take assets out of use, like cars that can no longer be driven or ships that are not allowed into certain ports."" ""The other element is the injection of additional costs. If companies can pass on the costs, it's inflationary. If not, it adds inflation to production and hurts margins,"" Rutter added. Company earnings are reflecting higher input costs. But it is hard to say which are environment-related. U.S. retailer Home Depot And packaged foods company Conagra BofA analysts tallied references to ""inflation"" during the latest-quarter earnings calls and estimate they rose 1000% year-on-year for companies in the S&P 500 GROWING A TREE In shipbuilding, for instance, orders have plunged, which officials attribute partly to uncertainty over which technology to adopt for alternative fuels. . New vessels take up to three years to deliver and typically operate for more than 20 years, by which time high-emission ships may be unviable. And if shipping is added to carbon markets, owners must buy permits or risk port bans. That may support already elevated freight costs Similarly, tighter forestry regulations and the closure of polluting Chinese foundries are impacting timber and metal prices, PIMCO fund manager Geraldine Sundstrom noted. ""It takes time to grow a tree,"" Sundstrom said. ""In a green and digital world, you need to position in the right place, where there are barriers to entry and therefore pricing power."" Sundstrom reckons sectors such as integrated forestries and shipping could enjoy significant price gains ""as markets are still betting on prices mean-reverting."" There will be losers too. World stocks could suffer a 20% setback if carbon prices -- the price companies pay to pollute -- rise by $75 per tonne, recent research by Kempen Capital Management, which manages 86 billion euros, estimates. Within sectors, carbon-intense firms will lose out as border taxes on carbon kick in, BofA says. Hydropower-reliant aluminium producers Norsk Hydro, Rusal and Rio Tinto with a carbon footprint of four tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of metal, are better placed than Chinese smelters with 16 tonnes of emissions, it added. TURNOVER So does this mean higher inflation for the broader economy? Greenflation will not last forever as carbon pricing effects will be spread over years, while the adoption of renewables should gradually cut power generation costs. Yet that ""deflationary turnover"" will take time, Morgan Stanley analysts said. Prices for carbon emission allowances have more than doubled this year, which Morgan Stanley estimated had raised euro zone retail electricity prices by 8% by June and added 23 basis points to inflation. A rise to 100 euros will boost retail power prices 12%, it says. And clean energy faces costs of its own, with electrical equipment, wind turbines and fuel cells exposed to higher metals and shipping prices. Michael Herzum, head of strategy at Germany's Union Investment, said price jumps are inevitable as carbon will be priced at a high enough level to incentivise change. While the effect should wane over time, Herzum said that the green transformation will reinforce a ""40 year period of disinflation has come to an end"". Our Standards: Investment in renewable energy needs to triple by the end of the decade if the world hopes to effectively fight climate change and keep volatile energy markets under control, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday."

wealth,Column: Plan to add dental care to U.S. Medicare is a game-changer for seniors," CHICAGO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Almost half of Americans enrolled in Medicare did not visit a dentist in 2018. That is a problem that goes far beyond having white teeth or a beautiful smile - poor dental care can exacerbate serious chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The low frequency of dental visits surfaced in a recent report by the Kaiser Family Foundation. It points to a fundamental gap in Medicare coverage - one that Democrats in the U.S. Congress hope to close as part of the $3.5 trillion Traditional Medicare pays for dental care only when it is deemed necessary as part of a covered procedure ??for example, a tooth extraction needed in preparation for radiation treatment. The program does not cover hearing aids or exams, or most vision care. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer some level of dental, vision and hearing care, but most plans cap annual dollar coverage at levels that will not protect enrollees from more expensive procedures and care. All three types of coverage are critical to good health. Health researchers have linked poor dental care to higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and pulmonary infections. And they have found that vision and hearing loss are associated with a higher risk of falls, depression and cognitive impairment. Seniors face especially high out-of-pocket costs for dental care, especially for pricier procedures such as implants. Medicare Advantage plans typically cover both preventive care, like oral exams, cleanings and x-rays, and more extensive benefits for procedures such as fillings, extractions and root canals. Advantage enrollees often get these dental benefits without paying an additional premium. That is possible because Advantage plans operate under a complex system of payments that include bonuses paid to plans by the government based on quality ratings, and rebates. Advantage plans are required to spend part of these bonus payments directly on care for beneficiaries. And a HIGH OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS Extra benefits such as dental have helped fuel the rapid growth of Advantage plans. The Congressional Budget Office forecast recently that Advantage plans will account for half of all Medicare enrollment by 2025 - double what it was in 2010. But Kaiser found that the average annual limit on dental coverage among Advantage plans that offer more extensive benefits is about $1,300 this year, and 59% of enrollees in these plans have dental benefits that are capped at $1,000 or less. Some seniors purchase commercial dental policies, but these plans also come with coverage caps similar to those found in Advantage plans. The bill for extensive dental procedures often exceeds these caps. A patient needing a combination of extractions, root canals and crowns might easily pay upwards of $4,000, data from the American Dental Association shows. High out-of-pocket costs explain why so many seniors simply go without dental care. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries in 2019 was just $29,650, Kaiser reports. A The racial gaps in care are equally appalling. Kaiser found that 68% of Black beneficiaries - and 61% of Latino beneficiaries - did not visit a dentist in the past year. ?�People of color who are on Medicare are disproportionately low-income, so even if they have a dental benefit through Advantage, they may find dental care unaffordable,??said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Medicare policy program at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ?�This does appear to be a health equity issue, based on what we?�re seeing with people not going to the dentist at all in a given year.??Senate Democrats aim to add dental, vision and hearing care to Medicare through the The reconciliation bill is so sweeping in scope that a change like this easily flies under the radar. But it would be the most positive change made to Medicare in many years. (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

wealth,Analysis: UN climate report increases urgency for green investment funds," Aug 10 (Reuters) - Dire warnings about climate change are a call to action for investors who put their money into helping the environment. But the news also heightens a debate about how to make these strategies effective, financial executives said. A U.N climate report on Monday found that global warming is dangerously close to spiraling out of control. Even the most severe carbon emission cuts are unlikely to prevent global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures by 2040, a level that many scientists believe must be achieved to avert catastrophic climate change. Green investing has attracted a flood of cash and boosted companies like electric car maker Tesla Inc But sustainable investment managers are confronting a two-sided challenge for ESG, or environmental, social and governance, funds. Fund managers want to convert public enthusiasm into dollars invested while simultaneously allaying suspicions that some funds are ""greenwashed"" as skeptics claim. ""Not all ESG funds are created equal and investors must do their research to determine whether their investments are making a real impact or are simply feeding into an ESG-centered marketing push,"" said Green Century Capital Management President Leslie Samuelrich. NEW GREEN HIGH Globally, sustainable funds hit a record high of $2.24 trillion in assets in the second quarter, Morningstar data showed, up 12% from the end of March. Many of these funds choose their investments in part on ratings of portfolio companies' sustainability assigned by outside firms, but these grades can diverge widely. An association of global market regulators took the first step last month towards governing the ratings. L8N2OZ2YS The U.N. report will further pressure funds to make their climate disclosures more transparent, said R. Paul Herman, chief executive of sustainable ratings agency HIP Investor. Another challenge is finding green investment opportunities in emerging markets, which have fallen behind in curbing emissions. China, for example, said last year it would seek carbon neutrality by 2060, a decade later than other top economies. Just 2% of the money tracked by Morningstar has gone to funds based in Asian countries other than Japan. Randeep Somel, manager of the M&G Climate Solutions Fund in London ""Once governments start to move in emerging markets, you will see companies moving more quickly,"" Somel said. HOW TO HANDLE FOSSIL FUEL? One of the biggest questions is whether to invest in fossil fuels at all. An increasing number of asset managers, such as Green Century, and pension funds, such as those of Maine and New York City, have said they won't. Others argue it is better to work with energy companies to spur change. ""It's easy to exclude coal companies or bad actors from your portfolio and only invest in companies that are green. The real impact comes from taking high carbon emitters and forcing them to modify their behavior,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer of Angeles Investment Advisors. Angeles, which manages $7 billion in assets, would still own an oil company if it took climate change seriously, Rosen added. Mark Hays, director of sustainable investing for Glenmede of Philadelphia, said an earlier UN climate report in 2019 drew attention from mainstream investors. Monday's report could spur more action, he said. Climate change ""is going to be increasingly financially material to your investment portfolio,"" Hays said.

wealth,"AIG profit beats estimates on general insurance, retirement gains"," Aug 5 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc The U.S. insurer posted underwriting income of $463 million in its general insurance business in the quarter, compared with a loss of $343 million a year earlier, when it booked large losses related to the pandemic. The business saw $118 million of catastrophe losses, compared to $674 million in the prior year. Global insurers last year faced a sharp rise in payouts related to the health crisis, but many have now seen a fall in coronavirus-related claims as vaccines roll out. Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG's common shareholders rose to $1.33 billion in the quarter ended June 30, from $561 million a year earlier. Excluding items, AIG earned $1.52 per share, exceeding analysts' estimates of $1.20, according to Refinitiv IBES. The company's general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes catastrophe losses - was 91.1 for the quarter, compared with 94.9 a year earlier. A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Gross premiums written rose 12% to $9.5 billion in the general insurance business. AIG's life and retirement unit posted a 26% jump in adjusted pre-tax income to $1.12 billion, driven partly by higher private equity returns.

wealth,MetLife's quarterly profit beats estimates on investment boost," Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc Metlife reported adjusted earnings of $2.1 billion, or $2.37 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, from $758 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.62 per share, according to data from Refinitiv IBES. The New York-based insurer said in May that the worst of the pandemic was behind it, as a rebound in investment income helped global life insurers offset some of the impact from payouts related to the health crisis.

The bill was among 11 that lawmakers hope will address failings highlighted by March's meltdown of family office Archegos Capital which led to billions of dollars in losses for some banks and January's GameStop saga. Whether they pass or not, the bills considered by the House Financial Services Committee would increase the pressure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take swift action, analysts said. The legislation targets family offices with more than $750 million in assets, retail trading practices and short selling.

wealth,"Explainer: Major Ethereum upgrade set to alter supply, fix transaction fees"," NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, is about to undergo a technical adjustment that will significantly alter the way transactions are processed, as well as reduce the supply of the ether token and sharply boost its price. The scheduled coding revamp will go live on Aug. 4. The upgrade known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 is similar, analysts said, to a bitcoin ""halving"" event in which periodic adjustments reduced the supply of bitcoin. Each halving helped propel bitcoin's price to higher records. While bitcoin is the preferred store of value in the digital ecosystem, Ethereum has emerged as the leading financial infrastructure, settling over $12 billion of daily transactions, according to a Grayscale report released in February this year. Andrew Keys, managing partner at DARMA Capital, said ether's current price has yet to factor in the looming software upgrade. He estimates that the expected software adjustment next week, coupled with another upgrade in the first quarter of 2022, should ""easily quintuple the price of ether"" by next year. On Thursday, ether was up 0.6% at $2,312 . WHAT IS EIP 1559? EIP-1559 is a software upgrade that fundamentally changes the way transactions are processed on Ethereum by providing clear pricing on transaction fees in ether paid to miners to validate transactions and ""burning"" a small amount of those tokens. The burned tokens will be permanently taken out of circulation. In token burning, miners would typically send the tokens to specialized addresses that have unobtainable private keys. Without access to a private key, no one can use the tokens, putting them outside the circulating supply. By reducing the number of tokens, the currencies that remain in circulation become rarer and more valuable. WHAT IS THE CURRENT PRACTICE ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN? Currently, a person or entity trying to send a transaction on the Ethereum network must pay a so-called ""gas fee"" in ether to miners to process their transactions. But the exact transaction fee is not clear and market participants say there is no way of knowing the price beforehand. This creates two issues, said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management. ""First, it introduces a major uncertainty around whether you'll get your transaction processed in a timely fashion,"" he said. ""Second, people overpay because they don't know the clearing price and they bid too much to make sure the transaction is processed."" WILL MINING, BUYING AND SELLING ETHER BECOME EASIER? EIP-1559 changes this mechanism by setting a ""base fee"" paid to miners for each transaction, part of which will be burned. Participants can also include an optional ""tip"" with their base fee to speed up the process, if desired. Another adjustment, market players said, is doubling the amount of space available in each block. Blockchains like Ethereum settle transactions in batches or blocks. Each block can contain only a certain number of transactions. Blocks are propagated on Ethereum every 17 seconds and EIP 1599 is going to be deployed on Block 12,965,000, which is estimated to happen on Aug. 4, said DARMA'S Keys. There was a bug bounty, which paid people if they found bugs. That has process has been completed. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ETHER SUPPLY? Bitwise's Hougan cited estimates that EIP-1599 will reduce ether's overall inflation rate from roughly 4% a year to 3%.  That is about half as large a reduction proportionately seen in bitcoin ""halving"" events, he said. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INVESTORS? The change should make it easier for investors to understand the value of holding ether. Hougan said EIP 1559 should increase transactions on the Ethereum network and raise the use of ether, which will likely help bring a wave of institutional investors into the market.

wealth,France's BNP bolsters profit as state softens pandemic blow," PARIS, July 30 (Reuters) - France's biggest listed lender BNP Paribas Although the virus continues to loom over the global economy, billions of euros of state handouts across Europe, from worker furlough schemes to assistance for businesses, have helped borrowers keep up repayments, shielding banks' profits. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said he was preparing for a ""solid recovery"" after the euro zone's biggest lender on Friday reported a 26.6% jump in second-quarter net income. The government ended France?�s third national lockdown in mid-May and has been gradually relaxing other restrictions since. Like other European countries, France borrows to pay for public spending, which it has ramped up dramatically during the pandemic. The national public auditor has said Paris should gradually withdraw COVID-19 support this year and next but only turn to cut its budget deficit from 2023. This would postpone any economic hangover from the pandemic, a boon to borrowers and banks, as well as their shareholders. Spain's BBVA ""Clearly they are benefiting from massive state support. It is support for the economy, the borrowers. So they benefit indirectly,"" said Jerome Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments. BNP Paribas posted a net profit of 2.91 billion euros as its cost of risk, reflecting provisions for bad loans, fell 43.8% to 813 million euros. Revenue rose 0.9%, as a 9.5% rebound in retail banking helped make up for lower corporate and investment banking sales. The pandemic has also influenced the behaviour of its customers. Deposits, for instance, rose by 7.5% compared with a year earlier, as lockdowns made it harder to spend, while loans were up by 4%. Lockdowns and curfews accelerated a shift to online banking, with a jump of a quarter in daily connections to mobile apps, the bank said. The general improvement in retail banking helped offset a slump of more than 40% in earnings in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. In corporate banking, where BNP Paribas has been making a push on advising clients on mergers, revenue was down 1.6%, lagging Wall Street rivals. The bank said business volumes in finance raised for clients on credit, bond and equity markets was down 37%. It also said it would pay shareholders an additional dividend of 1.55 euro per share this year, and its shares, up about a fifth this year, rose again on Friday, though lagged the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index Our Standards: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters."

wealth,Credit Suisse's Archegos post mortem slams management; profit slumps," ZURICH, July 29 (Reuters) - A ""lackadaisical"" attitude towards risk and ""a lack of accountability"" were to blame for Credit Suisse's The collapse of Archegos rocked Wall Street in March as its highly leveraged stock bets went sour, sending banks scrambling for the exit. In a $10 billion bloodbath, Credit Suisse was the biggest loser, a devastating double whammy for a bank already reeling from the insolvency of a key associate, Greensill Capital. Archegos is still hitting Credit Suisse's bottom line. Net profit of 253 million Swiss francs ($278.45 million) missed average forecasts for 334 million Swiss francs as it absorbed an additional $653 million loss from the fund's collapse and amid a general slump in trading. In a damning assessment of what went wrong, an independent review unveiled along with the results on Thursday repeatedly criticizedthe bank's risk management practices, though it did add there was no evidence of fraudulent or illegal activity. ""The Archegos-related losses sustained by Credit Suisse (CS) are the result of a fundamental failure of management and controls in CS's Investment Bank and, specifically, in its Prime Services business. The business was focused on maximizing short-term profits and failed to rein in and, indeed, enabled Archegos's voracious risk-taking,"" the 165-page review by law firm Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrisson said. (To read the report, click The bank said in response that it would ""put risk management at the heart of our decision-making processes"". Shares of the bank pared early losses to trade down 2.4% by 1045 GMT, taking their losses to 22% so far this year. The European bank index Analysts had expected a nearly 600 million franc hole caused by more losses at Archegos and further weakness in the bank's trading and advisory businesses to bring second-quarter net profit down to a quarter of its value a year ago. Excluding Archegos and other significant items, Credit Suisse said pre-tax income would have dropped 11%. Credit Suisse said action has been taken against 23 staff over Archegos, with nine fired and a total of $70 million in monetary penalties taken from all of them. Under new Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, it is trying to turn the page after a swathe of investigations, executive changes, and divisional reshuffles. Management is promising to unveil a strategic overhaul by year-end. An exodus of senior dealmakers and traders from its investment bank, and plans to reduce risk in its prime brokerage unit, have made the changes especially felt within that division. The bank said on Thursday that a provisional capital buffer for Archegos has been removed, but a buffer for Greensill remained. It said it was in advanced talks with some creditors to recover some of the $10 billion of client investments linked to Greensill. It also said it had been accruing for dividends during the quarter but the size of the payout had yet to be determined. ""Management provided some reassurance on the call suggesting this quarter's focus was on dealing with the fall-out of Archegos and Greensill, but we could potentially return to a more 'business as usual' quarter as early as 3Q21,"" Citi analyst Andrew Coombs wrote in a note. LEADING WEALTH MANAGER WITH A CULTURE PROBLEM Investors have been waiting to see whether troubles at Credit Suisse, which have also left clients in its asset management business directly exposed to potential Greensill losses, have affected prized relationships with the ultra-wealthy. Credit Suisse on Thursday reported 7.3 billion francs in net asset outflows from its wealth management businesses, an indicator of a loss in business from rich clients, for the second quarter. Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told journalists on a call that 4.2 billion francs of the outflows were related to its efforts to limit its risk in Asia. ""Operationally, CS has been able to meet expectations on the whole,"" ZKB analysts said in a note, adding the headline profit miss was related largely to legal and restructuring provisions. ""However, net new money is showing signs of slowing down with outflows of 4.7 billion francs,"" the analysts said, referring to the group-wide figure which includes flows for businesses outside wealth management. Earlier this week, Credit Suisse appointed Goldman Sachs REVENUES FALL A 41% fall in investment banking revenues showed the broader impact of the scandals to be slightly more pronounced than analysts anticipated, as its capital markets business posted a nearly 10% decline on an un-adjusted basis and its advisory revenues fell 37% ""due to timing of deal closings"". That combined with the $653 million Archegos hit pushed investment banking to a pre-tax loss. On the trading side, adjusted revenues from equity sales and trading fell 17% decline excluding Archegos. Fixed income sales and trading dropped 33%. Trading revenues also fell at major U.S. and European banks in the second quarter compared to 2020 when unprecedented market volatility during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic helped drive record volumes. Credit Suisse has said it wants to pare back its prime brokerage unit, which conducts business with hedge funds and was responsible for the Archegos ties.

wealth,Latest shift to tech leaves Cathie Wood's ARKK in the cold," NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - A rebound in growth stocks over the last month is doing little to bolster the performance of Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which has lagged this year after outperforming all other U.S. equity funds in 2020. The $22.4 billion ARKK fund ARK Innovation's portfolio rallied amid last year?�s economic lockdown thanks to bets on companies such as Zoom Video Communications Inc This year, by contrast, kicked off with a powerful broad market rotation into value stocks that boosted shares of energy firms, banks and other companies expected to benefit from a vaccine-fueled economic rebound. While worries over slowing growth and a COVID-19 resurgence have partially reversed that shift, investors??recent preference for big tech and growth stalwarts suggests that, for now, few expect a return to the broad economic lockdowns that boosted the companies in Wood?�s portfolio in 2020, said Dave Mazza, managing director at Direxion. ""People are finding comfort in the mega-cap names. While we might have seen peak economic growth there's not a sense that we're going to have a massive contraction in the economy"" from further restrictions on travel or school closures, he said. ARK did not respond to a request to comment for this story. The United States leads the world in the daily average number of new infections, accounting for one in every nine cases reported worldwide each day.

wealth,"Hear no evil, see no evil: How Credit Suisse ignored Archegos warnings"," FRANKFURT, July 29 (Reuters) - Weeks before Archegos collapsed, Credit Suisse ""Try and act soon,"" the risk analyst told a colleague in the department dealing with investment fund Archegos, warning that the fund was vulnerable to liquidation, exposing Credit Suisse. ""If there is an issue, all brokers would be looking to exit simultaneously,"" he cautioned, a prediction that turned into reality less than two months later when the fund unravelled and lumbered Credit Suisse (CS) with a $5.5 billion loss. The episode is one in a series of failures detailed in a report commissioned by the bank that offers an unprecedented glimpse into dysfunctional workings of one of the globe's largest banks to the wealthy. The Swiss bank suffered by far the most of all peers from financing the fund's risky market bets, after its bankers won the upper hand over ""junior"" risk controllers, overriding safety limits and leverage controls, and leaving it unguarded when disaster struck. The report is unusual because its publication represents a rare mea culpa from an institution that closely guards the secrets of its clients. Its criticism is frank, blaming management failure, a focus on maximizing short-term profits and enabling of Archegos?�s ""voracious risk-taking"" for failing to steer the bank away from catastrophe. Despite long-running discussions about Archegos, by far its largest hedge-fund client, Credit Suisse's top management were apparently unaware, with the group's chief risk officer and investment bank chief recalling hearing of it first on the eve of its collapse. ""There were numerous warning signals,"" the report said. ""Yet the business ... failed to heed these signs."" The report examines the bank's relationship, spanning almost two decades, with Bill Hwang, the banker behind Archegos, and his chequered history. Hwang could not immediately be reached for comment. It is part of a wider drive by new chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio to reform the culture of the bank, after a series of previous scandals from spying on executives to its entanglement with doomed supply chain finance specialist Greensill - a key associate of CS whose near coincidental failure represented a disastrous double whammy. BANNED FROM TRADING In 2012, Hwang settled insider trading allegations with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and pleaded guilty to wire fraud with the U.S. Department of Justice, the report said. His fund, Tiger Asia, rebranded as Archegos. Two years later, Hwang and Archegos were banned from trading in Hong Kong, the report noted. Credit Suisse did not cut its ties. Instead, it shifted its trading focus to the United States. The report describes the bank's risk assessments following these episodes, as ""perfunctory"", while its bankers ""shrugged off the settlements, guilty plea, and trading ban as isolated, one-time events"". In the years that followed, Archegos broke many of the safety limits and internal controls set by Credit Suisse. But rather than paring back its backing, bankers ramped up support. Despite generating modest profit - the bank reaped $16 million in revenue in 2020 - Archegos went on to build up a portfolio with Credit Suisse totalling nearly $24 billion. The 165-page report highlights deep-seated structural flaws, where a depleted risk department, with junior staff and outdated technology unable to challenge bankers driving the business. It relays the damning assessment of another of the bank's analysts monitoring Archegos risks, who criticised the New York risk department. ""The team is run by a salesperson learning the role from people ... he did not trust to have a backbone,"" it said, without naming those involved. Despite flashing red lights in the weeks ahead of its collapse, the bank reimbursed $2.4 billion of ""excess margin"" or surplus funds to Archegos, believing it was legally obliged to do so under its financing terms. The crisis came to a head during the week of March 22, when Archegos?�s single largest bet - on ViacomCBS - dropped sharply, and another, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, plummeted 20%. Archegos admitted to Credit Suisse that it had run short of liquidity. That evening, the bank's investment bank chief and group risk officer, both of whom have since left, were informed. Neither could be reached for comment. ""No one at CS ... appeared to fully appreciate the serious risks,"" the report said. ""These risks were not hidden. They were in plain sight. When CS finally took steps ... the actions ... (were) too little, and too late.""

wealth,China health stocks slammed as investors fear regulators' diagnosis," SHANGHAI, July 28 (Reuters) - Investors have rushed to exit bets on China's health sector this week, fearingthat a regulatory crackdown that sparked panic selling in the tech and education sectors might hit the medical industry next. Medical expenses are one of three key areas of living costs seen as Beijing's targets for social change, heightening expectations that authorities will make healthcare their next focus of market reform. ""Real estate, education, and healthcare are the three big mountains and the government inevitably has to tackle the issues,"" said Ming Liao, founding partner of Beijing-based private equity firm Prospect Avenue Capital. Selling has been fierce and although the Hang Seng healthcare index Among mainland China stocks, the CSI300 Healthcare index ""I think obviously (small investors) have panicked,"" said Andy Maynard, head of equities at China Renaissance in Hong Kong, who feels the rout may have been a bit overdone. Among the worst hit stocks are those with a tech overlap: JD Health International China's health sector is vast, comprising defensive service providers, pharmaceuticals and fast-growing tech and biotech firms, though it had been seen as exposed to big demographic trends and supported by rising public and private spending. Reforms over the past decade have sought to expand social health insurance, public procurement of medicine and hospital building. Last month, China's State Council, or cabinet, promised further progress on medicine prices. Huang Yan, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management, said the government would likely take a targeted approach to tackling different parts of the sector in its drive for social reform. ""Sectors like cosmetic medicine consume wealth but create little social value,"" he said. ""But the government will continue to support innovative drugmaking, while reducing drug prices through bulk-buying."" Still, while costs remain high and quality of care has been an issue outside big cities, analysts are nervous about where the authorities' next move lands. ""The jittery...search for the next shoe to drop may keep investors away from engaging for now,"" said Tommy Xie, OCBC Bank's head of greater China research.

wealth,China urges insurers to increase offerings for natural disaster coverage," BEIJING, July 28 (Reuters) - China's banking and insurance regulator said on Thursday that it will guide insurers to increase investment in natural disaster insurance and enrich product offerings.

At least 73 people have died in China's flood-stricken central province of Henan, official data showed, leaving rail and road links disrupted, goods ranging from cars and electronics damaged, thousands of livestock killed. Chinese insurers have received a total 376,200 claims relating to the Henan floods as of July 26, the CBIRC said, and the total payouts so far reached 492 million yuan. ""Natural disaster risks such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods affected people the most, and it's our people who bear the most direct losses,"" the CBIRC said.

wealth,Five metrics bond investors are watching as COVID fears return," NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - A wild week in Treasuries has investors parsing the cross-currents that may sway prices for U.S. government bonds in coming weeks, including the Federal Reserve, economic data and investor positioning. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury, which moves inversely to bond prices, recently stood at 1.28% on Friday, after falling as low as 1.128% earlier in the week, nearly 65 basis points below its 2021 high on worries over slowing growth and spreading COVID-19 infections. Flows into the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF One of the key questions now hanging over markets is whether Treasury yields will continue moving toward 1% - revisiting the levels they touched during the pandemic - or rebound toward 2%, a level many participants expected to see by year-end. Here are some indicators investors are watching to determine the course of the Treasury market.  TAPERING TALK The Federal Reserve surprised many market participants with a hawkish shift at its June policy meeting, with its so-called dot-plot showing some officials moving up expectations of their first rate hikes to 2023. With the Fed?�s policy meeting concluding on July 28 and the central bank?�s annual symposium at Jackson Hole scheduled for late August, investors will be watching for signs that officials are backpedaling on assurances that the current bout of inflation is transitory, a message that could rattle markets. Investors will also be looking for signals on whether officials believe the Delta variant of COVID-19 may pressure growth, potentially delaying the unwinding of the Fed?�s easy-money policies and depressing yields.  YIELD SPREADS While Treasury yields have slid, the spread between Treasuries and high-yield bonds has remained steady. That suggests that some investors remain bullish on the economy overall, while short-term factors such as positioning and supply are driving the rally in Treasuries, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, in a report.  SHORT INTEREST Leveraged funds - including hedge funds - have piled into bearish bets on U.S. Treasuries as part of the so-called reflation trade, which saw investors position for lower yields and buy shares of companies that could benefit from a powerful rebound in growth. L1N2OX2MM While net speculative bets on 10-year Treasury  futures flipped into bullish territory for the week ended July 13, those on other maturities, including 30-years, remained bearish, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. A reversal in that positioning could fuel Treasury gains and drag yields lower.  ECONOMIC DATA While the economy continues to rebound from last year?�s swoon, worries that the pace of growth is slowing contributed to the rally in Treasuries earlier this week. Citigroup?�s U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which measures the degree to which the data is beating or missing economists??forecasts, stands at 11.6, compared with its record high of 270.8 touched in 2020. Praveen Koropaty, U.S. interest rate strategist at Goldman Sachs, believes the Fed will want to see the employment reports from July, August and September before committing to an unwinding of its easy money policies. At some point in November or December, ?�the Fed will announce a taper and I don't think the market will freak out as it will be well telegraphed,??he said.  BREAKEVEN INFLATION RATES Breakeven rates - the spread in the yield between a Treasury note and a Treasury Inflation Protected Security of the same duration - are narrowing, a sign that investors are showing more faith in the Federal Reserve's estimate that high inflation will be transitory, wrote Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler. ""The rout in commodity markets and pullback in reflation momentum is giving the Fed?�s forecast additional credibility,"" he said.

wealth,"Investors eye COVID-19 spread, Golden Cross to gauge U.S. dollar trajectory"," July 23 (Reuters) - A rally in the U.S. dollar has investors looking at a broad range of factors -- from global COVID-19 infections to yield gaps -- to determine whether the greenback will continue appreciating. The dollar is up 4% from its lows of 2021 and is among the world's best performing currencies this year, boosted by last month's hawkish shift from the Federal Reserve, burgeoning inflation and safe-haven demand driven by COVID-19 worries. Because of the dollar?�s central role in the global financial system, its moves ripple out towards a broad range of asset classes and are closely watched by investors. For the United States, a period of sustained dollar strength would be a double-edged sword, helping tamp down inflation by increasing the currency's buying power while denting the balance sheets of exporters by making their products less competitive abroad. On the other hand, dollar strength would continue pushing down currencies such as the euro and British pound, potentially giving a boost to the recoveries in those countries. Here are several things investors are watching to determine the dollar's trajectory. THE DELTA VARIANT Some investors believe the dollar - a popular safe haven during uncertain times - will rise if the Delta variant of COVID-19 spreads and risk aversion grows in markets. COVID worries have already helped the dollar notch gains against the currencies of countries where the Delta variant is proliferating, including the Australian dollar and the British pound. Those gains could fade if coronavirus concerns ebb in coming months, however. ""We're seeing a lot of risk factors and uncertainty across assets, said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe. ""Investors are looking at all these and saying that they're going to find refuge in the dollar."" GLOBAL GROWTH While some investors are concerned the U.S. rebound is slowing, it still outpaces the bounce seen in Europe and other regions. That gap in growth, illustrated by such metrics as stronger manufacturing sector growth and inflation, is among the factors putting upward pressure on the dollar, said Morgan Stanley?�s James Lord in a recent podcast. ""There is a case still for the dollar to strengthen as we do see more divergence,"" he said. YIELD GAP Though Treasury yields have recently slid, the gap between real yields on U.S. government debt and some foreign bonds has widened, raising the allure of dollar-denominated assets. Real yields represent the cost of borrowing after stripping out inflation effects. The spread between the real yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities at ""constant maturity"" and those on their German counterpart, for instance, stood at 72 basis points late Thursday, up from 63 basis points two months ago. POSITIONING SQUEEZE Speculators' net short positions on the U.S. dollar fell to their lowest level since March 2020 last week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on July 16. ""The most crowded trade in the world through the first quarter was the short dollar. We had, unquestionably, a squeeze on the way back,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. The dwindling bearish sentiment could mean there is less fuel for further dollar gains. At the same time, ""the dollar and other currencies do tend to overshoot when they are correcting, in both directions,"" Schamotta said. GOLDEN CROSS The Dollar Index's A Golden Cross ""could herald another leg higher for the greenback,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.

wealth,Veteran manager Sullivan to lead Wells Fargo's divested asset management arm," July 26 (Reuters) - Private equity firms GTCR LLC and Reverence Capital Partners said on Monday financial industry veteran Joseph Sullivan will head Wells Fargo Asset Management, the business they agreed to acquire earlier this year from Wells Fargo Sullivan, who was previously the chief executive officer of asset manager Legg Mason Inc, will take the helm after the deal closes in the second half of this year. Current CEO Nico Marais will retire and become a senior adviser, the companies said.

wealth,Bond buying flows surge as funds reverse reflation bets - BofA," LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Global fund investors ploughed the most money into high quality bonds in nearly 5 months over the last week BofA analysts estimated on Friday, amid the ongoing unwind of the global reflation trade. BofA's number crunchers who analyse weekly investment flow figures from EPFR said funds had bought $8.4 billion worth of bonds overall including $2.6 billion of U.S. government bonds. The figures cover the week up to Wednesday and therefore the powerful rally in bond markets on Monday when the resurgence in global COVID cases seemed to suddenly ignite fears about the likelihood of economies being able to return to normal. There had also been the largest withdrawal from U.S. stocks in 6 weeks at $2.6 billion and the largest outflow from European stocks and gold since March at $700 million and $1 billion respectively. It hasn't been all gloom though. BofA estimated that funds have pumped $3.3 billion into stocks worldwide, although the fact $1.6 billion went into tech and $1.5 billion went into healthcare stocks again highlights the virus' impact.

wealth,Britain unveils plan to return NatWest to majority private control," LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - Britain's government on Thursday unveiled a blueprint for returning NatWest The finance ministry said it had instructed Morgan Stanley to sell NatWest shares on its behalf in a scheme starting on Aug. 12 and running until Aug. 11, 2022. NatWest shares have rallied 23% since the start of the year, supported by the recovery from the pandemic. But they are still far below the 502-pence level of the 2008 taxpayer rescue, making further substantial losses on the bailout likely. At 1120 GMT, NatWest shares were trading at 196.80 pence, down 1% from the previous day's close. The British state currently owns around 54.7% of NatWest after spending 45 billion pounds ($61.87 billion) bailing out the lender 13 years ago. The government said it planned to sell up to 15% of the total volume of NatWest shares being traded on the market over the duration of the plan. That would roughly equate to around 2 billion pounds, or 8.8% of shares, based on the last three month of trading volume, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated in a note. Morgan Stanley will only sell shares at or above a price per share that the government has determined ""delivers value for money for the taxpayer"". ""This move will be welcomed by investors and should improve liquidity in the stock as well as reinforcing the government's desire to reduce/exit its shareholding, even if the plan weighs on the share price over the next 12 months,"" said Ronan Dunphy, banking analyst at Goodbody. ""If the market is judged to be able to digest the sell down without an uncomfortable price reaction, we wouldn't be surprised to see (the government) seek to reduce its shareholding further."" NatWest CEO Alison Rose welcomed the government's plan and said it showed the bank was on a better footing. The plan to sell shares on the open market also opens the door to NatWest buying back up to 10% of its shares. Details of the share sale come after the government sold 1.1 billion pounds worth of NatWest shares through a one-off stock offering in May. NatWest also bought a similar chunk of stock directly from the government in March, but is prevented from launching another directed buyback for 12 months under company rules restricting it to buying around 5% of its stock through this route. The government said it may also sell NatWest shares through other means such as accelerated bookbuilds or directing share buybacks.

wealth,Analysis: Investors look to near $2 trillion corporate cash hoard to buoy stocks," NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Investors are looking to a mounting pile of cash at U.S. companies to provide support for the stock market in coming months, as executives announce plans to increase share buybacks, boost dividends or pour money back into their businesses. Cash on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies has swelled to a record $1.9 trillion, compared to $1.5 trillion before the pandemic crisis in early 2020, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. The cash hoard likely will be a key factor in investors??calculus as second-quarter earnings season hits full swing while market participants gauge how equities respond to worries over slowing growth and a COVID-19 resurgence that sparked a rush to safe-haven Treasuries in recent days. High corporate cash balances are ?�a nice, subtle form of market support,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive officer at  Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ?�With all the talk about markets getting ahead of themselves and aggressive valuations, this provides market support into 2022 and 2023.??Large amounts of cash give companies flexibility to take potentially share-supportive measures, including facilitating buybacks, which boost earnings per share. Companies may also raise dividends, making their stocks more attractive to income-seeking investors amid falling Treasury yields. A stock basket created by Goldman Sachs of companies returning a comparatively large amount of cash to shareholders through buybacks or dividends had outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021 by 5% as of last Thursday. A separate basket of companies with relatively high capital spending or research and development expenses outperformed by 2%. ""Investors have rewarded all uses of cash recently,"" Goldman said in a report last week. The investment bank's strategists projected buybacks will increase by 35% this year. The focus on cash comes as investors try to read conflicting market signals that have emerged over the last few weeks. Though stocks stand near records, Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, fell to their lowest level since February this week amid concerns the Delta variant of COVID-19 could hamper the economic recovery. Expectations of big corporate spending could encourage investors to buy future stock dips, softening declines that some say are overdue. The S&P 500 has averaged three pullbacks of at least 5% a year since 1950, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, but has yet to log such a drop in 2021. RISING BUYBACKS U.S. companies have announced $350 billion in buybacks in the second quarter, the largest since the second quarter of 2018, after announcing $275 billion in the first quarter, according to EPFR. Total S&P 500 dividend payouts rose 3.6% to $123.4 billion in the second quarter from the year-ago period, although that amount trailed record payouts in the first quarter of 2020, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Investors will get further insight into spending plans as more results arrive, including reports from Apple Technology and financials announced the largest amount of buybacks among sectors so far this year, JP Morgan said in a note this week. Apple alone in April raised its share repurchase authorization by $90 billion. Dealmaking is another way companies could deploy their resources, with Goldman projecting S&P 500 cash spending on mergers and acquisitions will jump by 45% to $324 billion this year. ?�A lot of these mega-cap companies are generating so much cash that they can make sizable acquisitions,"" said Charlie Ryan, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. ?�There is a competitive advantage to having that scale, having that cash on the balance sheet.??Our Standards: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters."
wealth,Analysis: SPAC u-turn mars Ackman's hedge fund pivot," July 20 (Reuters) - It was poised to be William Ackman's brilliant pivot from activist hedge fund manager to prominent dealmaker. It ended up souring his rebranding. Ackman last year launched a $4 billion special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the largest blank-check acquisition firm ever raised. With backing from his investors and available bank debt, he amassed enough firepower to take public a company worth tens of billions of dollars. Last month, however, Ackman unveiled plans to buy a 10% stake in Universal Music Group, which its owner Vivendi SA Shareholders of his SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd Ackman's financial engineering proved too much for Tontine investors and U.S. regulators. Tontine shares dropped 18% in the weeks after the deal was announced. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pushed back on the deal by arguing it would not comply with New York Stock Exchange rules, Ackman said. By Monday, Ackman He will now replace Tontine in the deal with his hedge fund vehicles and will seek co-investments from other outside investors to pull off a transaction he made over a handshake with French businessman Vincent Bollore last month. Sources familiar with his thinking said he expects the investments in the new co-investment vehicle to be oversubscribed. But three long-standing Pershing Square investors said they were skeptical pension funds, family offices and sovereign wealth funds would step up. They spoke on condition of anonymity because of agreements they have signed with Pershing Square. When Ackman offered his previous co-investment vehicles to investors in companies such as Automatic Data Processing Inc and Air Products and Chemicals, the allure was the potential pop in the stock once Ackman's position became public. This will not be the case now as the deal valuing Universal Music Group at $35 billion is already known, and, some of Ackman's critics argue, overpriced. ""He's pulled a switcheroo by announcing an investment in a company instead of a merger to take a company public any many investors didn't like it,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan said about the Universal Music deal. Ackman declined to comment. Ackman is obligated to invest $2 billion and can invest as much as $4 billion in Universal Music Group, which has the rights to artists ranging from Taylor Swift to Drake. Potential investors have not yet seen terms for what would be Pershing Square's seventh co-investment vehicle. REBUILDING RETURNS The last few years set records at New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management, with Ackman posting returns of 70.2% return in 2020 and a 58.1% return in 2019. The successes followed double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 and smaller declines in 2017 and 2018. Turning his back on stumbles in Valeant and Herbalife, Ackman adopted a back-to-basics theme by ending investor visits that were eating into his time and hunkering down in the office to do research. Two years ago, Ackman told clients his hedge fund would transform itself into a holding company that owns stakes in public companies and offers a helping hand to struggling management teams to resurrect once-strong returns. This year Pershing Square Holdings has returned 6.5% while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has gained roughly 15%. ""Some investors will stay loyal to Ackman, of course, because they have seen him goof up before and then buckle down and win again,"" University of Michigan's Gordon said.

wealth,"Bubbles, bubbles everywhere: Jeremy Grantham on the bust ahead"," NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - In this manic era of meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and real-estate bidding wars, studying the history of financial markets might seem a little dry and old-fashioned. Except to Jeremy Grantham. The chairman of the board of famed asset managers GMO is a certified bubble-ologist, fascinated by how and why bubbles emerge. Grantham studies classic ones like 1929, but - now in his eighties - he has also lived through (and called) numerous modern booms and busts, including the dot-com wreckage in 2000, the bull market peak in 2008 and the bear market low in 2009. In case you did not know where this is headed: He says we are in a bubble right now. In January Grantham wrote an investor letter, ""Waiting For the Last Dance,"" about an inflating bubble that ""could well be the most important event of your investing lives."" Six months later, the stock market is starting to show some cracks. Grantham spoke with Reuters about this moment of market history. Q: When your letter of warning came out, what was the response like? A: I got a lot of pushback. Waves of Bitcoin freaks attacked me in every way possible. They said my ears were too big, and that I needed to be locked up in an old-folks home. Q: So if we were already in a bubble then, where do things stand right now? A: Bubbles are unbelievably easy to see; it's knowing when the bust will come that is trickier. You see it when the markets are on the front pages instead of the financial pages, when the news is full of stories of people getting cheated, when new coins are being created every month. The scale of these things is so much bigger than in 1929 or in 2000. Q: What is your take on equity valuations now? A: Looking at most measures, the market is more expensive than in 2000, which was more expensive than anything that preceded it. My favorite metric is price-to-sales: What you find is that even the cheapest parts of the market are way more expensive than in 2000. Q: What might bring an end to this bubble? A: Markets peak when you are as happy as you can get, and a near-perfect economy is extrapolated into the indefinite future. But around the corner are lurking serious issues like interest rates, inflation, labor and commodity prices. All of those are beginning to look less optimistic than they did just a week or two ago. Q: How long until a bust? A: A bust might take a few more months, and, in fact, I hope it does, because it will give us the opportunity to warn more people. The probabilities are that this will go into the fall: The stimulus, the economic recovery, and vaccinations have all allowed this thing to go on a few months longer than I would have initially guessed. What pricks the bubble could be a virus problem, it could be an inflation problem, or it could be the most important category of all, which is everything else that is unexpected. One of 20 different things that you haven't even thought of will come out of the woodwork, and you had no idea it was even there. Q: What might a bust look like? A: There will be an enormous negative wealth effect, broader than it has ever been, compared to any other previous bubble breaking. It's the first time we have bubbled in so many different areas ??interest rates, stocks, housing, non-energy commodities. On the way up, it gave us all a positive wealth effect, and on the way down it will retract, painfully. Q: Are there any asset classes which are relatively attractive? A: You could always own cash, or you could do what the institutions do, which is buy heavily into the asset classes that are least bad. The least overpriced are value stocks and emerging markets. Those are the two arbitrages. With value and emerging, you should make some positive return over the next 10 years. Q: It is difficult to be bearish right now? A: Not for me, because I don't have career risk anymore. But every big company has lots of risk: They facilitate a bubble until it bursts, and then they change their tune as fast as they can, and make money on the downside. But this bubble is the real thing, and everyone can see it. It's as obvious as the nose on your face.

wealth,How to stop food costs from eating up your budget," NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - If you have a sneaking suspicion that your food bills have been going up and up, you are not crazy. In fact you are probably absolutely right. Just ask Hollie Pollard. The freelance virtual assistant from Toronto has been astonished every time she walks into the grocery store. ?�I went to get a steak last week, because it?�s grilling season and I wanted to do a nice BBQ,??said the 57-year-old. ?�Then I realized it was almost 50% more than what I was paying last year."" Pollard bought chicken instead. All told, Pollard estimates her grocery bills have gone up by around a quarter since the start of the pandemic. Indeed, food prices keep edging higher. In the United States, for example, food costs (including both at home, and away from home) are up 2.4% in the last 12 months, according to June numbers from the Consumer Price Index. Break it down into categories, and some of the year-over-year unadjusted numbers are pretty eye-popping. Bacon: up 8.4%. Milk: 5.6%. Fresh fruit: 7.3%. Lettuce: 5.1%. Fresh fish: 6.4%. GOBBLING UP BUDGETS Given our extraordinary more than 15 months of pandemic, it is not surprising that food prices have been affected. Supply chains around the world are disrupted, and workforces are in turmoil because of the ongoing global pandemic, which has affected prices on store shelves and in restaurants. That means people need to rework their monthly budgets. When Personal Capital, a popular investment website and app, surveyed professionals on their top spending categories, the single area that got the most mentions: groceries. That was true of every demographic, from millennials to Gen Xers to boomers. An analysis of user data by Personal Capital shows that groceries accounted for up to 15% of individuals??monthly spend during the height of the pandemic, compared with only 7% pre-pandemic, according to Craig Birk, Personal Capital's chief investment officer. When Personal Capital asked people where they tend to overspend, the No. 1 category was dining out, at 39.1%. No. 2: Groceries, at 32.2%. Of course, there are a few ways to minimize the food-cost damage, but you have to be thoughtful and deliberate about it. Here are some ideas: PLAN AHEAD The more times you visit the grocery store, the more chances for you to impulse buy and get whatever catches your eye. That is why Hollie Pollard does the work of planning her meals a couple of weeks in advance. She makes only a couple of major shopping trips per month ??and bulk buying helps reduce her overall bills. MAXIMIZE YOUR REWARDS If you have to pay more for food, at the very least you can boost the rewards you get for doing so. ?�You?�re missing out on savings if you?�re not paying with the right credit card,??says Trae Bodge, a smart shopping expert and founder of the site TrueTrae.com.

wealth,"AMC shares attempt a comeback, GameStop falls"," July 15 (Reuters) - Shares of retail favorite AMC Entertainment were fighting to reverse a recent string of losses Thursday, as Wall Street debated the longevity of a trading frenzy in stocks that gained a massive following on social media in 2020. AMC shares were recently up 1.7% at $33.99 after four straight days of losses. The hugely volatile stock has lost more than half its value since hitting a record high of $76.62 on June 2. On Thursday, the stock swung between a low of $32.14 and a high of $37.40. Shares of videogame retailer GameStop, meanwhile, continued their recent tumble and were off 3.1% at $162.34, compared with its June peak of $344.66. Netflix Cinema operator AMC and GameStop have been at the center of massive rallies in meme stocks that hurt bearish hedge funds and raised the profile of retail investors coordinating their buying on websites such as Reddit?�s WallStreetBets. While both are sitting on big year-to-date-gains - AMC is up about 1500% in 2021 and GameStop is up around 760% - their more recent slides have led some analysts to question whether the retail fervor that buoyed their shares is dying down. Retail investor purchases of meme stocks tracked by Vanda Research have declined steeply since early June, roughly mirroring the fall in the basket of meme stocks followed by the firm. ?�Retail investors are slowly capitulating on meme stocks, and prices are tumbling as a result,??Vanda?�s analysts said in a recent note. Meanwhile, Google searches for ?�invest??and ?�buy stocks??have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, in what DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said is an ominous sign for the meme stock rally.

wealth,"Pimco sees global growth moderating in 2022, sustainable issues playing a role"," July 14 (Reuters) - Global growth will moderate next year but remain at a strong  pace, bond manager Pimco said on Wednesday, with a trend toward sustainable investing creating risks and opportunities in some sectors. Pimco portfolio managers Erin Browne and Geraldine Sundstrom made the forecast in an asset-allocation report sent by a spokeswoman. The managers wrote they expect real gross domestic product in developed markets to grow 6% this year as economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and moderate to 3% in 2022. ""Pent-up demand, high levels of consumer saving, and healthy corporate leverage ratios create a runway for private-sector-led growth,"" they wrote, a background that should make growth-oriented assets attractive. Slower vaccination rates in emerging markets have delayed their recovery, the report said, setting their GDP to grow at 3.5% this year and accelerate to 5% in 2022. With the global economic expansion at mid-cycle, they wrote, a factor that could be different than previous recoveries is the growth of investment strategies and business practices focused on environmental, social and governance issues. The trend should boost demand for sectors like renewable energy, semiconductors and forestry products, but could mean risky transitions for traditional oil and gas companies, Pimco wrote. Attempts to address inequality like higher minimum wages and better working conditions ""will inevitably have trickle-down effects on smaller businesses,"" the authors wrote. They also said that broader redistribution of income ""could also mean more economy-wide consumption and less propensity to save.""

wealth,BlackRock profit beats as assets grow to a record $9.5 trillion," NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BlackRock's assets under management jumped to a record $9.49 trillion in the second quarter from $7.32 trillion a year earlier. ""More than ever, our voice is resonating deeper and more broadly with our clients worldwide,"" BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, said in an interview. The company continued to gather assets at a robust pace as investors deployed money across BlackRock's product types and asset classes. Global equity markets' strength during the second quarter helped boost both assets under management as well as fee growth. The U.S. economy displayed signs of a recovery over the past quarter, helped by large government stimulus and steady vaccination programs. Global financial markets continue to display strength a year after the coronavirus pandemic crashed asset prices and hurt risk sentiment. ""It seems like everything is going their way right now. It's just strength across the entire platform,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.  Despite the better-than-expected results, BlackRock shares fell 3.3% to $877.98, a near 1-week low. Investors may have been disappointed in net inflows coming in at $81 billion, down from $172 billion in the prior quarter, a drop associated with the loss of a $58 billion equity index mandate from a U.S. pension fund client, analysts said. ""People are also focused on where the growth is coming, and the growth is coming in the ETF business, which tends to generate a lower revenue base than the traditional long only asset management business,"" said CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert. A combination of these factors may have spooked investors, Seifert, who still likes the stock and would treat Wednesday's weakness as a buying opportunity, said. BlackRock remains well placed to be a leader in the asset management industry, analysts said. ""Despite them having $9.5 trillion and being so big, they are still best positioned to deliver the best growth over the next couple of years, relative to their peers,"" Sanders said. The company's adjusted net income rose to $1.55 billion, or $10.03 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $1.21 billion, or $7.85 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $9.46 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 32% to $4.82 billion, helped by higher performance fees and 14% growth in revenue from technology services.

wealth,Bank of America focuses on loan growth as rate hikes fade into the distance," July 14 - Bank of America Corp Its stock was down 5% in midday trading. Analysts view Bank of America as the most exposed to rates among large U.S. banks. Management has shifted strategies multiple times to perform better, but rate changes have been nearly impossible to predict for more than a decade, as policymakers have responded to various crises since 2008, including the coronavirus pandemic that began last year. Although Bank of America?�s net income soared 173% to nearly $9 billion in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period, beating analyst estimates, its net interest income fell more than 6%. Management offered a forecast of brighter earnings if loan demand picks up or interest rates rise in a neat way. Analysts were skeptical that will happen in the near term. ""BofA really needs rates to move up,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio focused on positive trends during calls with journalists and analysts. Loan demand has started to turn upward, which will help Bank of America earn more money from deposits, they said. Statistics from Bank of America customers??credit cards and bank accounts show that consumers are spending more, they added. Donofrio touted Bank of America?�s ability to keep net interest income relatively steady, even as rates plummeted and loan demand cratered during the pandemic. The bank is betting on loan growth to get where it needs to be, rather than trying to invest with a view on rate directions, he said. ""We're not traders or a hedge fund,??said Donofrio. ?�We are deploying our excess liquidity in a prudent way over time and we are always balancing our need to have liquidity."" For now, Bank of America?�s average loan book was up 0.02% during the second quarter compared with the prior period, and down 12% from the year-ago period. Its deposits were up 14% to $1.9 trillion. In its investment portfolio, Bank of America nearly doubled debt securities on its balance sheet from June 2020 to June 2021, to $940 billion from $472 billion, according to its financial statements. The fair value of its Treasury securities and U.S. agency-backed bonds tripled during that time. Bank of America?�s holdings of Treasury bonds and debt issued by U.S. agencies more than tripled. The bank added exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) it underwrites that have high credit ratings, rather than distributing all the pieces to investors, Donofrio said. Those securities tend to have higher returns than Treasury bonds and other low-risk assets. Overall, the bank produced $8.96 billion, or $1.03 per share, in quarterly profit, up from $3.28 billion, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 77 cents per share, on average, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Net revenue dropped 4% to $21.5 billion. Net interest income fell 6% to $10.2 billion from $10.8 billion. That metric shows the difference between what banks charge for loans and pay for funding. The Federal Reserve has begun discussions on tapering easy-money policies, with policymakers bringing forward their forecasts for raising interest rates to 2023 from 2024. However, in prepared testimony for a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that such moves will not happen any time soon.

wealth,EXCLUSIVE Wealth manager Americana Partners bid $25 a share for Westwood Holdings Group," BOSTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Wealth manager Americana Partners has made a $25 a share bid for Westwood Holdings Group Westwood said in a statement it had reviewed two bids from Americana, including the one for $25 per share, and are rejecting both. The bids are too low and executives are not certain that Americana would be able to finance the transaction, it said. Houston-based Americana made the all-cash offer for Westwood, which is based in Dallas and has roughly $15 billion in assets under management, last month, the sources said. News of the unsolicited bid sent Westwood's stock up as much as 19% on Wednesday, leaving it to trade at $23.30 by early afternoon. A representative for Americana declined to comment. Including Wednesday's jump, Westwood's stock price has climbed some 63% since January. But Americana believes that Westwood has produced negative returns over three- and five-year periods. Americana also believes Westwood could perform better out of the spotlight of the public markets, the people said. Americana wants to expand across Texas and sees potential in Westwood's wealth and trust businesses, the sources said. The bid was made shortly after Westwood's largest investor, James C. Pappas' JCP Investment Management, which owns 10.37% of Westwood, began pushing management and the board more publicly to consider alternatives for the firm, including a sale. In a regulatory filing in April, Pappas said that he intended to speak with management and the board about strategic options. A representative for JCP declined to comment. Westwood chief executive officer Brian Casey said on Wednesday that cost cuts and investments in technology are paying off, however. ""Westwood is now on a more clear path to growth,"" Casey said in the statement. ""We are even more confident in our ability to carry out our current plan."" A wave of consolidation has hit the asset management and wealth management industry at a time when low interest rates and investor preferences for inexpensive index funds have made it tougher for stand-alone firms to compete with rivals such as BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager. Legg Mason was acquired by Franklin Resources last year and Eaton Vance was purchased by financial services company Morgan Stanley this year. Last year was record-setting for wealth sector deals, with more than 200 completed, according to research firm Echelon Partners.

wealth,EXCLUSIVE U.S. SEC focuses on bank fee conflicts as it steps-up SPAC inquiry -sources," WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has ramped-up its inquiry on Wall Street's blank check acquisition frenzy, homing in on potential conflicts of interest created when banks act as underwriters and advisers on the same deal, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring whether certain fee structures may incentivise underwriters on special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, listings to secure unsuitable deals when also advising on the later stage merger, potentially putting investors at risk, the people said. Banks that have received SEC requests for information include top SPAC underwriters Citigroup Spokespeople for the banks declined to comment. SPACs are listed shell companies used to take private companies public, sidestepping the more traditional and Reuters reported in March that the SEC's enforcement division had opened an inquiry on Wall Street banks' SPAC dealings, sending letters to several institutions seeking information on deal risks and internal controls. Since March, the SEC has focused its inquiry on a group of banks, law firms and SPAC sponsors involved in troubled deals and has sought more information about the deals and interviewed executives concerned, according to two of the three sources. The SEC is particularly interested in the fees banks have earned when playing several roles on a deal, all three sources said. They declined to say which deals were under scrutiny. ""The big issue for the SEC is to understand if the advisers are conflicted,"" said one of the people. A spokesperson for the SEC did not respond to requests for comment. SPAC sponsors typically pay banks a 5.5% fee for underwriting the IPO, part of which is paid up front, with the rest paid upon completion of the merger. Underwriting banks can earn more fees if they also go on to represent the merger target and help the SPAC sponsor raise additional cash from private investors to finance the takeover. The SEC is examining potential conflicts in such situations when a bank works for both sides of the transaction and stands to earn a chunk of fees when the merger goes through. Critics say such arrangements could incentivise banks to talk up targets or play down potential problems, which could harm investors if the target company's earnings underperform, or other regulatory or legal issues emerge following the merger. SPAC returns have trailed the S&P 500 The sources declined to be named because the discussions are private. Regulatory requests for information do not necessarily imply wrongdoing. EXTRA DILIGENCE Under the rules, lawyers and accountants are required to disclose their fees in the SPAC's regulatory filings, but banks are not. In its recent inquiries, the SEC has asked banks for more information on their payouts, the three sources said. The SEC has also asked the banks for information on the due diligence they performed on SPAC mergers, including when reviewing revenue growth projections and other disclosures made by the target companies, one of the sources said. The increased scrutiny has prompted some banks to review their processes and increase due diligence, the third source said, adding that some banks and sponsors were also more frequently separating the underwriting and advisory roles. SPACs have existed for decades, but over the past 18 months the deal structure has been popularized by high-profile sponsors and boosted by easy monetary conditions. A record nearly $100 billion was raised by U.S. SPACs in the first quarter of 2021, according to Dealogic, before dealmaking flagged amid market saturation and (This story corrects RICs for Citi, Credit Suisse) Our Standards: U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Wednesday ahead of quarterly results from JPMorgan which will kick off the corporate earnings season, with investors awaiting inflation data for clues on the future path of monetary policy."
wealth,Analysis: Digital rivals? Central bank e-cash plans prompt lenders to wade in," LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - As central banks dabble with digital currencies, commercial lenders are ramping up efforts to influence policy and technical plans, according to more than half a dozen industry executives and public filings. Worried that the explosion in cryptocurrencies could weaken their grasp on the economy, monetary policymakers from Washington to Beijing are exploring issuing their own central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. Although a widely used digital dollar, euro or yuan may still be years away, such projects threaten to disrupt the financial services industry - galvanizing banks into action. ""CBDCs start a debate on the very essence of money that could have a big impact in almost everything we do, from securities processing to settlement,"" said Swen Werner, managing director for digital assets at State Street Depending on the design, CBDCs might see central banks and tech players compete in the retail banking space while giving incumbents opportunities to cut costs and improve services. Unlike cryptocurrencies which are typically run by private actors, or the electronic money used in billions of transactions daily that is mostly created by commercial banks, some CBDCs would be equivalent to cash, issued and backed by central banks. State Street, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Lenders are funding research, teaming up with tech companies and central banks on pilot projects, and stepping up lobbying, according to executives and public records. They are also working on the issue through trade groups like the European Banking Federation (EBF) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and via private talks with policymakers. The implications of CBDCs are ""concerning"", the EBF said in an email, adding: ""Given the potentially far-reaching impact of the digital euro, the EBF is keen to see a more structured dialogue with the European Central Bank and the European banks to work closely together on this project."" WHOLESALE OPPORTUNITIES CBDCs could take one of two basic forms, wholesale or retail. Wholesale digital coins could be used to make payments between banks or other entities with central bank accounts, using distributed ledger technology to make the process simpler and cheaper. HSBC and Standard Chartered are already working with central banks in Hong Kong, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates to use CBDCs for wholesale cross-border payments, currently a lengthy process involving multiple intermediaries. Citi and JPMorgan are among banks involved in a similar effort in Singapore. Ultimately, such projects could allow companies to safely make payments across jurisdictions in real time. HSBC CEO Noel Quinn told Reuters in May that CBDCs could simplify global payments, cut costs and boost transparency. HSBC is talking to governments including Britain, China and Canada about their digital cash initiatives, he said. CBDCs could also make settling securities trades - which can take days, with several parties involved - more efficient, said executives. A CBDC could be programmed with instructions to deliver the security instantly upon receipt of the digital cash. London-based Fnality, a startup backed by 15 financial firms, is awaiting regulatory approval for a blockchain-based system that would streamline settlement between financial institutions. And in a first, Goldman Sachs said last month it had settled a repo trade on JPMorgan's private blockchain network. RETAIL WORRIES Incumbents are concerned, though, about a prospective retail CBDC, with digital coins issued directly to consumers. Advocates say that could allow millions of people shut out of the financial system to receive, spend and save money via a digital wallet. Retail CBDCs could improve government services and reduce fraud. Pandemic aid, for example, could have been issued faster and more cheaply as a retail CBDC useable only for eligible expenditures. But such a model risks cannibalizing banks' deposit bases, a key source of cheap funding, and related fees. Morgan Stanley said last month a digital euro could suck up 8% of euro zone banks' customer deposits. The Bank of England has also warned that a major shift to digital currencies, including CBDCs, would push up funding costs and raise the interest rates banks charge. ""If central banks position themselves in competition on the money people can hold, it could mean less deposits with commercial banks,"" said Isabelle Martz, deputy director of retail payments at Societe Generale. ""It could have an impact on the ability to finance the economy."" The EBF has urged central banks to avoid CBDCs that would compete with deposits by serving as savings and investment instruments. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also warned against crowding out private sector innovation. But that scenario is seen as extreme, and central bankers have said they want to preserve the role of commercial banks. ""People recognize the involvement of the private sector is key,"" said Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs. Policymakers could still expand the types of private companies allowed to issue retail CBDCs, intensifying competition. China, for example, has allowed fintech giant Ant Group to join its CBDC trial. Some industry groups are pushing for non-bank entrants to face the same regulatory scrutiny as banks, and for the private sector to have more say in policy discussions. The U.S. Chamber, for example, is advocating for the White House to create a taskforce that includes the government, private sector and academics to help shape U.S. CBDC strategy. ""We are in various discussions to help to put some ideas on the table and to advocate with Members of Congress and the regulatory agencies to get them to come together and come up with the right policies,"" said the Chamber's Tom Quaadman.

wealth,Goldman Sachs eyes deal windfall as earnings smash forecasts," July 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Deals worth $1.5 trillion were announced in the three months to June 30 despite slowing activity among blank-check firms, more than any second quarter on record and up 13% from the record first quarter of the year, according to Refinitiv data. Goldman's Chief Executive Officer David Solomon expects the deal bonanza to continue as company bosses look to re-position their business for the post-pandemic world, he told analysts on a conference call. ""Strategic discussions with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery,"" he said. ""We're seeing really broad engagement across our franchise."" A note of caution was sounded on the potential impact of President Joe Biden's executive order signed last Friday, urging agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices - a move that could make deals more difficult. ""It's something we'll have to watch very, very closely,"" Solomon said, adding that he expected ""a lot of discussion"" about whether large tech companies will be allowed to merge. Goldman's investment banking revenue rose 36% to $3.61 billion in the latest quarter. The bank comfortably held on to its top ranking on the league tables for worldwide M&A advisory, according to Refinitiv. The league tables rank financial services firms on the amount of M&A fees they generate. Total net revenue surged 16% to $15.39 billion, while diluted earnings per common share of $15.02 beat estimates of $10.24, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Trading, however, was a sour spot, as the bank hit tough comparisons with a year ago when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, sending markets into a frenzy. The global markets business, which houses the trading business, reported a 32% fall in revenue. Net revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies (FICC) trading fell by 45%. Net revenues from equities trading fell 12%. JPMorgan Chase & Co Goldman has been among the top performing bank stocks, rising 42%, in the year-to-date. The bank has benefited from this year's stock market boom but analysts question whether it will continue to cash in when markets return to normal. The bank's executives say changes to the business, including serving a wider range of corporate clients, have led to market share gains which Goldman can retain even when conditions get tougher. ""We picked up 160 basis points of market share through the first quarter, and that's allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us,"" Solomon said. The bank reiterated its confidence in hitting targets set at its first-ever investor day last year, including generating $1.3 billion in expense savings. Revenue in its consumer banking business, a focus for Solomon as he looks to diversify the business, rose 41% in the quarter, reflecting higher deposit and credit card balances.

wealth,"JPMorgan profit soars on recovery but questions linger over lending outlook, competition"," July 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Despite the stellar profits, JPMorgan's shares fell 2.5% as investors focused on emerging challenges for financial stocks. Analysts pressed executives about competition from digital upstarts, prompting Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to exclaim at one point: ""My God, the company is doing quite fine."" The country's largest bank, seen as a bellwether of the U.S. economy, was boosted by a surge in deal-making and the release of $3 billion it had set aside to cover feared pandemic losses, even as trading revenues slumped 28% from last year's record-breaking levels. As the national vaccination drive allows Americans to get back to work, JPMorgan's results showed consumer spending bouncing back. Combined debt and credit card spending was up 22% compared with the same quarter in 2019, when spending patterns were more normal. Travel and entertainment card spending returned to growth in June and was up 13% on the same period in 2019. ""We have bright spots in certain pockets and the consumer spend trends are encouraging,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said on a call. He cautioned, however, that with corporate clients and consumers flush with cash thanks to extraordinary economic stimulus and low interest rates, core lending revenues may not benefit this year from the economy roaring back to life. JPMorgan's consumer and community banking unit reported an 8% fall in net interest income, while average loans were down 3%. And even as profits reached $11.9 billion, overall revenues fell 7% to $31.4 billion. ""Rates and loan growth continue to be headwinds,"" Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote. He noted, however, that the jump in card spending and 9% organic growth in client investment activity were ""clear signs that the economy continues to improve."" JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking revenues declined 19%, mainly due to a 44% slump in bond trading from last year's high, which executives had warned was unsustainable. Buoyed by a boom in initial public offerings, equity markets were a bright spot with revenue up 13%. On a call with executives, analysts questioned Dimon over the bank's strategy to compete with digital upstarts at home and abroad - an area Dimon himself has said is a weakness for the industry - sparking frustration from the straight-talking CEO. ""Our bankers, our traders, our credit card, our debit card, our merchant services, our auto business, our digital, it's doing pretty good,"" he responded, acknowledging however that competition from tech-savvy players was ""going to be very tough."" JPMorgan is trying to crack Britain's consumer finance market with slick technology-based offerings, while back in its home market President Joe Biden's administration wants to make it easier for fintechs to muscle into the banking sector. Asked whether JPMorgan would consider boosting its dividend, which it said last month would be $1 per share for the third quarter, Dimon said he wanted to invest in growing the bank. ""We don't want to raise the dividend so high that it cripples [our] ability to do other things."" DEAL-MAKING CHEER While trading revenue slumped 28% to $8.1 billion, the overall Wall Street banking business remained strong, driven by a record volume of large deals. Investment banking revenue rose to $3.4 billion as fees jumped 25%. Capital markets also remained active and a surge in IPOs more than compensated for a slowdown in blank check mergers. Goldman Sachs JPMorgan's overall profit exceeded analyst estimates, rising to $11.9 billion, or $3.78 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $4.7 billion, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. The country's largest lenders last year put aside billions to cover pandemic losses which, thanks to economic stimulus, did not materialize, allowing them to release those reserves.

Investors were ""much less bullish"" on growth, profits, inflation and yield curve steepening due to peaking economic growth and fiscal stimulus, the investment bank's top strategist Michael Hartnett said in a note. Though it's been just over a year since a new business cycle kicked off, 73% of the investors in the survey think the global economy is in either mid- or late cycle. Typically, markets display ""mid-cycle"" characteristics three to five years later. That has led to investors quickly switching sides: moving from junk to quality names, small caps to large caps and 'value' stocks to 'growth' stocks. Long tech was seen as the most crowded trade in the latest survey. Tech stocks, which are a part of the 'growth' basket, surged in the past few days as government bond yields slumped. Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rate expectations because their value rests heavily on future earnings, which are discounted more deeply when rates rise. Nearly 40% of the 270 panelists surveyed said they expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates in January 2023, pushing it back from November 2022 they had previously expected.

wealth,EXCLUSIVE Robinhood gives founders second chance at $1.4 billion windfall," July 9 (Reuters) - Stock-trading app Robinhood Markets Inc The company had agreed to award CEO Vladimir Tenev and chief creative officer Baiju Bhatt 13.8 million shares contingent on its share price reaching certain price levels at the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the executive compensation experts who analyzed the filing told Reuters in interviews. Robinhood tweaked the terms of the stock awards in late May so the founders will get a second chance to receive the shares if the IPO price does not meet the thresholds under the plan, according to the filing and the executive compensation experts. The change could cost Robinhood roughly $569.1 million in accounting expenses over time, according to the filing and one of the compensation experts. The company made the change to ""maintain the incentives"" of the stock award program, the filing states. Sarah Anderson, a program director at the Institute for Policy Studies whose research focuses on executive pay and inequality, said Robinhood's IPO would add to the wealth of Tenev, 34, and Bhatt, 36, thanks to their stakes in the company, and that changing the stock award terms to reward them further was questionable. ""Once you are already a billionaire, how much more of an incentive is this going to be for you to do a good job,"" Anderson said. Forbes pegs the net worth of Tenev and Bhatt at $1 billion each. A Robinhood spokesperson declined to comment or to make Tenev and Bhatt available for interviews. Under the original plan, Robinhood would have to be priced at a minimum of $30.45 per share in the IPO for Tenev and Bhatt to receive some stock, according to the filing and the executive compensation experts. It would have to be priced at $101.50 per share for Tenev and Bhatt to each receive the entire stock award worth $1.4 billion. Robinhood has not yet disclosed its targeted IPO price range, but in the filing it said that its board determined the fair value of its shares was $16.33 at the end of December. Under the modified plan, Tenev and Bhatt will have until the end of 2025 to hit the share price targets, the filing showed. Some executive compensation experts defended the changes that Robinhood made. The amended stock award program may be a better way for Robinhood to get the most out of its founders for the benefit of its shareholders long-term, even if it ends up costing the company, according to Eric Hoffmann, a vice president at compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC. This is because tying the awards solely to the IPO could have enticed the founders to keep the company private until they could hit the share price targets or push for an unsustainable valuation in the stock market debut. ""This does incentivize them over a longer period of time to drive up the stock price and increase shareholder value. A lot of people would argue that's a good thing,"" Hoffmann said. COURTING IPO INVESTORS The corporate governance arrangements of technology startups, including their executive compensation structures, are often scrutinized by IPO investors. Robinhood is expected to launch its IPO later this month, seeking to ""Changing 'in-flight' equity awards is often viewed negatively by investors,"" said Yonat Assayag, a partner at executive pay consultant ClearBridge Compensation Group LLC. More stock awards could be in the offing for the founders. In late May, Robinhood approved additional stock grants for Tenev and Bhatt tied to more ambitious share price goals ranging from $120 to $300, according to the filing. For Tenev, the value of the awards is $4.7 billion, and for Bhatt, $2.8 billion. Robinhood said in the filing that Tenev and Bhatt would not be granted any other equity awards through the eighth anniversary from when they received some of the stock, unless there are ""changes in circumstance or in our business."" Tenev and Bhatt, who founded Robinhood in 2013, slashed their annual base salaries in April from $400,000 to $34,248, which was the median wage for U.S. workers in 2019.

wealth,Column: New Alzheimer?�s drug clouds outlook for Medicare premiums next year," CHICAGO, July 12 (Reuters) - The decision by U.S. drug regulators last month to approve a controversial treatment for Alzheimer?�s disease could fuel an unusually large increase in Medicare premiums next year, but the outlook is clouded by a number of factors that will play out later this year. Biogen Inc's Medicare typically covers FDA-approved drugs - but this one comes with an eye-popping price tag set by its maker - $56,000 per patient annually. That figure does not include other associated care that could add tens of thousands of dollars of additional costs. Aduhelm will be administered by healthcare providers, and thus will be covered under Part B, rather than the Part D prescription drug program. And the impact on Part B finances could be huge. The premium paid by enrollees - which covers 25% of program costs - could rise sharply. So could the remainder of Part B costs, which are covered by all taxpayers. Predicting actual costs is speculative at this point due to uncertainty about the number of patients Medicare decides should have access to Aduhelm. But even a conservative estimate of $29 billion annually, from the Medicare?�s trustees will need to take into account the program?�s likely spending on Aduhelm in 2022 as it sets the Part B premium, which typically is announced in November. And the new drug likely will have other impacts on the costs experienced by Medicare beneficiaries. Many enrollees in traditional Medicare also have supplemental Medigap policies that cover their coinsurance costs. Premiums for those policies could rise as insurers anticipate higher outlays associated with Aduhelm. And 10% of traditional Medicare enrollees do not have supplemental coverage, so they would be subject to the program?�s 20% cost-sharing requirement for Aduhelm - roughly $11,500 per year. Out-of-pocket costs also would be an issue for enrollees in Medicare Advantage, the privately offered managed care alternative to the traditional program. Most Advantage enrollees are in plans that charge 20% coinsurance for Part B drugs provided in-network, mirroring the traditional program, according to Kaiser - the co-insurance rates can be much higher out of network. Medicare typically covers FDA-approved drugs, but it can conduct its own reviews in order to decide which types of patients should be covered. In the case of Aduhelm, Medicare could limit use to patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Just last week, the FDA narrowed its own recommendation for prescription of the drug, saying it should be used only with patients who have mild cognitive impairment or early dementia. Congress also could step in with legislation that mitigates any impact on Medicare enrollees. More broadly, the unusual FDA approval process and high cost for this drug could add fuel to the debate among legislators about broader drug-pricing reform. ?�This gives credence to the argument that the pharmaceutical industry cannot be relied on to deliver value to patients,??said Rachel Sachs, a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis who wrote about OTHER PRESSURES Two other factors could also put upward pressure on the Part B premium next year. Medicare increased the Part B premium this year by just $3.90, to $148.50 per month. But the increase actually was on track to be larger - Congress stepped in to cap it at 25% of whatever it would have been if Medicare had followed the usual formula, as part of a COVID-19 relief bill. That could set the stage for a larger ?�catch-up??increase this year. Healthcare utilization is another wild card. Despite the big surge in healthcare utilization last year associated with COVID-19, overall consumption of healthcare services fell dramatically during the lockdown last year. A key question is how this will impact utilization of services by Medicare enrollees next year. Utilization could be higher than normal as the pandemic recedes, putting further pressure on the Part B premium. THE COLA FACTOR The Aduhelm drama will play out against the backdrop of another pocketbook issue for seniors next year - the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The recent surge in inflation has some forecasters predicting a very hefty COLA next year. The widely watched Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) jumped 5% in May from a year earlier - the biggest gain since August  2008, when it rose 5.3%. The final COLA number will be decided by monthly data during the third quarter for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). But for seniors who are enrolled in both Social Security and Medicare, the key figure is the net COLA after the Medicare Part B premium is deducted. Typically, some portion of the COLA is gobbled up by higher Part B premium costs. (The dollar amount of the Part B increase is deducted from the dollar amount of the COLA.) Put it all together, and it could be a roller coaster ride this fall for seniors monitoring these pocketbook issues.

wealth,MSP Recovery to go public via nearly $33 bln mega SPAC deal," July 12 (Reuters) - MSP Recovery, which helps recover money from Medicare and Medicaid secondary payments, will go public through a deal with a blank-check firm, giving the combined company an enterprise value of $32.6 billion in the second biggest SPAC merger. The deal with Lionheart Acquisition Corp II MSP, led by billionaire entrepreneur John Ruiz, collects and analyzes data on the government-backed Medicare and Medicaid insurance claims, and then helps recover money owed to its clients, which include hospitals, health insurers and medical providers. ""Medicare and Medicaid pay billions of dollars of healthcare claims they should not pay. This harms taxpayers, the underprivileged, and America's senior citizens,"" Ruiz said. ""Our tools help fix this broken system."" Medicare Advantage plans cater to Americans older than 65 and those with disabilities. The Florida-based company, founded in 2014, earns a fee after a successful recovery. The Lionheart deal will help MSP quickly buy claims portfolios, while further growing its data-analytics capabilities, it said. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to take a private company public through a merger at a later date. Lionheart raised $230 million in an initial public offering in August. The company's shares were up 5.2% at $10.40 in trading before the bell. At $32.6 billion, the merger is second in size only to the nearly $40 billion deal inked in April between Southeast Asia's Grab and Altimeter Growth Corp The MSP deal is also the largest since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was considering new rules to protect investors amid a surge in the use of SPACs as capital-raising vehicles. It also pointed to a rebound in merger activity in the blank-check space after Wall Street's appetite showed signs of waning following a period of frenetic deal-making using the investment vehicle. In the past few months, biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks and SoftBank-backed mortgage startup Better HoldCo have announced multi-billion dollar deals with blank-check vehicles. Lionheart stockholders who do not redeem shares of its common stock will be issued more than 1 billion warrants in connection with the merger, the company said. MSP's founders will sell an equivalent number of their shares back to the company so that the provision won't dilute the stock's value. MSP will list its stock on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""MSPR"". Its existing and additional warrants will trade as ""LCAP W"", and ""MSPR W"", respectively. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods served as the financial adviser to MSP, while Nomura Securities advised Lionheart. The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021.

wealth,Explainer: What is open banking?," July 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order on Friday that asks the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules giving consumers full control of their financial data to make it easier for them to switch lenders . The measure was seen as a big win for financial technology startups in the United States and other proponents of ""open banking."" W
                hat does open banking mean and what is its significance? Open banking describes the process of banks and other traditional financial institutions giving customers and third parties easy digital access to their financial data. This includes being able to download and share information about account balances, payments, transactions and investments. The term can also refer to allowing a third party to initiate transactions from a customer's account, such as sending a payment or withdrawing money. Why would I want to share my financial data with a third party? Consumers may want to share their banking data with other providers to get better and cheaper services than what they already have. For example, an online wealth management startup might be able to offer better financial advice with a full picture of a consumer's assets and liabilities. To do so smoothly, it would need access to all the information in digital form, and in real time. Easy access to data also, in theory, makes it easier for customers to leave one provider for another. Quickly moving information like direct debit instructions or frequent payees removes some of the burdens that prevent people from switching banks. Why does open banking matter? Proponents say customers should have access to their data so that they can get cheaper and better services. Open banking would also foster greater competition, they say, and customers, not banks, should get to decide who sees their information. Critics, including many in the banking world, argue that the industry is already competitive and that privacy and cybersecurity concerns should supercede other considerations. Because it is expensive to maintain and protect customer data, banks have also resisted giving away the information for free. Have regulators stepped in before? Yes.

wealth,Analysis: U.S. IPO market a danger zone for Chinese firms after Beijing crackdown," HONG KONG/NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - China's stepped-up scrutiny of overseas listings by its companies and a clampdown on ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc On Tuesday Beijing said it would strengthen supervision of all Chinese firms listed offshore and tighten rules for cross-border data flows, a sweeping regulatory shift that is also set to weigh on the long-term valuations of the IPO-bound companies, they said. Bankers and investors expect the pace of activity to slow in the near-term as investors grapple with Beijing's decision to tighten supervision of firms listed offshore, coming just days after regulators stunned investors by launching a cybersecurity investigation into Didi. ""It suffices to say those Chinese companies already planning to list in the U.S. will have to pause, or even abandon the plans altogether, in the face of mounting uncertainties and confusions,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital Group. ""The U.S. market is off limits, at least for now,"" said Hu, whose private equity firm's portfolio include a number of tech companies that have gone public overseas. ""...The stakes are extraordinarily high, for both the tech companies and for China as a country."" U.S. capital markets have been a lucrative source of funding for Chinese firms in the past decade, especially for technology companies looking to benchmark their valuations against listed peers there and tap an abundant liquidity pool. A record $12.5 billion has been raised so far in 2021 in 34 offerings from listings of Chinese firms in the U.S., Refinitiv data shows, well up from the $1.9 billion worth of new listings in 14 deals in the year-ago period. Analysts say China's moves to look more closely at firms venturing overseas add a new layer of uncertainty for firms already struggling to navigate escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over a broad range of issues. ""The message is that for a successful overseas listing, Chinese regulators must be involved, as well as international cooperation with overseas regulatory bodies,"" said Louis Lau, California-based Brandes Investment Partners' director of investments. ""Overseas-listed Chinese companies may have had the mistaken impression that it can ignore Chinese regulators just because they are not listed in China,"" Lau, whose company holds Chinese stocks, told Reuters. The broader regulatory clampdown and Didi's listing dustup drove the S&P/BNY Mellon China Select ADR Index, which tracks the American depositary receipts of major U.S.-listed Chinese companies, down 3.4% on Tuesday. 'CLEAR SIGNAL' Catching many investors, and Didi, off-guard, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on Sunday ordered the ride-hailing firm to remove its apps from app stores in China for illegally collecting users' personal data, less than a week after it made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange following its $4.4 billion initial public offering. It was the largest Chinese IPO in the U.S. since e-commerce giant Alibaba Group  raised $25 billion in 2014. For investors, the euphoria was shortlived, with Didi's  shares diving nearly a third since its debut on June 30. The stock fell for third consecutive session on Wednesday, ending down 4.6%. The CAC also announced probes into Kanzhun Ltd's ""It's a clear signal that the Chinese government is not particularly happy that these firms continue to decide to raise capital in the west,"" said Jordan Schneider, a technology analyst at research firm Rhodium Group. The measures come as the U.S. securities regulator in March   began rolling out new regulations that could see Chinese companies delisted if they do not comply with U.S. auditing rules.

wealth,"Analysis: U.S. bond managers say market has overshot, yields too low"," NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Investors at some of the largest U.S. asset managers are holding fast to the view that bond yields will move higher in the second half of this year, despite the recent slide in Treasury yields, which they see as a temporary move. An unwind of short bets against Treasury debt as well as growing concerns about the recovery of the U.S labor market and the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has pushed down longer-dated U.S. government bond yields. The benchmark 10-year yield  hit 1.296% on Wednesday and the 30-year yield  fell to 1.918%, the lowest since February for both. But big U.S. bond managers including BlackRock, PIMCO, DoubleLine and TCW still expect the reopening economy to drive growth and inflation, even if at a slower pace in the second half of this year, and send yields higher again. They see the broader move lower in yields since mid-May, and the accelerated move on Tuesday and Wednesday, as largely the result of investors' unwinding an overblown bet earlier in the year on higher rates. ""The view for a while there in February and March seemed very clear,"" said Gregory Whiteley, U.S. government securities portfolio manager at DoubleLine. ""Everyone was getting on board, everyone was getting short, every strategist you heard from was calling for higher rates by the end of the year. ""And it does seem like it got a bit ahead of itself,"" he said. ""Everyone was on one side of the boat, everyone had the same outlook, and then the doubts started to creep in."" But Whiteley said bond yields have ""gone too far to the downside now, so we've overshot in the other direction."" Some traders said the move this week was due to an unwind of bets by hedge funds. A weekly survey of JPMorgan clients on July 6 showed that net bearish bets against Treasuries fell to their lowest level since April. ""The recent rally hasn't changed our fundamental outlook. This move for us looks more technical,"" said Bret Barker, Treasury portfolio manager at TCW, who sees the 10-year yield at 1.6%-2% by the end of the year. A June Reuters poll showed that fixed income strategists expected the 10-year yield to rise to 2.0% by June 2022. The so-called reflation trade - bets on skyrocketing inflation and growth - drove yields up to pre-pandemic levels in March. But longer-dated yields have fallen as inflation expectations have dropped. Jobs data for April, May and June that showed a mixed picture of the U.S. labor market recovery has also dampened some growth expectations. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. service sector activity grew at a moderate pace in June. ""Right now the reflation trade is not dead, but it's certainly hibernating,"" said Michael Sewell, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, who sees yields rising, though he believes the 10-year peaked for 2021 in March at 1.776%. Erin Browne, portfolio manager for multi-asset strategies at bond giant PIMCO, pointed to a ""pretty significant flattening"" of the yield curve in recent months, driven by inflation breakeven rates that have fallen since hitting multi-year highs in mid-May. The spread between two- and 10-year yields  - the most common measure of the yield curve ??has narrowed by more than 50 basis points since hitting a six-year peak in March. ""All of that is telling you that the market is reaching this peak growth, peak inflation inflection point. And that really accelerated yesterday and today,"" said Browne. The move this week has driven yields below fair value, said Browne, who expects to see the 10-year yield at 1.5%-2% in the second half of 2021. Asset managers have been looking for ways to take advantage of the moves. BlackRock in its mid-year investment outlook presented Wednesday said it views current bond market valuations as ""very full"" and has turned more bearish on U.S. Treasuries. ""We've used that opportunity of falling yields to establish a shorter or a more underweight duration position,"" said Scott Thiel, chief fixed income strategist at BlackRock, during the presentation.

wealth,Analysis: Falling U.S. bond yields may signal death knell for 'reflation' stock trade," NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Stock investors are watching the dramatic moves in the Treasury market for clues on the fate of one of this year?�s most successful plays - the so-called reflation trade that helped power shares of economically sensitive companies higher after nearly a decade of underperformance. Investors piled in to shares of energy producers, banks and other companies expected to benefit from a powerful economic rebound earlier this year while betting that Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, would rise. That trade appears to be tottering now, as worries over slowing growth send yields tumbling to their lowest level since early 2021. [nL2N2OK0R4] While stock markets have appeared largely placid, with the S&P 500 hovering near a record high, a rotation beneath the surface has accelerated in recent weeks, as investors move out of economically sensitive names and back in to the big technology and growth stocks that led markets higher for most of the last decade. ""If we do see a further drop in interest rates, if we do get below that 1.3% level in any kind of meaningful way, that is going to confirm that growth over value has returned and it is not just a head fake,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. Stocks pulled back on Thursday, with the S&P 500 down more than 1% in early trade. The S&P 500 had gained 7% through Wednesday since the 10-year Treasury yield hit a recent high in mid-May. A look under the hood, however, shows signs that a change in stock-market leadership may be taking place. The Russell 1000 growth index ""We do not expect the reflation and rotation trades to return to their former glory,"" while materials and energy stocks will likely be held back by falling commodity prices, noted Oliver Allen, markets economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. ""The big boost to rotation from recovering risk appetite and rising growth expectations may mostly be over,"" he said.  Concerns about the economic impact of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and falling commodity prices are helping push bond prices higher. At the same time, the Federal Reserve surprised many investors last month with a hawkish turn that suggested two interest rate hikes by 2023, calling into question its commitment to allowing inflation to run hot for a time. One key question for investors is whether recent signs of rising inflation - including the latest data on existing home prices, which showed them rising by their fastest pace in 15 years in April - will be short-lived. Federal Reserve officials last month felt further progress on the U.S. economic recovery ""was generally seen as not having yet been met,"" but agreed they should be poised to act if inflation or other risks materialized, minutes of the central bank's June policy meeting showed. ""The market going into the last FOMC meeting assumed that the Fed was comfortable with an inflation overshoot, but it became clear that the magnitude of how comfortable they were with an overshoot came down considerably,"" said Mike Sewell, a portfolio manager T Rowe Price, who expects that the 10-year Treasury has already hit its highest level for the year. Stocks??relative calm does not mean that equity investors are impervious to growth worries.

wealth,Poorer US households gained nearly a year's spending from CARES Act - study," July 6 (Reuters) - Federal aid distributed as part of the CARES Act boosted U.S. households' ability to pay their bills after becoming unemployed, with lower-income households seeing the biggest gains, according to The median household would have been able to maintain spending for an additional 15 weeks after losing employment income with help from enhanced unemployment benefits and the direct cash payments delivered as part of the relief bill, passed in March 2020 to support the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic. Low-income households were able to maintain their spending for 43 weeks longer after losing their jobs than they could have without the support, the study found. For higher-income households, the benefits added a median of seven weeks of spending. Enhanced jobless benefits had the biggest impact on what researchers called ""household resilience,"" or the ability for people to keep paying their bills after losing employment income. The supplement, which tacked on $600 a week to state unemployment benefits from mid-April through July 2020, accounted for 85% of the change for lower-income households, they found. Black and Hispanic households gained 19 weeks of resilience from the unemployment benefits, receiving a larger boost than white and Asian households. Households in the South and the Midwest were less financially prepared to deal with job loss than those in the Northeast and the West, but the CARES Act narrowed some of those disparities. The analysis focused on a sample of 10,613 heads of household and their spouses, using census bureau data. It did not factor in the aid provided after the CARES Act lapsed, which included more direct cash payments and an extension of enhanced jobless benefits.

wealth,Factbox: What Robinhood's IPO filing says about the Reddit army," July 2 (Reuters) - The typical soldier in the army of retail traders upending Wall Street is a 31-year old who grabs their smartphone seven times a day to check the assets in their first-ever brokerage account, which may well hold a good chunk of cryptocurrencies in addition to stocks. Those broad strokes describing retail traders are among the nuggets found in the July 1 filing by online brokerage firm Robinhood Markets, which is aiming for an initial public offering worth over $40 billion. In its filing, the firm includes facts about its more than 18 million customers and describes some of the potential risks of investing in the company, which increased its headcount from 289 in December, 2018 to more than 2,100 in March of this year as retail trading took off. The detailed breakdown of Robinhood's user base offers a glimpse at the individual traders gathering in online forums such as Reddit?�s WallStreetBets, whose activity has helped fuel wild rides in shares of video game retailer GameStop Here are a few highlights from the filing: -- As of March 31, 2021, the median age of customers on the company?�s platform was 31. -- From January 1, 2015 to March 31, 2021, over half of the customers funding accounts on the platform said Robinhood was their first brokerage account. -- Customers visited the app an average of nearly seven times a day in 2020, a year that saw wild swings in markets in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. -- The firm believes that close to 50% of all new retail funded accounts opened in the United States from 2016 to 2021 were new accounts created on Robinhood. -- Robinhood's assets under custody at the end of 2021?�s first quarter include roughly $65 billion in equities, $2 billion in options, $11.6 billion in cryptocurrencies and $7.6 billion in cash. -- Cryptocurrencies have been huge for the company. In the first quarter, Robinhood saw over 9.5 million customers trade about $88 billion of cryptocurrency on the platform. Crypto assets have grown 23-fold between March 31, 2020 and the end of this year's first quarter. -- A substantial portion of the recent growth in Robinhood?�s net revenue is earned from transactions attributable to Dogecoin, the company said. The price of Dogecoin, which has been touted by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has surged by more than 10,000% in the past year, according to Coingecko.com. ?�If demand for transactions in Dogecoin declines and is not replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies available for trading on our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected,??the filing said. -- Most Robinhood customers are primarily buy-and-hold investors, the company said, echoing a refrain often heard on WallStreetBets, where users exhort each other to hold onto their favorite meme stocks in the face of eye-popping volatility.

wealth,Overthinking Your Money: Avoiding analysis paralysis," NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - When it comes to your finances, there are a couple of ways to sabotage yourself. One is not putting enough thought into it. The other is putting too much thought into it. Overthinking ??becoming obsessed with minor details, twisting yourself into a pretzel, getting overwhelmed with choices and doing nothing ??can be just as damaging to your financial future as the opposite. ?�It?�s the paradox of choice: The more information we have, the less we can process it all, and the brain kind of short-circuits,??says Melody Wilding, an executive coach and author of the new book ?�Trust Yourself: Stop Overthinking and Channel Your Emotions for Success at Work?? Sound familiar? It?�s not just a few of us: 73% of those ages 25-35 struggle with overthinking, according to one study from the University of Michigan. You don?�t have to tell financial advisers, who see this all the time. Just ask Dana Anspach. The founder and CEO of Scottsdale, Arizona advisory Sensible Money has one client, a Fortune 500 executive, who has too much money concentrated in company stock. ?�He constantly overthinks what the share price may do,??says Anspach, who admits the dithering makes her want to reach for the ?�shot glass and the bottle of tequila?? When forced to exercise options and sell, her client sits on the cash, ""overcomplicating the decision of when and how to invest it,"" Anspach adds, noting that in the past seven years, so-called ""analysis paralysis"" has cost him nearly $500,000. Indeed, in one famous study by author and Columbia Business School professor Sheena Iyengar, the more investment choices people had in their 401(k) plans, the lower percentage of participation ??even if there was the free money of a company match. And having more choices did not make plan participants better choosers. The more mutual funds savers could select from, the more they tended to retreat into bonds and cash. How can you overcome this tendency to overthink things, and actually make a solid money decision ??even if it?�s not perfect? A few pointers: TAKE THE DECISION OUT OF YOUR OWN HANDS If you have to actively decide to save something at the end of every month, that is 12 different times a year when that decision (or lack of decision) could go wrong. But if you schedule those paycheck deductions, you are removing your own worst tendencies from the equation. ?�Don?�t decide. Automate,??says Kerry Taylor, a Toronto-based money expert and founder of the site Squawkfox.com. ?�Reducing friction and the need to make financial decisions is the magic of behavioral economics. I?�m so into it.??GIVE YOURSELF A DEADLINE The brain?�s natural tendency is to go around and around, ad infinitum. So counteract that by limiting yourself to a defined period to make a money decision. ?�Many of my clients ?�timebox,??and put a cap on how much time they can spend deliberating,??says Wilding. ?�Limit the number of resources you will consult, rather than going down an endless rabbit hole. Pick a date, put it in the calendar, and even commit to it publicly.??CONSIDER OPPORTUNITY COSTS If you are obsessing over investing in the perfect stock at the perfect price, that is one decision. But the larger and more important decision, viewed over the long-term, is being in the market or not being in the market. That is the kind of mindset Anspach faced with another client, who was fixated on getting the ideal price for his current home before buying a new one in his desired location. While he hemmed and hawed, the housing market in his target community shot up ??and his dream home is now going to cost $200,000 more than he thought. PERFECT IS THE ENEMY OF GOOD Sure, we would all love to make a brilliant investment decision, like buying Apple stock for a few bucks in the early 2000s. But even if your decisions are not perfect, you can still make good ones. It may not always be a home run, but singles and doubles will still get you around the bases. ?�We tend to fall into trying to find the most perfect possible option, because we?�re so afraid of choosing wrong,??says Wilding ??one of whose clients made an elaborate spreadsheet comparing various kitchen blenders, and still couldn?�t pull the trigger. ?�But the cost of inaction can be huge. By not making a decision ??that?�s a decision, too.??Our Standards: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters."
wealth,"Credit Suisse to realign strategy this year, chairman says"," ZURICH, July 1 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Credit Suisse's top management are under pressure to come up with an overhaul plan after losing more than $5 billion in the rush to unwind trades by family office Archegos, on the heels of the collapse of $10 billion in funds backed by insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. Former Lloyds Chief Executive Horta-Osorio assumed the role in the midst of these scandals, in late April. Describing his first seven weeks in the job -- during which he met with employees, as well as Swiss politicians and Swiss, U.S. and British regulators -- as ""intensive,"" Horta-Osorio said the bank needed a realignment that would clear up short-term crises but also position it for the long term. ""I have a clear picture of the direction the bank must take,"" he said in the interview with Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung published on Thursday. ""For me the question isn't, 'what do we need to do to ensure it works this time?' The question is much more, 'why isn't the bank making progress, despite having a fantastic group of wealth management clients in Switzerland, Europe and high-growth Asia?'"" he said, adding the bank's major strength lay in serving entrepreneurs and wealthy families. ""We need to agree on how we can best serve these customers and on where we are most competitive - on what that means for the bank as a whole,"" he said. To ensure success, the bank would need not only the right strategic direction, but also ""the right people in the right place,"" he added. Describing the recent failings at Switzerland's second-largest bank as unacceptable, Horta-Osorio compared the 165-year-old lender to a racecar driving on a highway with its wheels on wrong and promised no quick fixes, saying cultural shifts take time. Executives It is considering Some executives have debated steps such as spinning off its local Swiss bank to prepare the rest of the business for a merger, pruning back investment banking or selling its asset management business, sources said at the time.

wealth,Growth stock comeback fuels Cathie Wood's ARK funds," NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - A more than 10% surge in growth stocks since the start of the quarter is fueling a comeback in star stock picker Cathie Wood's ARK funds, which posted some of the worst declines among all U.S. equity funds over the first three months of the year. The ARK Innovation fund Driving the gains are declining fears of runaway inflation and the failure of U.S. bond yields to follow through on their dramatic first-quarter rally, accelerating a rotation back in to the sort of hyper-growth stocks that helped Wood post the best returns of all actively managed mutual fund managers in 2020 tracked by Morningstar. Monday's move was also helped by breakthroughs in gene editing announced on Saturday which boosted the shares of several biotech companies Wood's firm holds in several of its funds, including its flagship Ark Innovation fund. ""Investors have been rewarded for staying loyal to ARK and their long-term growth strategies as fears of rising interest rates were diminished,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. ""ARKK has significantly outperformed the broader market in the past month and is now in the black after being down double digits."" Among Wood's holdings are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc Overall, the Russell 1000 Growth index The Federal Reserve took many investors by surprise with a more hawkish turn at its most recent policy meeting, sending the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury below 1.5% on expectations that the central bank would be less tolerant of rising inflation. That has helped bolster tech and growth stocks, as rising yields threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows. Despite ARK's recent gains, the performance of its flagship fund remains in the bottom 100th percentile among U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data. Whether the fund continues its recent hot streak will largely depend on the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. ""There's a high correlation between the 10-year and whether it's growth or value overall,"" as lower yields eat in to the profits of cyclical stocks such as financials, he said. While growth stocks are outperforming now, Paulsen remains skeptical the rally will continue. ""Growth is going to be really strong in the economy this year and next and I don't think we have seen the last of the inflation scare,"" he said.

wealth,MUFG board beats back climate resolution as activists falter in Japan," TOKYO, June 29 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Activist investors in Europe and the United States trying to halt climate change have successfully compelled companies to divest their fossil fuel holdings but the tactic has failed in Japan so far. This is the fourth time since 2020 a so-called shareholder climate resolution has been defeated after being brought before a Japanese listed company. Japanese boards have benefited from the backing of domestic institutional investors that tend to defer to management. Mitsubishi UFJ is Japan's biggest lender and backs numerous coal and fossil fuel projects. A Mitsubishi UFJ spokesperson confirmed via email that the resolution failed during its annual general meeting, garnering about 23% of the shareholder vote. Mitsubishi UFJ's board opposed the resolution saying the ""essential content"" of the proposal ""has already been incorporated into the company's management strategies,"" with a recent carbon neutrality pledge and other policy changes. Non-governmental organizations Kiko Network and Rainforest Action Network offered the resolution, supported by a number of shareholders, including EOS at Federated Hermes, which focuses on sustainable investing. ""While we welcome the recent updates to the company's policies and the net zero commitment for 2050, we do not believe these are sufficiently aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" Sachi Suzuki, associated director for engagement at EOS at Federated Hermes, said in an email.

wealth,Qatar Petroleum hires banks for four-tranche jumbo bond sale," DUBAI, June 28 (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum has hired a group of banks to arrange a four-tranche issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, a document showed, for what will be its debut public bond sale months after it signed a contract to boost its liquefied natural gas output. The bond sale will comprise conventional tranches of five, 10 and 20 years, as well a 30-year Formosa portion, the document from one of the banks on the deal and reviewed by Reuters showed. Formosa bonds are sold in Taiwan by foreign borrowers and denominated in currencies other than the Taiwanese dollar. The document did not give any indication on the size of the deal but sources have previously told Reuters the planned debt sale could raise up to $10 billion. Qatar Petroleum (QP), one of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, hired Citi and JPMorgan to coordinate the issue. They, along with BofA Securities Fitch Ratings assigned QP a long-term issuer default rating of AA- with a stable outlook on Monday, which it said was ""constrained by that of sole shareholder - Qatar (AA-/Stable) - given strong links between the company and the sovereign"". ""Fitch assesses the Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) of QP at 'aa+', which is supported by the large scale of its LNG franchise, low production costs, large reserve base and conservative leverage,"" Fitch said, adding QP operations' focus on gas ""makes it better placed for energy transition than other oil and gas majors."" QP's fundraising comes as energy companies in the region seek different means to raise cash after they were hurt last year by the double shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil prices collapsing. QP signed a contract in February for the first phase of its North Field LNG expansion project, which aims to boost Qatar's LNG output by 40% a year by 2026. Fitch said key constraints on QP's rating include completion risk for large capital expenditure projects related to increasing LNG production, as well as political risk.

wealth,"Fearing predators, Credit Suisse seeks new look or even merger-sources"," ZURICH, June 25 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's top management are under pressure to come up with an overhaul plan for the scandal-hit Swiss bank that could include a potential merger with rival UBS The bank's executives fear the flagship Swiss lender, left vulnerable by scandals, could be challenged by investors demanding its break-up, or that its shrinking stock-market value makes it a target for a foreign hostile takeover, those people said. New chairman, Antonio Horta-Osorio, announced a strategic review in late April, telling investors he would take time in reaching hard decisions that lay ahead. The bank's senior management are due to meet next week, one source said, while another person with knowledge of the matter said top executives wanted to examine restructuring proposals in early July. The Swiss bank has had to review its business after losing more than $5 billion in the rush to unwind trades by family office Archegos. It faces a barrage of legal action for helping clients invest $10 billion in bonds issued by collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. The bank's shares have dropped by more than a quarter since early March, when its problems with Greensill were exposed. ""Credit Suisse needs a merger deal right away,"" a person with knowledge of the bank's thinking told Reuters. ""There is growing concern in Zurich that activist investors will go after them if they stand still."" Some executives have debated steps such as spinning off its local Swiss bank to prepare the rest of the business for a merger, pruning back investment banking or selling its asset management business, two of the people said. A third said selling the U.S. investment bank was also an option. Management discussions on any restructuring are preliminary and while they are in full swing, no decisions have yet been taken, the people said. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. The bank's management needs a new-look Credit Suisse, as its standing with customers and in Switzerland hits a low ebb. In April, Swiss supervisor FINMA said it had opened enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse following Archegos and that it would investigate risk management shortcomings. Swiss regulators are exasperated with what they see as the bank's freewheeling culture, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter. Credit Suisse's shrunken market valuation makes it worth a fraction of some of the big Wall Street banks, which have also been touted as potential suitors. But any U.S. takeover would not be well received in Switzerland. Relations between Swiss banks and Washington were damaged when the United States pressured them into giving up their strict secrecy code more than a decade ago. 'DISAPPEAR IN FOREIGN HANDS' A merger with UBS would be more palatable, the people said. ""The Swiss establishment is aware that without a domestic merger Credit Suisse will disappear in foreign hands,"" one of the sources said. But the combination of Credit Suisse-UBS would have a dominant position in the Swiss market, a concern for regulators who could also demand that a combined group bolster its capital. Credit Suisse could split out its Swiss bank to address competition concerns, one source said. Credit Suisse-UBS would have workforce of more than 110,000 and a market value of more than $85 billion. Earlier this year, when asked about a tie-up with Credit Suisse, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers threw cold water on the idea, saying he preferred ""organic"" growth. Any M&A deal for Credit Suisse would mark the end of a national icon, founded to finance the country's pan-Alpine railways and central to Switzerland's transformation from a farming nation to financial powerhouse. In early trading on Friday, Credit Suisse shares were up 2.8% while UBS shares were down 0.2%. Credit Suisse also got a boost after the Federal Reserve stress tests found capital levels at its U.S. arm would withstand a severe economic downturn. For such a flagship, the Swiss may prefer a home-grown solution to the prospect of a takeover by a foreign bank. A cross-border merger would be complicated because it would be unclear whether Switzerland or another host country would have control. UBS, for instance, held merger talks with Germany's Deutsche Bank Deutsche CEO Christian Sewing has expressed interest in participating in European bank mergers. But many people who spoke to Reuters for this story, however, believed a deal between Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse was unlikely.

Jacob Frenkel, an attorney with Dickinson Wright who has defended companies against allegations of stock manipulation and was not involved in the Farmland case, said Mathews' apology and payment could build company confidence to pursue similar claims against short sellers. ""It's highly unusual and refreshing to see a company take on this fight, because most will take the short term blow of the attack without pursuing legal vindication,"" Frenkel said. George Moriarty, the former executive editor of Seeking Alpha, told Reuters in 2019 that courts had respected the website?�s status as a neutral platform, and that its staff vetted all posts ( After the retraction, Seeking Alpha on Monday took down all articles by Mathews, including the original post on Farmland, and blocked his account, according to website representative Abby Estikangi-Carmel.

wealth,Spain's Acciona seeks $11.6 bln valuation with renewables IPO," MADRID, June 17 (Reuters) - Spain's Acciona The deal targets a lower valuation than the 12.1 billion euros achieved by Vodafone's infrastructure unit Vantage Towers The energy and infrastructure group said in a statement it planned to price its energy unit on the domestic stock market at between 26.73 euros and 29.76 euros per share, raising as much as 2.45 billion euros without taking into account an over-allotment option to the joint global coordinators of the deal. The planned IPO, which initially offers between 15% and 25% of its renewable business and is the largest in Spain in more than six years, has been one of the most closely watched deals in Europe. Renewable energy stocks have pulled back from their January highs, casting some doubt over whether the sector would be as warmly viewed by investors as previously. Smaller renewable firm OPDenergy pulled a planned Madrid IPO earlier this year, while Ecoener Investors are clamouring for businesses that can help the world's economies shift away from fossil fuels and stave off potentially catastrophic climate change. With the so-called greenshoe option of between 10% and 15% of the offer, the deal could be worth up to 2.817 billion euros. The IPO, addressed to qualified investors, will be carried out through the placement by parent company Acciona of ordinary shares of its unit, under the terms set in the prospectus to be submitted to the CNMV, it said. The price range would give its energy unit a valuation of between 9.8 billion euros and 8.8 billion euros, higher than the current group's valuation of 7.56 billion euros. Acciona said its renewables energy unit would apply for admission to negotiation on the Spanish stock market without providing a date.

""We have taken a conservative view for the level of the current return of capital, but if markets continue to recover, we expect to announce a further significant return next year,"" CEO Simon Peckham said. Melrose's current return plans equal 15 pence per existing ordinary share for shareholders, it said, adding that there were some encouraging signs for its aerospace division after the coronavirus pandemic hit it hard. The division had squeezed out a modest profit in the first quarter compared with a loss last year, helped by cost cuts. London-listed Melrose, which has also warned growth would be hit by a shortage of chips in the automotive supply chain, said the group was trading in line with expectations ahead of interim results on June 30. Shares of the company were up 1.6% at 161 pence by 0717 GMT. The stock lost nearly 26% of its value last year and is down 11% for 2021 as of Monday's close. Melrose said there was recovery in demand for cars and powder metals, and these divisions, including automotive, had been ""significantly"" cash generative. The owner of GKN, which supplies parts to carmakers such as Volkswagen, also said last week it had disposed of another business, Brush, for 100 million pounds.

wealth,CAS urges At Home investors to reject $37 a share take-private deal," BOSTON, June 18 (Reuters) - At Home Group Inc?�s CAS, which owns 17% of At Home's shares, said private equity firm Hellman & Friedman's new offer to pay $37 a share, representing a $1 per share bump, is not nearly sufficient for a company valued at $2.4 billion and growing strongly as low mortgage rates and strong housing demand fuel home decorating. CAS said a ""reasonable take-out price"" would be $70 a share. At Home agreed to sell itself to H&F last month for $36 a share and said the deal included a 40-day ""go shop"" period to find other potential buyers. This week it said H&F raised its price and will start a tender offer to buy shares instead of letting shareholders vote on the proposed deal, in which a majority would be required for the deal to proceed. ""H&F?�s original offer of $36 per share and its recently revised offer of $37 per share grossly undervalue the Company and deprive stockholders of meaningful value. We urge you to reject H&F?�s insufficient tender offer,"" CAS founder and portfolio manager Clifford Sosin wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. He added that certain other shareholders are also opposing the ""insufficient, conflict-ridden deal."" Representatives for At Home and H&F did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The board of directors' special committee is trying to ""usher through a fire sale,"" Sosin wrote, adding that it failed to conduct a thorough strategic review and did not consult key shareholders like CAS before ""falling into H&F's arms this spring."" Since the deal was announced last month, the company's stock has largely traded between $36 and $37. It closed at $36.76 on Thursday. Sosin said At Home CEO Lee Bird, who guided some of the company?�s recent strong growth, stands to make more than $100 million in connection with the deal. He also said Bird has been in talks with H&F since 2017, according to proxy materials, which might have dissuaded other potential buyers from bidding.

wealth,"Analysis: As Fed taper inches closer, investors prepare for volatility ahead"," NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - As the Federal Reserve takes initial steps toward removing its massively accommodative policy, investors are preparing for the main show ahead. Fed officials on Wednesday penciled in ""The Fed is making it clear that they will wait and wade through a noisy summer of data to see a trend before they make a decision about liftoff,"" said Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. England expects to see greater bond market volatility leading up to the central bankers' confab in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August and remains focused on shorter-duration bonds in anticipation of a sustained economic recovery. The question of when exactly the Fed will pull back has hung over financial markets. Stocks ""The logical response to today?�s information is that interest rates are going to go higher, and they will probably be going higher faster than people may have thought,"" said Marcus Moore, assistant portfolio manager at Zeo Capital Advisors. A more extreme reaction could lay ahead if signs appear of stronger-than-expected inflation and other factors that could push the Fed to taper faster than anticipated, some market participants said. Powell said policymakers are not facing a situation where they are ""behind the curve."" ?�We have become more defensive because we don?�t think the bond market should have so much apathy to inflation,??said Thanos Bardas, co-head of global investment grade and senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. Consumer prices jumped 5% in May, the largest annual jump in 13 years, while supply bottlenecks recently pushed lumber prices to all-time highs before tumbling 40% from their records. The Fed?�s projections show Todd Thompson, managing director at Reams Asset Management, said wage pressures from a record number of 9.3 million job openings will force the Fed to move more quickly than many in the market anticipate given that real interest rates remain negative. ""With the economy running at a galloping pace, negative real interest rates are a disconnect to reality and that has to be reconciled"" through rate hikes, Thompson said. Ten-year Treasuries, which reflect gains after inflation, trade at a real rate of negative 0.75%. Douglas Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae, said he ?�would have thought there would have been more commentary??on the Fed?�s monthly purchases of $40 billion in mortgage-backed-securities. A recent Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at PIMCO, said the message from Wednesday's meeting was that the Fed is ""shifting away from managing downside risk to the economy to upside risk to inflation expectations."" ""One thing that came out of this is that maybe their tolerance for above-target inflation is a bit less than we thought,"" Wilding said. RISKS AS TAPER NEARS The current climate is stirring recollections of 2013 when investors felt blind-sided when then-Chairman Ben Bernanke, in an announcement, raised the idea of a gradual taper. Bond yields spiraled higher, with benchmark 10-year yields surging from around 2% when Bernanke made the comments on May 23 to 3% in early September. Many don't expect another tantrum. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote that he doesn't think tapering will create ""tangible stress to the economy or markets."" The biggest risk to markets, he said, ""would be an overheating paradigm where it is hard to predict how high input, or wage costs, could get."" While Wilding sees the possibility of ""a tapering type of announcement as early as September,"" she doesn't see a repeat of the 2013 tantrum. ""That's not to say that the bond market won't sell off but we are not worried about a violent selloff,"" Wilding said. For John Lekas, president of Leader Capital, the worry is that the rebound in the U.S. economy may peter out some time next year.

wealth,JPMorgan buys investment platform Nutmeg in UK retail push," LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase The U.S. bank is looking to take on established British retail banking rivals and a growing band of fintechs with plans to become a full-service retail bank under its Chase brand. It will compete with Goldman Sach's Nutmeg - which has more than 140,000 clients and more than  3.5 billion pounds ($4.89 billion) in assets under management - will form the basis of JPMorgan Chase's retail digital wealth management offering internationally, Nutmeg said in a statement. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a source close to the transaction said it valued Nutmeg at close to 700 million pounds ($972.79 million). Launched in 2012, Nutmeg aimed to upend the traditional wealth management market by offering lower cost automated financial planning services. While it quickly became one of Britain's best known financial technology companies and robo-advisers, it has yet to turn a profit. In its most recent set of full accounts for 2019, the group made a pretax loss of 22 million pounds. JPMorgan confirmed the acquisition and said it would complement the group's UK digital bank launch under its Chase brand later this year. ""We are building Chase in the UK from scratch using the very latest technology and putting the customer's experience at the heart of our offering, principles that Nutmeg shares with us,"" said Sanoke Viswanathan, CEO of international consumer at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan had already launched a product partnership with Nutmeg in November. The Nutmeg deal follows plans by rival U.S. bank Goldman Sachs group Inc Banking industry experts said that while Nutmeg's customer base is small relative to those of major banks, it will give JPMorgan an initial user base in Britain, where it does not yet have a consumer presence.

wealth,How to handle a bidding war in a hot housing market," NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Over the last few years, if you were trying to buy a home in the United States, you were typically up against one other bidder for sales that closed. Last fall, that average rose to two other bidders, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Last winter, that number rose to three. In April? Try four. Welcome to the era of the real estate bidding war. You do not have to tell John Colantoni. The law firm partner from Jersey City, New Jersey, was recently looking for a property in Pinehurst, North Carolina, frequent site of the U.S. Open golf championship. Unfortunately, so were a lot of other people ??which is why he and his investment partners got outbid three different times, usually by around $50,000. Finally, when they spotted an attractive four-bedroom for $300,000, they had enough of losing ??and had to go $40,000 over the asking price to win the bid. ?�It?�s a gold rush,??Colantoni says. Bidding wars are the natural outcome of a red-hot housing market. With economic growth and wages rebounding smartly from our pandemic year, COVID-19 pushing many families towards more spacious homes in the suburbs, huge investors getting into residential real estate and interest rates still relatively low, housing has found itself as a very attractive asset class. In fact, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index saw national home prices advance at a 13.2% annual clip in March, up from 12% the previous month. That is the tenth consecutive month of accelerating gains, and the fastest rise since December 2005. ?�The share of homes that sell above their list price, which usually indicates a bidding war, is more than twice what we were seeing a year earlier,??says Dan Handy, economic data analyst for popular real estate site Zillow. Upping your bidding game might require more due diligence on how your local market has been faring; knowing how long homes are staying on the market, and what they are tending to go for; and selecting the right terms to nudge sellers to pick your offer over others. It might also require flexibility ??to adjust your bid if need be, or to revise your expectations. And, as with any negotiations, it might require you to walk away. Here are a few tips from experts: DO NOT FALL IN LOVE If homes are getting five bidders apiece, it is very likely you are going to get outbid, perhaps multiple times. But you cannot lose focus. ?�Don?�t get emotionally attached to any home, and start imagining your lives there,??says Ryan Serhant, head of brokerage Serhant, star of Bravo?�s ?�Million Dollar Listing New York,??and author of ?�Big Money Energy?? ?�It?�s hard to do, but if you don?�t get a particular home, try not to be devastated about it.??RUN THE NUMBERS The obvious temptation in any bidding war is to offer the moon. But if that locks you into long-term debt that you cannot truly afford, then that?�s no solution. Instead, revise expectations about what your budget will get you: ?�Look for homes with list prices below your max budget, to provide some breathing room to make an above-list offer,??advises Zillow?�s Handy. BE REALISTIC In a more typical housing market, there are any number of terms where you can haggle with the seller ??from the timing of the closing date, to contingencies, to needed repairs. But in the current market sellers hold most of the leverage. That?�s the situation Colantoni faced, when the sellers wanted to rent their place back for a while until their new home was ready. ?�Anything we pushed back on, they had all the power,??he says. HAVE AN AGENT IN YOUR CORNER Especially in this hyper-competitive environment, it helps to tap the resources of an agent. They have relationships with other brokers, knowledge of properties that may not be officially on the market yet and can steer you to the price point that will actually get you the property. Says Serhant: ""Work with a strong agent and don?�t go into battle buck naked all by yourself.??The good news is that buyers can still come out on top in the long run. Like Colantoni, who looks to make a tidy sum from golf fanatics for years to come with his new Pinehurst purchase. ?�Within the first few days, we were booked solid for two months,??Colantoni says. ?�I don?�t think I?�ll ever sell that house.??Our Standards: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters."
wealth,EXCLUSIVE Deutsche Telekom seeks investors to bankroll German internet overhaul - sources," FRANKFURT, June 16 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom The deal is part of a German bid to catch up with other European countries such as Spain, which has outpaced Europe's industrial powerhouse by laying high-tech glass fibre cables while Germany is mainly stuck with old-fashioned copper lines. Deutsche Telekom, Germany's main telecoms company, has come under increasing pressure to act quickly as the coronavirus pandemic has forced more people to work from home and rely on fast, stable internet connections. The sources told Reuters that Deutsche Telecom and its adviser Deutsche Bank are targeting investors such as Dutch funds APG and PGGM and Canada's Brookfield Deutsche Telekom's initial plan is to roll out fibre cables to 4 million households and investors will be offered stakes equivalent to up to half of the project's equity, the sources said. Further extensions of the network are likely. The German company is following the strategy adopted by rivals, such as Spain's Telefonica Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bank and the prospective bidders all declined to comment. At the same time, the German telecoms giant is kicking off the sale of its T-Mobile Netherlands business to cut its debt and free up cash for investment in infrastructure. FOREIGN INVESTORS Deutsche Telekom is a laggard when it comes to fibre as it bet on improved copper cables to supply internet connections and only switched to focusing on faster fibre cables in 2019. Its move is part of a trend among German companies of turning to foreign investors to fund parts of the infrastructure that keeps the wheels of industry whirring, such as energy. Power network 50Hertz, for example, is now majority owned by Belgium's Elia Investment by China, however, is viewed sceptically. When China's State Grid wanted to take a stake in 50Hertz in 2018, German state lender KfW (KFW.UL) prevented the move. Fibre networks are typically financed with 30% equity and 70% debt and Deutsche Telekom is looking for investors to contribute half of the equity with it providing the rest. Telefonica struck a deal in October 2020 with German insurer Allianz Assuming a similar valuation, Deutsche Telekom's project to supply about 4 million households would be worth some 10 billion euros, meaning investors would need to contribute 1.5 billion euros, or half of the 30% equity. At its capital markets day in May, Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges underlined the company's commitment to accelerating the rollout of fibre in Germany, taking it from 600,000 households last year to 2.5 million in 2024. He said the company plans to invest 2.5 billion euros a year in fibre infrastructure. DUTCH MOBILE SALE Deutsche Telekom's plan would still leave it trailing countries such as Spain and Sweden, where more than 60% of homes already get their internet via fibre cables. In Germany, only 5% of homes have fibre, slightly lower than Italy. Deutsche Telekom executive Dominique Leroy has said its goal is to reach 10 million households with fibre by the end of 2024 and that it would seek partnerships where it makes sense. While Deutsche Telekom is preparing to invest billions, it is also faces a large bill to exercise options to raise its holding in T-Mobile U.S. However, it is already saddled with 130 billion euros of debt and is now selling businesses to reduce the pile. First in line is its subsidiary T-Mobile Netherlands, which is estimated to be worth up to 5 billion euros. The Dutch mobile business has 6.8 million customers and its sales last year came to 1.9 billion euros. Deutsche Telekom's adviser on the deal, Morgan Stanley Suitors including buyout groups KKR Warburg Pincus, which employs former Deutsche Telekom CEO Rene Obermann, came close to buying the business in 2015. Morgan Stanley and the potential bidders all declined to comment. Once that sale is out of the way, Deutsche Telekom may look to sell its telecom towers division, the people said, adding that while conversations with banks are taking place no decision has been taken.

Retail trading surged during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by a shift by retail brokerages to commission-free trading, with individual traders now responsible for around 35% of market volume, up from 20% pre-pandemic. In meme stocks, individual traders contribute as much as 70% of the volume, Cunningham said. The majority of retail orders bypass exchanges because of an arrangement called payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages sell their customers' marketable orders to wholesale brokers. The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better. Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.

With more than six months until the year ends, U.S. initial public offerings have already totaled $171 billion, eclipsing the 2020 record of $168 billion, according to data from Dealogic. Driving the IPO rush are sky-high corporate valuations in the stock market, inflated by the Federal Reserve's low-interest rates and monetary stimulus in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has fueled a wave of speculative frenzy that benefit not just traditional companies going public, but also special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) formed strictly to raise money through IPOs. The IPO gold rush is set to reach new heights in the second half of 2021, as a number of high-profile startups such as China's largest ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co Ltd, online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc and electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automative LLC prepare to launch multi-billion dollar share sales. ""If the markets hang in anywhere near where they are right now, we are going to be incredibly busy this summer, and into the fall with IPOs,"" said Eddie Molloy, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Morgan Stanley.

The average one-week return for 2021 is 35.7%, higher than 32.2% in 2020 and 25.5% in 2019. Capital markets bankers and lawyers estimate that companies could end up raising close to $50 billion through traditional IPOs, excluding SPACs, before the end of the September quarter. IPO proceeds have touched $24.1 billion in the second quarter through June 15, according to Dealogic. Didi's offering alone could raise close to $10 billion, sources have previously told Reuters. By the end of the year, U.S. IPOs could raise $250 billion to $300 billion or more - a staggering sum once considered unthinkable, according to investment bankers.

SPACs, or blank check companies, are listed shell companies that raise cash with the sole purpose of merging with a private company within two years of the listing. The process takes the private company public. During the first quarter alone, SPAC listings raised close to $100 billion, well above the $83 billion for all of 2020, according to data from SPAC Research. Despite the recent slowdown in SPAC dealmaking, 339 SPACs have been formed this year, raising roughly $105 billion or nearly two-thirds of the total IPO volume. In 2020, SPAC volumes accounted for less than half of the total IPO proceeds. ""Valuations are strong, fund flows are strong, and all the ingredients that you need to have an active and successful IPO market remain intact right now,"" said Bunzel. Investment bankers and lawyers also pointed out that the capital markets boom is attracting more companies that would have otherwise stayed private for longer, making the IPO pipeline even more robust for the foreseeable future. ""Because of the surge in SPAC transactions, a lot of companies are thinking this is an opportune time to hit the market and achieve attractive valuations.

wealth,Analysis: Transitory or here-to-stay? Investors try to read the inflation clues," NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - From lumber prices to wages and inventories: Reading the clues around inflation has turned into an investor obsession. The combination of supply bottlenecks from the reopening of the global economy and the resumption of economic growth sent consumer prices in May up by the largest annual jump in nearly 13 years. Employers are raising wages as they compete for scarce workers while retailers have limited inventories because of shipping and production delays. L2N2NR2Q5 As investors assess the risks of rising prices to financial markets, however, some think the biggest gains in inflation are already in the rear-view mirror. That is in line with the Federal Reserve's notion that inflation will be ""transitory."" The Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, and investors will parse every word of its post-meeting statement. The Fed has been buying $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities monthly, putting downward pressure on longer-term borrowing costs to encourage investment and hiring. Discussions about tapering those purchases are likely at this week's policy meeting. ""As long as the increase in inflation is modest, stocks could continue to move higher,"" said Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager of the $27.6 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund. Koesterich thinks inflation will likely run above trend lines well into 2022 given the bottlenecks in global supply chains. Yet disinflationary forces such as an aging global population and gains in efficiency due to technology will keep a lid on ""any 1970s-style inflation scare,"" he said. Investors who bet on inflation typically move into groups better-positioned to weather price rises, like materials and energy and companies with pricing power. Value stocks, in contrast, benefit from a broad economic recovery that does not become weighed down by steeply rising prices. Koesterich said his fund has been decreasing its positions in growth stocks like technology and adding to industrials and European banks. Jeff Mayberry, portfolio manager of the DoubleLine Strategic Commodity fund, thinks May's inflation numbers will be the highest for the remainder of the year and remains bullish on oil, which hit a multi-year high on Friday. He sees the commodity benefiting from economic growth. ""The market was looking for a reason for inflation to be transitory and they got it,"" Mayberry said of May's inflation number, noting that some of the larger contributors came from short-term factors such as a spike in the price of rental cars. Ernesto Ramos, chief investment officer at BMO Global Asset Management, also sees price rises as transitory. He cites a drop in lumber prices from May's high that suggests supply chain bottlenecks will subside and ""give us another reason to believe that inflation will remain under control."" Lumber prices are down more than 40% from record highs hit in early May. REASONS TO WORRY While the majority of investors believe inflation is transitory, according to a Bank of America fund manager survey, worries remain. ""Inflation has been the most discussed topic with clients for weeks, bordering on obsession,"" wrote analysts at Morgan Stanley led by Michael Wilson. Those analysts think the rate of change on inflation is peaking. Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. Fixed Income at Janus Henderson, said he has been buying more Treasury-Inflation Protected Securities as the break-even rate - a measure of expected inflation in the bond market - has retreated to near its February levels. While he is not ""changing my base case"" that high inflation  will prove to be transitory, ""the risks around the base case continue to skew toward the upside on inflation,"" given the persistent difficulties companies are having hiring lower-paid workers, Wilensky said. The Fed's statement could give important clues. ""I'm going to watch the Fed on Wednesday and if they treat these numbers with nonchalance it is a green light to bet heavily on the inflation trade,"" Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corp told CNBC on Monday. He said he would be ""really concerned arguing that inflation is transitory"" with inventories at a ""record low"" while demand is ""screaming."" Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman ""Even if investors disagree with the Fed's often-stated mantra that inflation is just transitory, they have learned to respect the massive influence the world's most powerful central bank has when possessing such conviction that is not even 'thinking about thinking' about easing its foot off the stimulus accelerator,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz.

wealth,Investors sue U.S. regulator over Trump-era AGM resolution rules," June 15 (Reuters) - A group of investors sued Wall Street's regulator on Tuesday over rule changes that raise the bar for filing resolutions at annual shareholder meetings to call for new priorities or reforms. The group is concerned that the changes, pushed through in 2020 by appointees of former U.S. President Donald Trump and set to take effect next year, will restrict shareholder democracy just as activist investors are starting to drive significant change in Corporate America. More top funds are throwing their weight behind investor challenges to companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and are putting companies on notice by choosing to publicize how and why they voted. The investors argue the new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules make it harder to hold companies accountable over hot-button issues such as climate change or workforce diversity, and want them set aside. ""This was a political rulemaking not warranted by the record or the evidence,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a California shareholder activist group and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The two other plaintiffs are James McRitchie, an individual investor and frequent filer of shareholder resolutions, and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents religious groups and other institutional investors. SEC representatives did not respond to questions about the lawsuit on Tuesday. SEC commissioners voted 3-2 along party lines last September for changes including raising the threshold value of shares investors must own to file resolutions and the support levels needed to resubmit them. Investors soon will need at least $25,000 of a company's shares if they want to file a resolution after they have held the stock for one year, for instance. They currently need to own at least $2,000 to do the same. They will be able to file a resolution owning $2,000 worth of stock only after they have held it for three years. Asked about the lawsuit, Tom Quaadman, an official who follows capital markets for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce trade group, said it supported the rule changes ""as they reflect the needs of global 21st century capital markets that must be competitive and not push the interest of special interest activists who push agendas unrelated to economic return.??GAINING TRACTION ESG resolutions have gained more traction lately.

Georgeson Senior Managing Director Hannah Orowitz, who said the company did not have a position on the regulations, said if left in place the changes would likely cut back on future ESG-related proposals despite their rising popularity. She cited one calling on Dupont Dupont representatives did not respond to questions. The Democratic administration of President Joe Biden has taken several steps to encourage sustainable investing, including a declaration by the Labor Department that it will not enforce Trump-era rules curbing the use of environmental and social factors in retirement accounts. Under new chair Gary Gensler, appointed by Biden in February, the SEC is gathering comments on such topics as how it might have companies report data like carbon emissions. Senate Democrats had introduced a resolution to undo the SEC changes on shareholder proposals, but a deadline to move it has passed. The investor lawsuit claims the Trump-era SEC failed ""woefully"" to account for the benefits to shareholders of allowing more resolutions, such as stronger corporate performance. It alleges the regulator placed undue emphasis on the costs of the resolutions for the companies, which the regulator has previously pegged at up to $150,000. The SEC also failed to account for a study by its staff that found the rules could reduce the number of resolutions up to 78%, the lawsuit states.

Half the U.S. states The White House official said the moves would have only a short-term impact on spending, and said President Joe Biden's COVID-19 relief plan was always intended to end when no longer needed. The child tax credit payments, which will reach millions of American households in July, including 88% of children in the country, would have a more lasting impact in reducing childhood poverty and boosting future earning potential, the official said, underscoring Biden's push to make the payments permanent. The overall outlook for the U.S. economy looked bright, the official said, citing upbeat forecasts from the World Bank and Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development that foresee growth of nearly 7% for 2021. The official said Biden's robust rescue plan and long-term investments were underpinning that growth, while the dropoff in supplemental employment benefits would be temporary, lasting just 90 days. The White House also remains confident that rising inflation will be transitory, the official said, adding that supply chain challenges, including a shortage of semiconductors that has constrained auto production, would ease in coming months. Producer prices were up, reflecting supply chain challenges in areas such as lumber, but some of those pressure were beginning to ease, the official said, citing a 40% drop in lumber prices from their peak in May.

A Vivendi spokesman on Monday said, ""The company has yet to see any evidence of a stake being built,"" in response to a question about the Third Point holding. A Third Point representative declined to comment. Third Point's stake was first reported by Bloomberg. Vivendi has become popular with certain investors ever since it announced plans to spin off 60% of Universal. Earlier this month Ackman said his blank-check company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Vivendi, controlled by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, last month set out a plan to list Universal, the world's largest music group, by Sept. 27. Investors will have a chance to vote on the proposed spinoff later this month and some have already expressed reservations. Activist fund Bluebell Capital Partners and investment fund Artisan Partners have raised concerns about the spinoff, decrying the transaction as unfavorable to some investors. Glass Lewis and ISS, the world's two biggest proxy advisers, have recommended Vivendi shareholders vote in favor of the spinoff plans. Third Point is trying to evaluate what Ackman's proposal would mean for Vivendi shareholders and has not commented publicly about the matter.

wealth,Breaking up Big Tech in focus as new U.S. antitrust bills introduced," WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced four bills on Friday aimed at reining in the power of the tech giants, with one potentially leading to their break-up.

""Bills that target specific companies, instead of focusing on business practices, are simply bad policy ... and could be ruled unconstitutional,"" the Chamber's Neil Bradley said in a statement. In contrast, Robert Weissman, president of advocacy group Public Citizen, said ""Big Tech?�s unchecked growth and dominance have led to incredible abuses of power that have hurt consumers, workers, small businesses and innovation. That unchecked power ends now."" Representative David Cicilline, the Democratic chair of the antitrust panel, is an original co-sponsor of the bills, as is the top Republican, Ken Buck. The chair of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, also sponsored the bills. A second measure would make it illegal in most cases for a platform to give preference to its own products on its platform with a hefty fine of 30% of the U.S. revenue of the affected business if they violate the measure. The third bill would require a platform to refrain from any merger unless it can show the acquired company does not compete with any product or service the platform is in. A fourth would require platforms to allow users to transfer their data elsewhere if they desire, including to a competing business.

wealth,"U.S. household wealth jumps to record $136.9 trillion, Fed says"," June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. household wealth jumped to a record $136.9 trillion at the end of March, a report from the Federal Reserve showed on Thursday, suggesting plenty of dry tinder for economic growth as the coronavirus pandemic recedes and the nation reopens. Rising equity markets drove the overall increase in wealth, adding $3.2 trillion to household assets in the first quarter. Rising real estate values added around $1 trillion, according to the U.S. central bank's latest quarterly report on household, business and government financial accounts. Overall U.S. household wealth rose $5 trillion from the fourth quarter. Balances in cash, checking accounts, and savings deposits swelled by about a combined $850 billion in the first quarter to a record $14.5 trillion, the report showed, bolstered by massive government aid aimed at blunting the economic fallout from the pandemic and bridging families to the other side of the crisis. The Fed report provides overall figures and does not shed light on the large differences between higher-income families versus poor ones, and those with jobs and those without. Still, it underscores the extra spending power at hand for U.S. families overall this quarter and beyond as COVID-19 cases continue to fall, and newly vaccinated Americans venture out and states lift their remaining pandemic-era restrictions. Economists project GDP growth this year will be the fastest in decades. The resurgence in economic activity, coupled with bottlenecks for key materials like semiconductors and widespread reports of companies unable to fill jobs, is pushing upwards on inflation, though Fed officials expect that to be temporary. Higher bank account balances reflected the $600 checks sent to most Americans under a pandemic aid package signed by former President Donald Trump in late December, as well as the bulk of the $1,400 checks that were part of President Joe Biden's relief package in March. The combined aid of the two packages totaled $2.8 trillion and included money for small businesses and local governments, as well as an extra $300 in weekly aid to the unemployed, though anything disbursed after March won't show up until the Fed's next quarterly report. The report showed overall household debt rose in the first quarter at an annualized rate of 6.5% compared to a 6.2% rise in the fourth quarter, as home mortgage borrowing accelerated. Households held $11 trillion in home mortgages as of March 31. Non-financial business borrowing accelerated to a 4.4% annualized rate, up from a 1.1% pace in the previous quarter, reflecting an increase in corporate bonds, the Fed said. Government borrowing rose at a 6.5% annualized rate versus 10.9% in the prior quarter.

wealth,Private equity vows to help the world. Lenders want proof," LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - Words can be cheap in the market for loans, now some lenders want to change that. In recent years, borrowers have been able to get a reduction in their interest costs in return for meeting targets linked to environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. That trend has been turbocharged this year by private equity firms seeking a piece of the action. ESG-linked loan issuance hit $87 billion during the first quarter, triple the amount over the same period last year, according to data provider Refinitiv. As billions pour into the market, some lenders are wary about relying on the word of borrowers that they are meeting targets on everything from reducing food waste to promoting more women. ""The burden of proof is going to rise. Be prepared for it,"" said Mark Wade, head of sustainability research and stewardship at Allianz Global Investors. Three industry associations that represent underwriters, law firms and asset managers in Europe, the United States and Asia revised their sustainability-linked loan principles last month. They now say borrowers must obtain independent, external verification of their performance against the targets, a change driven primarily by the investors who buy the loans and the lenders who arrange them, according to the London-based Loan Market Association. The changed guidance was prompted by developments across the wider loans market but it has coincided with private equity's move into sustainability-linked loans. Under pressure from their investors to show that their leveraged buyouts are not just about juicing returns, private equity firms, which often use leveraged loans rated below investment grade to finance the buyouts, have been responsible for 95% of the ESG-linked issuance in Europe's junk-rated loan market so far this year, according to financial intelligence provider Reorg Research. Disclosure has always been a challenge for loan investors and, in particular, creditors of private equity portfolio companies. Many are private companies, and, unlike bonds or stocks, loans are not public securities, so they are not bound by the same disclosure requirements. ""The biggest criticism we hear is the problem of having data to assess the situation,"" said Armin Peter, head of sustainable banking and global head of debt capital markets syndicate at UBS. LEVERAGED LOAN BOOM It is unclear how widely, and how quickly, the voluntary guidelines will be adopted. Some market observers expect it to be an evolution, with independent verification of ESG targets eventually becoming the norm as it has in the public bond markets. But in the short-term, the high demand for leveraged loans outstripping supply, on top of booming demand for ESG products, mean that borrowers often have the upper hand, enabling them to avoid third-party oversight. Issuance of ESG-linked leveraged loans this year was up 14-fold to 19 billion euros by May compared to 2020, according to Reorg. ""The sheer amount of liquidity on offer as compared to the number of high quality opportunities for deployment, does have an influence on terms being achieved,"" said Murad Khaled, head of EMEA leveraged finance capital markets at Bank of America, which has arranged sustainability-linked loans for companies backed by the likes of Carlyle and CVC. ESG-linked leveraged loans allow savings on the cost of borrowing between 0.05 and 0.15 percentage points if the targets are met, while costs rise similarly if the target is missed, according to Reorg. Nearly two thirds of the deals do not require a third-party to verify that ESG targets have been reached, Reorg data showed. To be sure, not all targets may need external verification if the data is readily available in a company's regular disclosures, investors and bankers say. But even within the private equity industry, demand is growing for oversight. Four months since buyout firm Carlyle Group negotiated a CHF413.5 million ($452 million) financing package for its acquisition of Swiss watch industry supplier Acrotec, it is still negotiating how to show key lender Blackstone that it is meeting its sustainability targets, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Carlyle was offered a loan by Blackstone Group Inc's It also negotiated a revolving facility whose borrowing costs are reduced if the funds are used for a project that has a ""measurable environmental benefit"". Blackstone wants an independent party to verify that Carlyle is meeting its targets, according to a source familiar with its stance. Carlyle, on the other hand, wants the third party involved only in the setting of the targets, and expects Acrotec's management to certify its compliance, another source familiar said. Carlyle's global head of impact Megan Starr said that its companies' self-reporting on sustainability targets was no different to how they report other data related to their debt covenants to creditors. ""They have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the data is accurate,"" she said.

Moran said a contract to provide the CLEAR online investigation software to ICE had expired in February. The software aggregates billions of data points and public records information for law enforcement agencies and financial services firms, according to a company website. The shareholder proposal came from a British Columbia labor union and focused on Thomson Reuters work with government agencies including ICE. The proposal won the support of 19% of the votes, Thomson Reuters Chairman David Thomson said at the meeting, which was webcast, more than double the 7.6% share that a similar resolution received last year. The tally potentially represented a majority of support from outside investors. The Woodbridge Co, representing the Thomson Reuters controlling Thomson family, owns two-thirds of the company shares and had planned to vote against the resolution, according to a securities filing. Final voting figures had yet to be filed and Moran did not provide additional details. Wednesday's resolution called for the company's board to produce a ""human rights risk report"" describing potential issues it faces and comparing risk-control procedures against those of other technology companies. Under the Trump administration that ended in January, ICE played Stephanie Smith, president of the union that sponsored the resolution, said in a statement the result showed ""Thomson Reuters is failing to tackle very serious and concerning human rights risks related to contracts with agencies like ICE, and shareholders aren?�t buying their excuses."" The company had opposed the resolution as unnecessary given existing internal controls. Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Officer Steve Hasker said at the meeting: ""We continue to see a net societal benefit to providing CLEAR and similar products to law enforcement,"" provided they are used as permitted by regulations.

wealth,The cost of caregiving: When financial and emotional stress compound," NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - When Lynda Steele's father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a couple of years ago, she faced an impossible choice. Continue as host of her popular Vancouver radio show, and try to juggle caregiving duties ??or step away from her job, and spend more time with her dad in the last months of his life? In the last week of May, she finalized that choice, and signed off the air. ""I went through periods of great guilt, thinking of my dad by himself in a room, wondering why his kids aren't visiting,"" Steele says. ""Parking my career just seemed like the right thing to do."" It is a life-altering decision being faced by more and more people. As the Baby Boomers, one of the biggest generations in U.S. history, advance in age, their adult children are often stepping in to help with caregiving duties ??and that comes with costs. According to a recent study from money managers Fidelity Investments, 62% of caregivers report being occasionally overwhelmed with financial stress. Look at the numbers, and it is not hard to see why: Of those who stepped back from their careers to focus on caregiving - whether for one's kids, or for one's elderly parents - the average time out of the workforce was 20 months, and 53% said the period turned out to be longer than expected. Meanwhile, 37% said they earned less when they returned to work, taking a median 40% pay cut. ""People don't fully understand the toll this takes on other aspects of your life, like your career or your mental health,"" says Meredith Stoddard, Fidelity's vice president of life events planning. ""They go in largely unprepared for the challenges, and are not sure what they're getting into."" Of course, since it is family, it is still a choice that most people would make. Making sure your elderly parents are okay trumps any financial worries, as it did with Steele. Caregivers should be clear-eyed about the sacrifice involved and have a roadmap going in. Some advice from the experts: TRY TO NOT PAY OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET ""Make sure you are maximizing any benefits they are eligible for,"" says Amy Goyer, AARP's family and caregiving expert and author of ""Juggling Life, Work and Caregiving."" That includes veteran's benefits, long-term care insurance and government services. Another aspect is housing. A reverse mortgage, home equity line of credit or utility assistance might help ease the financial burden. Surprisingly, in the Fidelity study, 64% of working caregivers said they didn't even ask their employer if special benefits or flexible options were available. A helpful workbook for all these financial issues for caregivers: ENCOURAGE ALL SIBLINGS TO CHIP IN If one sibling in particular is stepping out of the workforce to care for an elderly parent, the sacrifice involved is significant. Not just the lost income, but unrealized raises and promotions, healthcare coverage, retirement contributions (and future gains on those savings), and more. That is why other siblings should be aware of the full extent of that sacrifice, and help out financially as much as they are able. ""Often the responsibility falls on one of the adult siblings, and it can cause a lot of family conflict,"" says Stoddard. To help understand the full costs of leaving the workforce, Fidelity even put together a calculator: ( PLAN AHEAD ""The worst thing is to be in the middle of a crisis, and to have to figure out how to pay for everything,"" says Goyer, who herself ??even as a caregiving expert -- was driven into bankruptcy by having to care for both parents and her sister. That means things like setting up powers of attorney, for healthcare and finances. It means arranging the estate planning and will situations. It might mean adding your name to their savings or checking accounts, so you can handle their bills if it comes to that. Says Goyer: ""Take care of whatever you can before things are at a crisis point."" As for Lynda Steele, she plans to resume work at a later date ??whether back on the radio, or in something completely new. But in sharing her story publicly, she is amazed at how many others are dealing with the exact same situation. ""If anyone out there is unfamiliar with long-term care, you probably will be at some point in your life,"" Steele says. ""It's gut-wrenching ??and it feels like an ultra-marathon."" Our Standards: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters."
wealth,No inflation fears here: ARK's Wood says portfolio should triple in five years," NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Lower prices for growth stocks as a result of the inflation-driven selloff that began in February should mean that Ark Investment's portfolios should see a ""more than tripling"" over the next five years, star fund manager and firm founder Cathie Wood said in a webinar on Tuesday. Wood, who became the face of the outsized rally in technology stocks such as Zoom Video Communications Inc Lumber prices are down approximately 30% from their May 7 highs, while copper prices are down nearly 6% over the same time. ""We know it's been a difficult time in the market for innovation strategies,"" she said.

The call from Eric Pan, president of the Investment Company Institute, came in response to a The comments marked a shift for the influential trade group after Pan in May urged regulators to adopt only voluntary climate disclosure rules. Asked about the previous remarks, an ICI spokesperson said that after discussions with members, ""our views solidified around mandating certain greenhouse gas emissions and human capital data."" Investors have poured money into funds that base investment decisions on sustainability criteria, in turn prodding big fund firms to support shareholder proposals for corporate reforms. In a letter to the SEC published by ICI on Monday, Pan said the requirements would give fund managers consistent, comparable and reliable data. Pan said that some disclosures should be mandatory, but the trade group hopes the SEC will be flexible about making changes if needed over time.

wealth,JPMorgan freezes donations to Republicans who contested 2020 election," WASHINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co The country's largest lender was among many corporations that paused political giving following the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riots when supporters of former president Donald Trump tried to stop Congress from certifying the election. Just hours later, 147 Republicans, the vast majority of them in the House of Representatives, voted to overturn the Electoral College results which Trump falsely claimed were tainted by fraud. Following a review, JPMorgan will this month resume giving through its Political Action Committee (PAC) but will continue its freeze on donations to a ""handful"" of the 147 lawmakers whom it had previously supported, the bank said. The pause will last through the 2021-2022 election cycle, which includes November's midterm elections, after which JPMorgan will review whether to resume contributions to the lawmakers concerned on an individual basis, it said. ""This was a unique and historic moment when we believe the country needed our elected officials to put aside strongly held differences and demonstrate unity,"" the bank wrote of the Jan. 6 vote to certify Biden's win. Also on Friday, Citigroup said it was resuming PAC contributions but did not specify how it would treat the lawmakers who tried to block Biden taking office. Citigroup said it would evaluate whether to give to all lawmakers case-by-case based on a new set of criteria which includes ""character and integrity"" and ""a commitment to bipartisanship and democratic institutions."" JPMorgan noted that its PAC is an important tool for engaging in the political process in the United States. PACs are political committees organized for the purpose of raising cash to support or in some cases oppose election candidates. ""Democracy, by its nature, requires active participation, compromise, and engaging with people with opposing views. That is why government and business must work together,"" JPMorgan wrote. As part of its revamped spending strategy, the bank will also expand donations beyond lawmakers who oversee financial matters to those active on issues the bank considers ""moral and economic imperatives for our country,"" such as addressing the racial wealth gap, education and criminal justice reform. Since the initial January backlash, corporations have been Other big financial companies that paused donations have slowly resumed spending. Morgan Stanley's PAC While JPMorgan did not name lawmakers in its memo, the bank's new policy risks alienating Republicans with sway over banking policy, some of whom are already angered by its active stance on issues like climate change and racial equity. Of the 147 lawmakers, JPMorgan gave $10,000 each to House finance committee members Blaine Luetkemeyer and Lee Zeldin, and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, among others, during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Representatives for the lawmakers did not respond to requests for comment. All told, JPMorgan's PAC gave nearly $1 million to federal candidates and committees backing candidates during the 2019-2020 election cycle, according to CRP. Of the $600,300 it gave to federal candidates, nearly 60% went to Republicans and the rest to Democrats, according to the CRP data, a mix that is likely to swing further to the left as the bank supports a broader range of social and economic issues. Commercial banks overall have ramped up political spending in recent years, dishing out $14.6 million to federal candidates in the 2020 cycle, the second highest amount since 1990, the data shows. Following the 2008 financial crisis, that mix favored Republicans but in recent years banks have increased spending on Democrats as they look to rebuild bipartisan support in Congress.

wealth,"Analysis: With popcorn and tweets, AMC's Aron rides retail investor wave"," NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Free popcorn for shareholders. Following more than 500 die-hard fans of his company's stock on Twitter. Retweeting a video of what appears to be an airplane flying a banner with the meme-stock rallying cry ""AMC to the Moon"" around Manhattan. Welcome to the world of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc At a time when many on Wall Street argue that the movie theater operator is over-valued and in dire need of an accelerated economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic to justify its share price, Aron, 66, is leaning in to the growing power of individual investors to keep so-called meme stocks surging. ""Watch out naysayers, AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!"" Aron wrote in He has been riding a wave of enthusiasm for the stock. AMC shares are up nearly 3,000% since the start of the year and almost doubled on Wednesday to close at $62.55 a share, way above the average target price of $5.11 among Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv data. AMC is now valued at $28.2 billion, based on Wednesday's closing price. Aron, who became CEO in 2016 after running the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, started promoting AMC after its shares were swept up in a retail buying frenzy in January. AMC did not respond to a request for comment, and Aron did not reply to a direct message on Twitter. Aron is part of a growing number of executives on Wall Street such as Tesla Inc's ""These individual investors likely own a majority of our shares,"" Aron said during the company's May earnings call. ""They own AMC. We work for them. I work for them."" Some analysts are skeptical that such showmanship will bolster AMC's share price long-term. There are no actively managed stock funds among the company's 20 largest shareholders, according to Refinitiv data, leaving open the risk that a shift in retail investor opinion could quickly sink its shares. ""The Twitter horde love him. He's playing to the crowd and it's working,"" said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler, who questioned AMC'S stated strategy of issuing new shares to raise capital. ""He'd be better off improving the balance sheet and providing some stability for the business,"" he said. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that selling enough movie tickets and popcorn to justify a $40 share price for the company - where it was trading early on Wednesday - would require that revenues nearly double from his 2022 estimates of $322,000 per screen from movie tickets and $6 per person in spending on food and drinks. ""It's hard to understand why AMC would perform at double its historical average,"" he said. Aron, whose career includes a decade as chief executive of Vail Resorts Inc and a stint leading Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc, focused more of his attention on connecting with consumers rather than retail shareholders in his previous executive roles. At the 76ers, for instance, he was part of a charge to cut ticket prices, while at Vail Resorts he was instrumental in expanding the company into a nationwide business. Shares of the company fell nearly 4% when he announced his resignation in 2006. Promoting a company's shares to retail investors may be the new reality for many companies, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group.

wealth,Rally in emerging market commodity currencies to roll on," JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Reuters) - Emerging market strategists were cautiously optimistic that the sector's commodity-linked currency rally would continue in coming months, but a much slower pace of vaccine rollouts will keep high-yield seekers nervous, a Reuters poll found on Friday. One-third of 45 strategists in the May 28-June 3 Reuters poll said the rally in commodity-related emerging market currencies would continue for six months while 14 said it would last up to a year. A delicate split emerged among strategists predicting mild long or short EMFX positions in the next six months, with a slight bias to mild strength against the dollar - a sign of cautious optimism. High-yielding currencies like South Africa's rand  and the Mexican peso  have ended four of the last six quarters on a stronger foot, boosted by commodity price rallies and as COVID-19 restrictions dented global trade. The emerging markets currency index However, low-yielders like the Thai baht  are expected to buoy emerging currency markets, with the baht firming 1.3% to 30.81/$. The rouble is also expected to help EM currencies overall to keep gains, seen up 1.5% to 70/$ in 12 months. Analysts said they prefer export-oriented Asia EM currencies like the baht, the Chinese yuan , the Singapore  and Hong Kong dollars  on long positional plays due to firmer bets on sustainable economic growth outlooks. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's David Hauner wrote that he expects a further EMFX rally into the (northern hemisphere) summer on improving growth and still not over-crowded positioning. ""However, we will keep a keen eye on sentiment and positioning indicators to reduce exposure when significant froth appears as it did at the turn of 2020 to 2021,"" added Hauner. Goldman Sachs analysts note some tactical caution in EM currencies was warranted at current levels if some of the favourable tailwinds reverse, with the U.S. 10-year (yield) rates at local lows but equity and commodity markets at local highs. ""Macro valuation metrics are still supportive of EMFX over the medium term, reflationary rate hikes are re-building the carry in EM currencies and a successful EM vaccine rollouts could be key both to a cyclical re-opening across EMs, as well as further strength in EM currencies,"" Goldman Sachs analysts added. Still, vaccine rollouts in emerging market countries have been much slower than in developed nations where health authorities are much closer to reaching inoculation targets and allowing the further opening of economies to trade. South Africa, which only reached its first million inoculations this week, is second from the bottom of 29 countries tracked by Fathom Consulting on Refinitiv Datastream and is 39 million jabs shy of its 60% target. Starkly, the rand's year-to-date 8% gains leads an EM list of 20 currencies tracked by Reuters - despite much slower vaccine rollouts - followed by the Chinese yuan at around 2%. China administered 20.4 million doses on June 1 alone. The high-yielding rand rallied to 13.50/$ on Thursday, trading at its firmest since early February 2019. However, the poll median for the rand is for a correction of around 5% to 14.35/$ in 12 months while the median suggests the yuan will gain over half a percent to 6.35/$ in 12 months. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has a carefully managed floating exchange rate regime and in a warning to speculators this week the PBOC raised its reserve requirements for forex deposits at Chinese banks to rein in a yuan that touched a three-year high against the dollar.

It ""seeks to encourage transformational change at the public companies within its portfolio through the application of proxy voting guidelines,"" the filing said. There are no details in the filing on the fees the fund plans to charge, how much money it may try to raise or when the Securities and Exchange Commission may make a decision on approving the planned new offering. Engine No. 1 was founded late last year with roughly $250 million in assets and made an enormous splash when it announced a $40 million investment in Exxon and plans to force the oil giant to improve its financial performance and focus more on clean energy by adding new directors to the board. Last week, Exxon shareholders elected at least two of Engine No. 1's nominees, with the counting not yet complete. All along, investors expected Engine No. 1 soon to try to raise fresh cash from institutional and retail clients. Planning for the ETF was set in motion long before last week's win, according to previous regulatory filings.

wealth,"After M&A boom via Zoom, dealmakers hit the road as COVID-19 subsides"," May 25 (Reuters) - Investment bankers' business of putting together mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has never been stronger. Neither has their fear of missing out on meeting clients. Bankers are rushing to see company CEOs and other top executives in person as restrictions put in place to contain COVID-19 have eased. This is despite dealmaking through Zoom meetings having flourished, with M&A volumes in the first quarter of 2021 hitting a year-to-date record. The total value of pending and completed deals rose 93% to $1.3 trillion during the quarter, the second-biggest quarter on record, according to Refinitiv data. More than a dozen investment bankers interviewed by Reuters said they were worried they would lose clients if competitors cultivated them in person. Some fretted they could not expand their clientele without schmoozing in the flesh. Some also said they or their staff were fatigued from working long hours remotely. ""People became Zoomed out. I was out visiting clients and they were very appreciative to have us back in front of them,"" said Drew Goldman, global head of investment banking coverage at Deutsche Bank ""The meetings, frankly, were more productive than they would have been on a phone call or on video conference call,"" he said, adding that most clients are also tired of Zoom and happy to meet in person. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this month that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outdoors and can avoid wearing them indoors in most places. Rendezvous points have ranged from offices and restaurants to country clubs and backyards. During negotiations of the megamerger between AT&T's WarnerMedia The pandemic's toll was the heaviest on young bankers who learn their trade and develop contacts by working alongside and traveling with senior colleagues, dealmakers said. The social distancing restrictions made it challenging for them to evolve from footsoldiers to rainmakers, said one junior banker, using a term for those who bring in new clients and revenue. ""For younger bankers who are trying to make their way in the world, they're gonna have to be out there, pressing the flesh and meeting people,"" said Marc Cooper, chief executive of investment bank PJ Solomon. There is no certainty that travel by bankers will reach pre-pandemic levels. While bankers are eager to travel for business development, many are less keen to spend time with clients on more procedural talks that can be carried out remotely and expect a hybrid model will persist.

wealth,Analysis: Blue-collar director vote gives U.S. labor another crack at Amazon.com," May 25 (Reuters) - After a failed union-organizing effort at Amazon.com Inc A resolution from shareholders including nonprofit Oxfam America calls for Amazon to consider nominating an hourly employee to its board. The proposal picked up valuable, and rare, backing from top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. Amazon's board has recommended that shareholders reject the proposal, and very few U.S. companies give workers a board seat. Still the concept is gaining attention as investors focus on income inequality and social justice issues. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a letter to shareholders last month that the company needed ""a better vision for our employees' success."" Bezos controls about 14% of Amazon's shares, making investor-led reforms an uphill battle. During the labor organizing campaign, some staff had aired grievances including fatigue from warehouse work and mandatory anti-union meetings. Still, employees at the Bessemer, Alabama warehouse ultimately rejected forming the company's first U.S. union by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Jennifer Bates, a Bessemer employee who supported the union effort, will present the resolution at Amazon's annual meeting, according to Oxfam. The proposal calls for directors to consider hourly associates in their initial list of new board candidates. Bates is expected to say Amazon has not listened to workers' health and scheduling concerns and that having a board seat would be ""transformative,"" according to prepared remarks shared with Reuters. ""It would send a signal that our voices matter,"" Bates says in the remarks. Amazon referred Reuters to the board's statement against the proposal, which said directors already were focused on employees' pay and benefits and workplace safety and culture. The company raised starting pay to $15 per hour in the United States more than two years ago. ""We have also long recognized the importance of employees' participation in our decision-making processes,"" the board's statement said. ISS SUPPORT MAY MOVE THE NEEDLE For the meeting, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has backed eight other shareholder proposals contrary to the board's wishes and recommended against approving executives' pay, although it did recommend electing all 10 Amazon director candidates. Various countries including Germany have requirements for worker representation in boardrooms, but only a few U.S. companies have such representation including top airlines Delta Air Lines Inc While a number of Democrats in Washington have called for such representation, similar shareholder proposals have drawn little support at other U.S. companies. Proposals at Starbucks Corp A difference is that neither proposal this year had the support of ISS, whose backing can shift 15% or more of shareholder votes, according to corporate election specialists. In its May 13 report ISS noted the controversies Amazon faces over working conditions in its warehouses and stated that ""having employee representation on the board could potentially provide the company with meaningful insights into its workforce's needs."" Shareholder resolutions need not win majorities to lead to changes, since they show boards the mood of investors. Resolutions winning between 30% and 50% support still led to at least some changes two-thirds of the time, a recent study by BlackRock Inc found. The second-largest proxy adviser, Glass Lewis, has recommended investors oppose the director-candidate resolution,  worried it could threaten the board's independence and shareholder value. Courteney Keatinge, Glass Lewis senior director for ESG research who helped develop the recommendation, said the firm would expect Amazon to respond if the proposal wins more than 51%.

wealth,U.S. bank profits rose 29% as outlook for future credit losses adjusted downward," WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits rose 29.1% during the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter as banks adjusted expectations for future credit losses downward, a bank regulator said on Wednesday. The industry posted $76.8 billion in first-quarter profits, up $58.3 billion from a year prior and $17.3 billion in the final quarter of 2020, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said in its quarterly banking profile report. The report data also showed that three-quarters of all banks, or 74.8%, reported higher quarterly net income compared with the year-ago quarter and that the share of unprofitable institutions dropped from 7.4% a year ago to 3.9%. Loan balances declined from the previous quarter and year, driven by a reduction in credit card balances, the agency added. FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams said the new data shows, despite continued challenges, ""the banking industry remains resilient. Strong capital and liquidity levels support lending needs and help protect against potential losses."" The new data also showed deposits grew by $635.2 billion, or 3.6%, from a quarter prior to $18.5 trillion. This lift in U.S. consumers' savings repeats a trend of previous quarters of unprecedented deposit growth, the regulator said. ""We've had record savings rates since the beginning of the pandemic, but this influx of deposits is not permanent,"" an agency official told reporters. ""As the economy continues to expand due to consumers and businesses starting to spend again, we will see a significant moderation in growth,""  another official added, saying that the agency will continue to monitor deposit trends. Total assets increased by $680.9 billion, or 3.1%, from the previous quarter to $22.6 trillion. Cash and balances due from depository institutions expanded by $440.1 billion, or 13.8%, while securities rose a record $366.9 billion, or 7.2%. Three new banks opened and 25 institutions merged in first quarter 2021. No banks failed during the quarter, the FDIC data showed. The number of institutions on the FDIC?�s so-called problem bank list declined by one to 55 from the previous quarter.

wealth,"Wall Street bank CEOs to tout COVID relief push, diversity efforts before Congress"," WASHINGTON, May 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank chiefs will tout the role their institutions have played in getting the pandemic-hit U.S. economy back on track when they appear before Congress this week, but are likely to face tough questions on hot-button social and economic issues. The Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees will hear from the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co In prepared testimony posted on Tuesday, the CEOs highlighted their banks' resilience during the pandemic and their efforts to support struggling clients. They also flagged their work on other priorities, including efforts to address climate change and structural racism. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said climate change is ""one of the defining issues of our time,"" while Citigroup chief Jane Fraser said the banking industry cannot ignore the role it played in the past in contributing to ""systemic inequities."" Wednesday's hearing is the first time the CEOs of the nation's largest banks will have testified before the Senate Banking Committee since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Democratic gains in the 2020 election handed control of that panel to Senator Sherrod Brown, a fierce Wall Street critic. Brown said in an interview on Monday that banks' success steering through the pandemic was not enough. ""They did well, but they did well for themselves,"" he said. ""Every time there's a crisis, banks seem to do better than the rest of the country."" While the hearings are unlikely to result in policy proposals, they are politically risky for the CEOs as scrutiny  of their industry grows in Washington under Democratic leadership. They are likely to be grilled on a raft of issues including economic inequality, fair lending, diversity, racial justice, climate change, cryptocurrencies and tax policies. ""We expect these hearings to be disjointed and nebulous, but they will be must-watch television, nonetheless,"" Isaac Boltansky, a director at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note. The banking industry's image has improved in Washington since the financial crisis more than a decade ago and big banks believe they have a good story to tell after getting $69 billion of COVID-19 aid into the hands of 850,000 struggling small businesses. INDUSTRY WATERSHED Wednesday will mark a watershed for the industry with Citigroup's Fraser, the first female CEO of a Wall Street bank, making her Capitol Hill debut. She will appear alongside Dimon, Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, Well Fargo's Charles Scharf, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon. ""Diversity, equity, inclusion ??these banks have a great story to tell on these issues,"" said Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association. Still, the executives are likely to get heat from some lawmakers, particularly progressives who want them to do more to tackle wealth inequality, racial injustice and climate change. The legislators are also likely to seek answers from the CEOs on evidence flagged by congressional reports that lenders discriminated against some borrowers when distributing pandemic aid, and whether Wall Street's wealthy pay enough taxes. Republicans, on the other hand, are angry at what they see as Wall Street's liberal leanings and will likely criticize the CEOs for trying to drive social policies by curtailing credit for sectors such as gunmakers, private prisons and oil and gas. ""Banks influencing elements of social policy...presents a perilous political dynamic as attempts to placate the left will undoubtedly frustrate their historic allies on the right,"" wrote Boltansky.

The sale is the latest deal in the North Sea marking the handover of assets from oil majors to private companies, which say they can better exploit remaining reserves than huge companies focusing on the energy transition.

wealth,Big banks look for post-pandemic rebound of credit card revenue," May 24 (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks are prepared for credit-card balances to start ticking up again this year as pandemic restrictions ease and stimulus checks stop arriving, setting up the industry for a bump in one of its most profitable businesses. Lenders, including Capital One Banks have increased digital marketing, too, on Facebook, Instagram, video sites and podcasts, he said. ""The big banks are ramping up in anticipation of the recovery post-pandemic,"" Davidson said. ""They are really trying to make up lost ground from last year."" At the same time, lenders have been easing credit standards, according to a recent Federal Reserve survey and public comments by bank executives, including from Bank of America Corp. The change in posture is a stark difference from last year when lenders halted most card offers and pulled back on credit limits, worried that skyrocketing unemployment would create major loan losses. The losses did not happen. Instead, the U.S. government sent out stimulus checks, offered enhanced jobless benefits and propped up small-business owners with forgivable loans. That allowed many credit-card reliant Americans to spend while also paying down balances. Others leaned on higher housing prices to borrow cheaply against their homes rather than use plastic. Altogether that left card businesses in the lurch ??still profitable, but pulling in less revenue. Card balances declined 14% during the pandemic, according to Quarterly financial reports from major card lenders, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Capital One, showcased those trends. But as pandemic lockdowns have started to ease ??the return of indoor dining, travel restrictions lifted, concert announcements, offices reopening and masks coming off ??executives have expressed optimism about consumer spending and borrowing ahead. That is particularly true for rebounding card charges for travel and entertainment, which were down 80% at the beginning of the pandemic, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank told analysts last month. Capital One is encouraging the spending revival by gradually increasing credit limits, he said. ""That represents an extra part of growth opportunity,"" Fairbank said. 'MORE ENTICING' Even as balances fell, the number of card accounts increased during the last two quarters and a decline in credit lines stopped in the March quarter, according to the Fed data. The banks declined to comment on their plans beyond their public statements. What does it all mean for credit-card borrowers? It largely  depends on whether they will be able to maintain enough income to cover their spending when they can go out to dinner and travel again. Any shortfalls would be sweet spots for banks. The average credit-card rate is over 16%, with the highest at 25%, according to CreditCards.com. The APRs have remained high, even as the Fed has kept overnight rates near zero and as most conventional mortgages cost a little above 3%. That helps banks earn twice the return on assets with cards compared with other businesses. Now that the industry has a better feeling about the economy, banks will try to get customers to borrow more on cards, said Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody. ""They do have a good sense of consumer behavior,"" he said. ""They will make it more enticing.""

wealth,EXCLUSIVE China bars banks from selling commodities-linked products to retail buyers -sources," BEIJING, May 26 (Reuters) - China's banking regulator has asked lenders to stop selling  investment products linked to commodities futures to mom-and-pop buyers, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, to curb investment losses amid volatile commodity prices. It has also asked lenders to completely unwind their existing books for these products, which they manufacture and sell to individual investors, said the sources, who are involved in and have been briefed on the decision. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission's (CBIRC's) order to exit these products has not been reported before. It issued the order this year, two of the sources said. ""The risk contained in banks' commodity-linked investments cannot be easily spotted by ordinary investors, neither can they bear it,"" one of the sources said. ""Banks also don't have enough expertise to run such products properly."" The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the directive is not yet public. The CBIRC, China's top banking watchdog, did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking comments. The move comes as runaway commodity prices in both onshore and offshore markets have raised regulatory concerns about the risks of speculative bets, prompting The CBIRC wants to prevent losses like that incurred a year ago by Bank of China (BoC) It has asked lenders, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) The CBIRC has, however, not given a specific deadline to the banks for completely exiting their positions, they added. The ICBC did not immediately reply to a request for comment. While the total size of such products in the Chinese banking system is unknown, BoC's $1.8 billion losses tied to just U.S. crude futures highlights the attractiveness of similar products for retail investors looking for higher returns. FULL SECTOR CLEAN UP Regulators are worried mom-and-pop investors may get burnt again by the recent big swings in commodity prices, driven by post-pandemic demand recovery, liquidity easing and speculative trading. Government watchdogs have urged Chinese industrial metal firms to maintain market order. BoC's losses last year had wiped out several thousands of such small accounts held by retail investors, ranging from college students to retired workers, prompting the CBIRC at the time to ask commercial banks to halt new sales of a wide range of investment products linked to commodity futures. Given the recent price volatility, the ban on new sales has been widened to a full sector clean-up, covering products linked to commodities not specifically targeted before, such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, natural gas and soy beans, the three sources said. Prices of most of these commodities have spiked in recent months, while futures prices for iron ore  and corn  on the Dalian Commodity Exchange as well as steel  and copper  on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have all hit record highs this year. Some banks are considering ways to shift part of their existing commodity-linked investments and clients to affiliated brokerages, but that will need a nod from the securities regulator, one of the sources said. While banks' derivative-like products have flaws in design and risk control, analysts say a harsh sector-wide clean-up means a major setback in China's plans to open up the market. Despite repeated vows to ramp up financial derivatives, Shanghai Futures Exchange has already halted collaboration with banks on the launch of new derivative products in the wake of BoC's losses, two separate sources told Reuters.

wealth,JPMorgan's new CFO described as pensive Excel expert with a knack for mentoring," May 21 (Reuters) - Jeremy Barnum is not the hard-charging, power-hungry type that people often associate with those in the top echelons of Wall Street. Instead, the man who this week became JPMorgan Chase & Co's Barnum, 48, would fit in just as well teaching students in an elbow-patched sweater as presenting JPMorgan's strategy in a tailored suit, several said. ""He struck me as thoughtful, serious, and transparent,??said Boaz Weinstein, a hedge-fund manager who interacted with Barnum in the late 1990s when Barnum worked in JPMorgan?�s credit trading business and the credit derivatives market was in its infancy. ""He was successful in building one of the top desks on the Street."" JPMorgan declined to make Barnum available for an interview. The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described Barnum as an ""extraordinary talent"" known for his ""deep intellect and integrity"" in announcing his elevation on Tuesday as part of a broader executive shuffling. Barnum joined JPMorgan in 1994 and had been leading its global research division since February. Previously, he had been CFO of two business units and a trading executive. Although he is known well in some parts of Wall Street and within JPMorgan, Barnum has made few appearances at conferences or meetings with regulators in Washington and is not the type to be spotted at prominent social events. But behind the scenes, Barnum has been influential within JPMorgan, current and former colleagues said. He is the kind of leader who likes interacting with the most junior employees and getting into the guts of businesses to understand how they operate, they said. He rarely makes an important decision without scrutinizing everything that transpired before an issue reached his desk. It was not rare to see Barnum sitting at a junior staffer's desk, poring through Excel sheets to learn how they came to their conclusions, said Al Moffitt, JPMorgan's head of capital and liquidity management within the treasury department, who previously worked for Barnum. ""In the same morning that he has substantive conversations with the C-suite, he was presenting on Excel spreadsheet tips and tricks,"" Moffit said. In 2005, JPMorgan let Barnum go in a broader restructuring of its credit-trading business, which had a rough prior year. He then headed the London office of hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management before returning to JPMorgan as a trader in 2007. His star rose after JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns the following year, several people said. The bank needed people who understood the risks they were absorbing, and higher-ups took notice of Barnum?�s talents, they said. Barnum later became the ?�go-to person??when JPMorgan was implementing the post-crisis Volcker rule that required banks to prove they were not trading speculatively to earn profits. Dimon once described the rule as something that required a trader, a lawyer and a psychotherapist to implement correctly. ""He knows how to tackle complex issues and breaks them down into simple to-do's,"" said Shahraab Ahmad, chief investment officer at hedge fund Decca Capital, who worked for Barnum after joining the bank as a trainee. Barnum spent time as a youth in Spain, where he learned to speak Spanish fluently. He returned to prep school in New England and attended Harvard University. Some who know him say that banking was not a preordained choice, calling him a ""real intellectual"" and noting he is married to an author and could just as easily have become an academic.

In the week to May 19, $1.1 billion left technology funds, the largest outflow since December 2018. Gold funds attracted $1.3 billion, BofA said.

Sources have also told Reuters that Robinhood will set aside some of its own shares, expected to be floated in a blockbuster debut, for sale on the platform. ""Most IPO shares typically go to institutions or wealthier investors. With IPO Access, everyday investors at Robinhood will have the chance to get in at the IPO price,"" Robinhood said in a blog post. Robinhood will work with Wall Street investment banks to get allocations for retail investors, it said. Robinhood said the new platform will be available to all customers, without any account limit restrictions. It plans to list a number of upcoming IPOs for customers. While Robinhood did not identify specific offerings which would be available, FIGS Inc Several big names, such as grocery delivery app Instacart, Brazilian digital bank Nubank and electric vehicle maker Rivian, are expected to go public later this year. TAKING ON WALL STREET Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been the first in line for allocations on IPOs, as the investment banks that control share allocations find it easier to arrange it when only a handful of recipients are involved and because they need to keep these deep-pocketed clients happy to win other business. That leaves most amateur traders with no option but to buy into stock of a newly listed company only after its shares start trading - which often means paying a higher price. The average first-day trading pop on U.S. listings of businesses in 2020 was 36%, according to data provider Dealogic. Robinhood will gradually roll out IPO Access to all users in the coming weeks. Online lending startup Social Finance (SoFi) also said in March that it would allow retail investors to buy into IPOs. Robinhood's move, if adopted more widely in stock market listings, would be another disruptive step forward for Silicon Valley tech companies that have been attempting to erode the iron grip of Wall Street's biggest institutions on market flotations. The new offering comes months after a Reddit-fuelled retail trading frenzy propped up several so-called ""meme stocks,"" most notably fledgling video game retailer GameStop Inc At the time, Robinhood faced widespread criticism over its decision to place restrictions on trading of the heavily-shorted stocks. Robinhood later said its clearinghouse forced it to place the curbs because it lacked sufficient capital to settle the trades.

wealth,"Slide in cryptocurrencies, other high-fliers, comes amid looming U.S. inflation worries"," NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - A selloff in cryptocurrencies, high-growth stocks and other high-flying assets may be signalling a more cautious outlook among market participants after a stretch of rampant exuberance, investors and analysts said. Few believe the bull run that broader U.S. stock markets have experienced over the past year is set for a reversal. Still, concerns are growing that a looming rise in inflation combined with a potential peak in U.S. economic growth could force investors to cut down on risk in their portfolios, hurting many of the assets that shot higher earlier this year. ""Higher-risk assets, whether in the form ... of cryptocurrencies or the more speculative growth stocks, are seeing their multiples taken down markedly as investors begin to reassess what impact the potential for inflation will have,"" said David Mazza, managing director at Direxion. Wednesday's selloff zeroed in on many of the assets that rallied the most over the last year. Bitcoin dropped to its lowest levels since January Energy stocks in the S&P 500 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, released on Wednesday afternoon, showed that a ""number"" of Fed officials appeared ready to consider changes to monetary policy based on a continued strong economic recovery - a potential negative for risk assets that have thrived from unprecedented stimulus. That meeting, however, took place before the release of April's anemic job data. ""They were thinking about thinking about tapering (quantitative easing) asset purchases if the economy continues on this rapid recovery and they get closer to meeting the dual mandates,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. ""Our view is they probably pre-announce tapering at Jackson Hole in August and they actually start to taper back the asset purchases at the beginning of next year."" Fed officials have pledged to keep their ultra-loose, crisis-fighting policies in place, betting that the unexpected surge in consumer prices last month stems from temporary forces that will ease on their own. ""We think there's still more room to run but that doesn't mean that there wasn't froth in certain parts of the market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist for the Multi-Asset Solutions team at Wells Fargo Asset Management. ""This bull market came out of the gate really quickly and you are bound to get some muscle cramps along the way."" Concerns over inflation - or at least how investors will react to signs of rising consumer prices - have proliferated in recent weeks. Fund managers in a survey from BoFA Global Research released on Tuesday named inflation as the top risk to markets, while BlackRock Inc ?�The recent sell-off in tech shares, despite strong first-quarter earnings, illustrates the potential for hitting air pockets as the economic restart unfolds,??the firm said earlier this week. ?�This may create opportunities in a sector benefiting from structural trends.??Mazza, of Direxion, expects that inflation worries will be short-lived, leaving some of the growth names that have sold off in May more attractive over the next 12 months. The Russell 1000 Value index ""It's very difficult to see a situation where value continues to outperform growth by the same extent through 2022,"" he said.

wealth,Ageing China boosts private sector role as pensions time bomb ticks," BEIJING, May 20 (Reuters) - China is tweaking its $1.2 trillion pension system to increase private sector involvement as its population ages rapidly and underfunding looms, but experts say fundamental changes are needed to provide adequate safety nets. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the country's top banking and insurance regulator, said at the weekend that it is expanding a pilot program of private pensions into two more regions - Chongqing and Zhejiang province. And sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters CBIRC is also considering endorsing a list of private pension funds and appointing a group of professional managers to run them under a new scheme. The change comes days after China showed the extent of its demographic challenges, reporting that citizens aged 65 or older accounted for 13.5% of its 1.4 billion population in 2020, jumping from 8.87% a decade ago. China's pensions problem is grave. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a state think-tank, said in 2019 that state-led coverage will peak at 6.99 trillion yuan ($1.09 trillion) in 2027, and may be exhausted by 2035. That scenario, coupled with the 100 trillion yuan of banking and wealth management savings of its people, is enticing to the  private sector. Foreign pension providers are also But after a tame start, the private pension sector would need higher investment returns and incentives like bigger waivers on capital gains tax to woo the average investor who typically relies on bank deposits and property investment returns to fund their retirement needs, say experts. Another hurdle is China's huge informal sector where millions work without contracts and neither they nor their employers make pension contributions. ""The state-led coverage is facing challenges, and the expansion of corporate contributions to the pension system is limited by informal employment,"" said Dong Keyong, a professor at Tsinghua University, at a forum in Beijing this week. ""A third source, and only the third source (of private pensions), is the way out, and there's an urgency for us to further expand this pilot."" While the government and corporations are the main contributors to pension systems in developed countries, China's corporate contributions and private pensions were equal to 7.3% of its gross domestic product as of end-2018, versus 136% in the United States, according to data provided by Dong. Most Chinese rely on state-led urban pension funds, which require employers to contribute the equivalent of 16% of their staff's basic salaries to the state pension fund each month, a ratio higher than many countries. Former finance minister Lou Jiwei said last year that the state pension on average was only sustaining the retired with less than 50% of the income they earned before retirement, and that ratio was expected to go down further. According to Tsinghua University professor Dong, the portion of citizens aged 65 and above will increase sharply, before stabilising at the ratio of about one-third of the total population. The CBIRC did not immediately reply to a Reuters request on Thursday seeking comment. 'WRONG FOOT' Some local insurance giants, including People's Insurance Company of China China Pacific Insurance Group also sold longer-term products packaged with property investments, which was better received. Appointed insurers in the first private pension investment trial - in Shanghai, neighbouring Suzhou city and Fujian province - only lured some 400 million yuan in purchases over the past three years. That was just a fraction of China's current 8 trillion yuan pension system. It ""started off on the wrong foot,"" said Zheng Bingwen, an expert with CASS, in 2019, citing reasons such as insufficient policy incentives for individuals and sales agents. In the longer term, the CBIRC is looking to boost private pension investments backed by China's 80 trillion yuan of banking deposits and 20 trillion of wealth management products. ""We should study and turn massive individual savings that do not have pension characteristics into long-term, secured, profitable pension products. I believe that's what we need to do, and that we already have the foundation of,"" CBIRC Vice Chairman Xiao Yuanqi told the Boao Forum in April.

wealth,Kentucky securities regulator opens inquiry into Danimer Scientific," BOSTON, May 21 (Reuters) - Kentucky's state securities regulator is investigating plant-based plastics maker Danimer Scientific The Division of Securities of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions told Reuters on Friday that it has ""launched an inquiry into the investor complaint related to Danimer Scientific."" The regulator earlier this week sent a letter to activist short-seller Ben Axler, whose firm Spruce Point Capital conducts forensic financial research, saying it ""has opened a formal inquiry into the matter."" Axler told Reuters he had approached the Kentucky regulator in early May to say Danimer failed to tell investors that it is subject to environmental regulations, which can be costly. Axler also said he told the regulator that Danimer, which has a production facility in Kentucky, revised numbers on air pollutants by 100% in certain months and again failed to alert investors. The Kentucky regulator said it will not comment further on the matter ""until the review is complete."" Danimer, which is headquartered in Georgia, said it will cooperate with any inquiries from the regulator. ""Our company will not be distracted by these hapless attempts to undermine our contributions to solving the global plastic waste crisis. We stand by our disclosures and remain committed to educating and informing investors about our business,"" a Danimer spokesman said. Spruce Point has a short position in Danimer, betting the company's shares will fall. The company, which listed its stock in December after  merging with a so-called blank-check company, quickly became a market darling as investors increasingly focus on environmental, social and governance issues, worrying about, for example, how plastic bottles are clogging rivers and oceans. Danimer's share price surged 145% to a high of $64.29 in its first weeks of trading, as investors hoped its Nodax PHA product, the first PHA polymer verified to fully degrade in the ocean, would become a huge seller. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital  listed Danimer as a top position in its last quarterly letter and index fund giants Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc are also big holders. But over the last three months Danimer's stock price has tumbled 46% as doubts surfaced about Nodax and the company's financial data. Spruce Point said in a report published in April, that ""there are several corporate governance red flags with Danimer's management team that should worry ESG investors."" In that report it said the stock should trade closer to $8.75 a share. It was trading up more than 11% at $22.53 on Friday.

wealth,"EU fines UBS, Nomura, UniCredit $452 mln over bond cartel"," BRUSSELS, May 20 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators fined UBS The penalties are the latest to punish the financial industry for alleged involvement in foreign exchange cartels, Euribor and Libor benchmark cartels, and bonds cartels. The three banks said in statements that they would appeal or were considering doing so. The European Commission said the European government bond cartel ran from 2007 to 2011, with traders from the banks informing each other on their prices and volumes offered in the run-up to the auctions and the prices being shown to their customers or to the market in general via multilateral chatrooms on Bloomberg terminals. ""A well-functioning European government bonds market is paramount both for the eurozone member states issuing these bonds to generate liquidity and the investors buying and trading them,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. UBS said the fine related to ""a legacy issue"" and it had since taken action to improve its processes. ""Taking into account relevant provisions, this matter may have an impact of up to $100 million on UBS's second quarter 2021 results,"" it said. UniCredit said the findings did not show any ""wrongdoing on its part"". ""UniCredit will appeal the decision before the European Courts,"" the Italian bank said in a statement. Nomura said it had introduced measures to ensure ""the highest levels of integrity at all times"" and would consider all options, including an appeal. ""The decision issued today by the European Commission and associated fine imposed on Nomura relates to historic behaviour by two former Nomura employees for an approximate 10 month period in 2011,"" it said. The European Commission said Bank of America NatWest escaped a 260-million-euro fine as it alerted the cartel to the EU competition watchdog. Bank of America and Natixis were also not fined because their infringement falls outside the limitation period for imposition of fines, the Commission said. It said Portigon, the legal and economic successor to WestLB, received a zero fine as it did not generate any net turnover in the last business year.

wealth,Santander to pump up payments business in bid to boost valuation," MADRID, May 20 (Reuters) - Santander Spain's biggest bank is targeting payments as part of a wider strategy to boost its market valuation, with its traditional lending business stymied by low interest rates and technology firms moving in on other areas of financial services. ""In five years there will be ten, maybe fifteen global payment platforms, half of them will be banks and half non-banks, JP Morgan and we (Santander) will be one of them,"" Executive Chairman Ana Botin told Reuters in an interview. Santander grouped its consumer, merchant and trade payments businesses into ""PagoNxt"" in September in an attempt to build a financial technology brand distinct from its banking core. And late last year it bought technology assets of collapsed German firm Wirecard to expand its European payments business. Payments was among the best-performing sectors in financial services last year, McKinsey says, as the coronavirus pandemic turbo-charged the rise of e-commerce. Market data firm Statista expects total transaction value in digital payments to hit $10.52 trillion by 2025 from $6.69 trillion projected in 2021. Frank D'Souza, strategic adviser for Santander's payments business, said he expects PagoNxt's revenue to grow from 360 million euros in 2020 to 1 billion euros in the medium-term. Valuations of payment companies have soared in the last year, with PayPal Botin said growing a successful payments business should help its strategy of boosting its 57.32 billion euro valuation. Santander currently trades with a discount of 30% to its book value or 0.7 times its price to book value, slightly higher than the average of 0.65 times of European banks on the European STOXX 600 index 'UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD' Botin said on a video call that Santander would consider listing PagoNxt but has ""no plans for it right now."" However, the bank's Brazilian unit is planning to list 10% of its payments arm GetNet to help integrate it into the wider PagoNxt business. Botin and D'Souza said PagoNxt plans to keep investing across its trade, merchant and consumer business lines, through staff hiring as well as small acquisitions. But Santander will face an array of competitors as tech firms from Apple and Google to payments specialists PayPal and Stripe get ever larger. Botin says a major hurdle for banks is an ""unlevel playing field"" when it comes to regulatory oversight. Supervision of non-bank financial companies is under scrutiny following the implosion of Wirecard last year and disruptions to trading platforms like Robinhood during times of intense market trading in early 2021. ""All these incidents are showing that there is a systemic risk, there is a consumer impact,"" Botin said. She renewed a call for technology competitors to share customer-generated data with banks, in the same way that banks are required to share data under Europe's ""open banking"" rules. ""We open our data, so everybody should open their data because banking is not what it was, banking is about payments, it is about data,"" Botin said.

wealth,Morgan Stanley CEO shakes up leadership in search for successor," May 20 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley The Wall Street bank named its institutional securities business chief Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein, the head of its wealth management unit, as co-presidents. It also appointed investment management chief Dan Simkowitz as co-head of strategy alongside Pick, and made finance boss Jon Pruzan chief operating officer. ""I am highly confident one of them will be the CEO in the future,"" Gorman said earlier in an interview with Bloomberg. ( Gorman, who joined the bank in 2006 and took over as CEO in 2010, has informed the board of his plans to stay on for at least three more years, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. The fact that all four potential CEO successors are white men drew criticism from some corporate diversity advocates. ""I think the first question to ask is who were considered as candidates"" for these roles, said Charlotte Laurent-Ottomane, executive director at the Thirty Percent Coalition, which encourages diversity in corporate boardrooms. ""Did the candidate pool have diverse people, women and people of color in it? If not, I think the bank probably is not in alignment with the thinking of today."" The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The shake-up comes days after JPMorgan Chase & Co Saperstein runs Morgan Stanley's wealth management business, which Gorman has been trying to build out with moves like the $13 billion purchase of trading platform E*Trade last year to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking. The unit's revenue surged 47% in the first quarter to account for roughly half of the bank's total revenue. Morgan Stanley has also benefited from an unprecedented boom in dealmaking that drove a 66% jump in revenue at its institutional securities unit, which is led by Pick.

wealth,Run Your Race: Money wisdom from Vanguard's Jack Brennan," NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - When it comes to financial advice, you could do worse than listen to someone who helped steer more money than almost anyone else on the planet. When he was chairman and CEO of investment giant Vanguard Group, Jack Brennan oversaw a company that has since grown to over $7 trillion in assets. That torch has since been passed ??first to Bill McNabb, then to current chair and CEO Tim Buckley ??but Brennan still has plenty of wisdom to share in his new book ?�More Straight Talk on Investing,??a follow-up to the 2002 edition. An avid marathoner, Brennan sat down with Reuters to talk about how to pace yourself for the long-distance race of financial security. Q: A lot has happened since you wrote your previous book, so did your advice change at all? A: What has changed for investors in the last 20 years has been very beneficial. The cost of investing has been falling dramatically, which is a critical part of being successful. There have been a lot of great product enhancements, like the ubiquity of ETFs and target-date funds. And the choice of how to get financial advice today is completely different. Everything is lower-cost and more available. Q: Investors since 2000 have gone through so many different types of markets ??how should they navigate all those ups and downs? A: It comes down to simple stuff. Do your homework, be disciplined, be skeptical in avoiding fads, keep learning. Those are four elements I tell people all the time. Q: Many young investors these days are getting market exposure by buying individual stocks on apps ??does that give you pause? A: I worry about it a lot. It?�s like March Madness on TV. I don?�t get it, personally. If you want to speculate on some individual stocks, fine, but your core serious money needs to be in a diversified program. It?�s very hard to beat the stock market. There?�s an old joke that the quickest way to make a small fortune is to start with a large one, and then trade a lot. Q: What advice do you have on avoiding classic investor biases and mistakes? A: We are all subject to emotions when it comes to investing, so there are a couple of things that are very important. One is to tune out all the noise. You shouldn?�t really care about what is happening today, or this month, or even this year. I?�m 66, and I hope I still have a 30-year time horizon. The second thing is that once a year, you should reaffirm what you?�re trying to accomplish. Think about the issue in buckets: Short-term resources, intermediate goals, long-term goals. Once a year, maybe on New Year?�s Day, sit down and look at it all. You don?�t even have to do anything about it, but stay engaged. Q: The market is around all-time highs, so any thoughts on where we stand right now? A: The market is fully valued, in my opinion. I think we will come strongly out of this pandemic, and there are a lot of reasons why equities are still an attractive asset class for most people. You also enjoy the growth of those underlying companies and valuations. If you had told me 11 years ago where the market is now, I might have said watch out, but there are justifiable reasons for it. Q: An extended bear market will come eventually, so how should investors prepare for that? A: It?�s important to understand the role a bear market plays, which is to take all the excess out of valuations. It?�s also a great chance, particularly for younger investors, to put their money to work at lower valuations. Go back and look at any period of time, even investors through the Great Depression, and you see that you will be rewarded over time. Q: In coming years we could see the greatest wealth transfer in human history, so will young investors be able to handle that? A: Boomers may not want to pass on quite yet. But if you do inherit money, you shouldn?�t just take somebody else?�s advice. You need to be a knowledgeable consumer yourself. That?�s the big opportunity for Gen X and Millennials: To be smarter about financial issues than my generation was.

wealth,"No pain, no gain for big funds hunting the next Tesla"," May 19 (Reuters) - Place your bets! The race to find the next Tesla Fidelity Investments, BlackRock Inc In the short-term, there have been some bumps in the road. In just three weeks, from late April to mid-May, the combined value of those 32 companies has slid more than $200 billion to $810 billion, according to data compiled by Reuters and investor website Pitchbook, with Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, accounting for three-quarters of the drop.  The steep slide in the EV sector is, for some market observers, a natural progression from the sky-high valuations being doled out in a crowded market to companies, which in some cases have no revenues or even products to sell. ""You are going to see some roadkill,"" said Evangelos Simoudis, venture investor and author of ?�Transportation Transformation?? Of the 32 companies analysed by Reuters, 17 are doing or have done reverse mergers via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) often referred to as blank-check companies. Of the remaining 15, six are private with the rest publicly listed. Of the four big fund managers, T. Rowe Price has not invested in any of the EV-related SPACs.  The market drop is particularly prevalent among those startups that have gone public through reverse mergers. From late April to mid-May, the market cap of Lordstown Motors During the same period, Tesla's value declined 23%. Reuters could not quantify the overall impact of the recent slide in electric vehicle company valuations on the individual asset managers as some of the investments are private and it is unclear how much each firm has invested in each. BlackRock has invested in 22 of the 32 companies, Fidelity in 19, Baillie Gifford in eight and T. Rowe Price in four. The risk to mom-and-pop investors in mutual funds is somewhat limited, because portfolio managers typically spread their bets across more than 100 companies in a wide array of sectors. The big houses also parcel out their key investments across a number of their funds. Fidelity, for instance, distributes its Tesla investments to more than 100 of its mutual funds. ""We are looking for companies that are going to compound (in value) over time,"" said Elliot Mattingly, Fidelity's chief auto analyst and portfolio manager of the Fidelity Select Automotive Portfolio Mattingly?�s $191 million fund has posted a 102% total return over the past year. The fund?�s top holding, though, is auto veteran Toyota ROULETTE WHEEL With traditional stock-picking funds losing business to cheaper index-tracking players, there is pressure to find stocks that will juice returns. ""These big investors, they're like, 'You know what, I'm going to bet on red, black.' They basically take out one quarter of the roulette wheel and they start putting money around and then they refine it,"" said Tony Aquila, chief executive of and an early investor in EV startup Canoo ""It's no different than a sophisticated bettor in Vegas."" An investment from a major fund firm is a huge endorsement for startups with no track record, and executives in the electric vehicle industry say such funds are accelerating the shift from fossil-fueled transportation. ""In categories where you have high innovation and it's an arms race, like with EVs, the BlackRocks and Fidelities are playing a very important role (in) stimulating innovation,"" said Aquila. A new route for institutional investors, which have seen both traditional investment opportunities and returns dwindle as the number of public companies has shrunk, is the PIPE, or private investment in public equities (PIPE). Backers of so-called SPACs or blank-check companies -- listed shell companies that raise money to acquire private businesses -- started offering private investments to big investors, typically at a discount, last year as a way to get them into startups ahead of their public offerings. Buying into a company via a SPAC can be riskier because SPACs have greater latitude than companies doing a traditional IPO to make growth projections that may not materialise. The Reuters analysis of investment data compiled by PitchBook shows a cadre of 17 EV-related startups has raised more than $9 billion in private investments backed by one or more of the big asset managers. BlackRock declined to comment for this story but it has been vocal about the transition to a more sustainable world presenting ""a historic investment opportunity."" LONG-TERM PLAYS The PIPE route isn't universally popular. Baltimore-based T.Rowe Price has steered clear of offers from blank-check sponsors in the EV space, preferring instead to invest in companies with a path to going public within two to three years, giving it time to get acquainted with their strategies and have some influence on their boards. ""We don't like to spray and pray,"" said Joe Fath, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund. ""Some investors spread bullets in a lot of different places. We do deep industry and company-specific research (and) selectively bet on firms that we think will be durable winners."" Fath is a board observer at Rivian where T. Rowe Price has led the last three private investment rounds. Rivian's valuation continues to climb ??from about $6 billion in early 2019 to an estimated $27.6 billion after the most recent raise in January 2021. Baillie Gifford, a 113-year-old fund firm whose early bet on Tesla has helped it outflank peers, is active as a pre- and post-IPO investor in several well-known EV makers. It has also participated in private placements connected with aerial vehicle startups Joby and German rival Lilium. The firm, with around $450 billion in assets under management, has a strategy of investing in companies that it expects to grow dramatically. The firm's investment in Chinese EV and battery maker BYD Investment manager Brian Lum said the firm's focus was on long-term performance. ?�We typically hold things for five years, 10 years or even longer,??said Lum. ?�EV dominance is almost inevitable.??Our Standards: Investment in renewable energy needs to triple by the end of the decade if the world hopes to effectively fight climate change and keep volatile energy markets under control, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday."

wealth,Advisory firm Glass Lewis backs two dissident nominees in Exxon battle," May 17 (Reuters) - Advisory firm Glass Lewis recommended on Monday that Exxon Mobil Tiny activist fund Engine No. 1 has taken aim at Exxon's board and its future direction in the first major shareholder contest to make climate change a top issue. The fund has criticized Exxon for poor financial returns and a lagging approach to the transition to lower-carbon energy. Glass Lewis recommended votes for former AndeavorChief Executive Gregory Goff and Alexander Karsner, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy for efficiency and renewable energy. It is the third proxy advisor to support part or all of Engine No. 1's slate. ""Electing even a portion of Engine 1's slate would send a clear message of shareholder dissatisfaction with Exxon's recent direction and strategy,"" Glass Lewis said in its report. It also said Exxon had underperformed peers and its energy transition plan was ""generally insufficient and lacking in key areas."" Exxon and Engine No. 1 could not be immediately reached for comment. Exxon had a historic loss in 2020 but shares are up more than 40% this year. In addition to backing Goff and Karsner from the activist slate, Glass Lewis recommends votes in favor of eight current Exxon directors including CEO Darren Woods. By choosing Engine No. 1's proxy card instead of the company's, Glass Lewis' recommendation leaves out current Exxon directors including former MetLife CEO Steven Kandarian, former Caterpillar CEO Douglas Oberhelman, former IBM CEO Samuel Palmisano and former Petronas CEO Wan Zulkiflee. The 12 nominees with the most votes will win board seats.

wealth,Julius Baer confirms targets as AuM grow 8% through April," ZURICH, May 19 (Reuters) - Julius Baer ""The increase was driven by continued net new money inflows (4% annualised), positive stock market performance, and the softening of the Swiss franc ??particularly against the US dollar, euro, and British pound,"" Switzerland's third-largest listed lender said in a statement on Wednesday. Wealth managers saw a boon from increased client activity amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, benefiting from high transactions levels and amassing fewer loan loss risks than high street peers. Baer, meanwhile, has been increasing its focus on the ultra-wealthy under Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher, who assumed the role in late 2019, and trimming costs. That helped the group achieve an adjusted cost/income ratio of around 60% through April, an improvement from 66% in the second half of 2020 and far ahead of the target it had previously set for 67% by 2022. The Zurich-based lender, which did not provide profit and revenue figures in its four-month interim statement, also reported an improvement in gross margin to 90 basis points, up from 84 basis points in the final six months of 2020. The bank in February posted a 50% rise in 2020 net profit, as booming markets and strong client trading helped it overshoot its mid-term targets. But analysts had expected low and negative interest rates to weigh on the group this year, while they also anticipated a slowdown from frenzied activity levels. Baer on Wednesday said client activity levels had remained elevated throughout the first quarter, but slowed to ""more subdued levels"" in April.

Hours after the shares were suspended, Siemens Energy wrote in a letter to the Spanish regulator that it regularly reviewed its entire portfolio and that this included its stake in Siemens Gamesa. ""While we can of course not exclude any scenario in the future, we can confirm that SIEAG (Siemens Energy) is currently not working on a takeover bid in relation to SGRE (Siemens Gamesa),"" the letter said, adding none of the mentioned banks had been mandated. At current market valuations, the 33% share in Siemens Gamesa that Siemens Energy does not already own is worth around 5.7 billion euros ($6.96 billion). Analysts at Citi, in a note triggered by the newspaper report, said they would prefer Siemens Energy to cut its stake to just above 50% to free up cash for growth, including in hydrogen. Shares in Siemens Energy retreated after gaining as much as 4% on the news, while Siemens Gamesa's stock rose more than 3.5% after the suspension was lifted.

wealth,"Analysis: U.S. investors looking for protection as inflation pressures bubble, stocks volatile"," NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. investors grappling with the latest stock volatility and evidence of inflation say they have been positioning themselves for more unexpected kinks in the road to recovery. The moves to hold assets that could withstand a prolonged surge in inflation come as data earlier in the week showed Another wrinkle for investors trying to navigate the economic reopening is the Federal Reserve, which expects a jump in inflation to be ""transitory,"" meaning it will be slower to raise interest rates in order to make up for persistently low inflation over the last decade. ""What we've learned in the past 24 hours is that the amplitude of inflation is going to be more important than anyone realized and it's too soon to tell how persistent it will be,"" Bob Miller, head of Americas Fundamental Fixed Income at BlackRock, said on Thursday. ""That will be the debate over the summer."" Miller, who said his firm is holding more cash than it normally would, expects that the combination of the Fed's policy and signs that inflation may be rising more above expectations ""is going to create more financial market instability over the next summer and fall if not dialed back."" There has been evidence of more cautious behavior in recent weeks. Investors moved $57.3 billion into cash during the last week of April, the largest inflow to cash since March 2020, and followed that with the largest weekly inflow into gold in three months during the first week of May, according to Bank of America Global Research. ""The inflation bump that we expected will be higher and bumpier than we expected,"" said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, who has been increasing his weighting in small-cap equities and is moving into emerging markets stocks in anticipation that the reflation trade extends throughout the remainder of the year. ""We are not dealing with runaway inflation, but we're dealing with the fact that everyone has a different definition of what transitory means,"" he said. TRANSITORY TROUBLES Inflation fears have weighed on equities this week, particularly growth stocks. Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 ""I think every portfolio manager, every growth equity manager out there, is trying to figure out ... are we getting close to the bottom, are we going to retrace another 25%? It's why you see the market churning back and forth,"" said Brad Gerstner of hedge fund Altimeter Capital at the Sohn conference on Wednesday. Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, said the reopening of the global economy will most likely take longer than many investors expect, leaving the market's recent rotation into cyclical shares with a ""considerable runway,"" he said. The Russell 1000 Value index Some investors concerned about inflation are favoring Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, and yields on 10-year TIPS are close to a three-month low. Benchmark 10-year yields , meanwhile, have steadied after rising over the first three months of the year. ""The recent preference for TIPS is an acknowledgement that inflation could potentially pick up and if it picks up it might persist for a longer period of time than what the market or the Fed is expecting,"" said Jim Besaw, chief investment officer at GenTrust Wealth Management, which has been increasing positions in commodities and regional banks in anticipation of a long period of higher inflation. Not every prominent fund manager is as concerned. Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund last year, said in a webinar on Tuesday that continued innovation will make deflation a larger force than inflation in the years ahead. Indeed, the inflation picture is difficult to read. ?�It?�s kind of hard to ascertain what?�s truly happening,??said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy for PGIM Fixed Income. ?�You have so many supply line disruptions, you have data quirks, you have labor disruptions.??Our Standards: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters."

wealth,Column: Soaring retirement healthcare price tag calls for some careful planning," CHICAGO, May 13 (Reuters) - How much will healthcare cost you in retirement? Your mileage will vary - but this much is clear: the forecast is getting more intimidating. A new report from Fidelity Investments estimates that the cost of healthcare throughout retirement for a 65-year-old opposite-gender couple retiring this year is $300,000, some 30% higher than it was a decade ago. The report relies on longevity projections by the Society of Actuaries, which currently forecasts that men will live to 87, and women to age 89. A dollar figure like this can freeze you in your tracks. It is so large you might prefer not to even think about it. ?�It can create an ostrich-in-the-sand response,??said Hope Manion, senior vice president, Fidelity Workplace Consulting, adding it could prompt people to think, ""I?�ll never be able to save that much, so I won?�t even try."" But retirees do not need all that money at the start of retirement, because in fact they will spend it across a retirement of 20 or more years. And to a great extent, these expenses can be managed very well, as they are predictable, and a good chunk will be covered by Medicare. Eighty percent of the dollars in Fidelity?�s forecast will be spent on Medicare Part B and D premiums and the program?�s cost-sharing provisions, including co-payments, coinsurance and deductibles. These expenses can be funded with savings, or income from Social Security or pensions. The Part B premium is deducted from Social Security benefits in most cases. Your Medicare enrollment choices will determine the balance between premiums and other out-of-pocket spending. The big decision when you enroll is between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, the commercially offered managed care alternative to Original Medicare. Everyone pays the Part B premium ($148.50 this year). Original Medicare beneficiaries without supplemental coverage are subject to a deductible of $1,484 for inpatient hospitalization plus daily copayments for extended hospital and skilled nursing facility stays. There is also a separate deductible of $203 plus 20% coinsurance for most physician and other outpatient services, including for drugs administered by physicians for cancer and other serious medical conditions. Most Original Medicare enrollees typically have some form of out-of-pocket cost protection - either a Medigap plan, coverage from a former employer or union or Medicaid. But a Medicare Advantage enrollees pay less upfront in premiums. Many plans come with prescription drug coverage wrapped in at no extra cost aside from the Part B premium, and all come with a built-in out-of-pocket cap - so Medigap plans are not used alongside them. But costs can jump if you become ill and use a lot of healthcare services in any given year. In 2020, And enrollees in Original Medicare have far greater choice - they can visit any healthcare provider that participates in the program, and most do. Advantage enrollees face the usual managed-care restrictions and hassles with prior authorization requirements and denials of care. WILD CARDS: EARLY RETIREMENT, LONGEVITY Medicare choices aside, a couple of other variables will affect your lifetime cost. Right now, early retirement due to COVID-19 is a major factor. These early retirees will lose the benefit of employer-sponsored health insurance before they qualify for Medicare, boosting their lifetime healthcare costs. The other big variable is your longevity - and not in the way you might think. Women tend to live longer, so they actually tend to incur higher lifetime healthcare costs than people who die younger. This is reflected in the Fidelity data - among single retirees, the 2021 health cost estimate is $157,000 for women and $143,000 for men. But the big takeaway from these lifetime spending forecasts is that healthcare will be one of the basics you must plan to cover in retirement. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) offer a way to build a saving reserve for these costs. These tax-advantaged accounts are available to people enrolled in high-deductible health insurance plans, and they can be used to meet current deductible and other out-of-pocket healthcare costs  (Details on how these plans work  can be found Most employers offset the high deductible with an annual cash contribution to the account. At Fidelity, for example, 78%  percent of HSA employer clients make contributions to employee accounts, averaging $935 per year. But if you have the means to meet some or all of these expenses from other resources, the HSA can be a vehicle for socking away money for healthcare in retirement. ?�You just want to make sure that something is earmarked in the financial plan for it,??said Fidelity's Manion.

wealth,New generation of digital banks bets on minority markets," NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - After a doctor's visit, three court appearances, five trips to the bank and having her name and address published in a newspaper, Billie Simmons finally got a debit card with her chosen name. As a transgender woman, that meant she didn't run the risk of outing herself every time she used her card for routine expenses like buying groceries. The legal process to change her name and her gender on identity documents took several weeks. Yet four years on, Simmons still receives her monthly credit report in an email addressed to her dead name. She hasn't been able to change her online banking username and her credit score is incomplete, only reflecting transactions made after she legally changed her name. ""It's a constant emotional reminder that the system will always see me as the person I used to be and it won't let me move on with my life,"" the 27-year-old said. ""On tough days that's a really hard thing to grapple with. These banking systems are not designed for us."" Hoping to address some of these issues, Simmons has co-founded Daylight, an online banking provider focused on the LGBTQ community that is set to launch this summer. Among its features, it allows users to set up an account online with their chosen name, regardless of what appears on their ID documents, and receive financial coaching focused on goals common among many LGBTQ consumers, such as saving for surrogacy or adoption. Daylight estimates there are 30 million Americans who identify as LGBTQ. It is among a cohort of new digital banks in the United States targeting communities where many people say their needs have not been met by mainstream lenders. Such startups include First Boulevard and Greenwood, both focused on serving Black Americans, Cheese Financial aimed at the Asian community and Majority serving immigrant groups. ""Historically, community banks have focused on cheaper customer acquisition by focusing on an underserved geography,"" said Ian Kar, founder and CEO of research firm Fintech Today. ""The internet removes geographical restrictions. Developing banking services around people's identity, like race and sexual orientation, is a modern approach."" Digital banking startups that target specific demographics raised a collective $318 million from investors in 2020, according to data provider CB Insights. They've raised $86 million in eight deals in 2021, including a $40 million cash injection for Greenwood from U.S. financial institutions including Truist Financial Corp Yet such startups are entering an increasingly crowded market for digital banking, where many rivals offer similar basic services and pricing, like no monthly fees, overdraft fees or minimum balance. They're betting their branding and tailored offerings for their target groups will trump the wider range of services offered by big banks. Yet they may need to swiftly expand their customer bases to challenge larger lenders who enjoy scale and cheaper sources of capital, according to some industry experts. YAWNING WEALTH GAP Kansas City-based First Boulevard, founded in the wake of George Floyd's murder last year, says it aims to help customers build wealth and reinvest in the Black community. The inequality in the United States is stark: the average wealth of Black families is $24,100 - less than 15% that of white families, at $142,500, according to Federal Reserve data. Just 6% of Black business owners surveyed in 2020 by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity said their primary source of credit came from banks, versus 23% for all businesses. When approved, the median loan amount for Black business owners was less than half of the loan amounts extended to white peers, according to the survey. ""We are one of the only communities in the world that were considered property when our financial system was built,"" said Donald Hawkins, First Boulevard's CEO. Among its offerings, First Boulevard is building a marketplace which gives users cash back for buying at Black-owned businesses. Prentiss Earl, a teacher and entrepreneur in Kansas City, said he'd never felt comfortable asking his mainstream bank for financial advice, but would at a lender like First Boulevard. ""I want to feel I sense that my money is going to business ventures and people who look like me,"" Earl said. First Boulevard is launching on Juneteenth - an annual holiday on June 19 commemorating the abolition of slavery in the United States - and says it has a waiting list of 200,000 users. It recently raised $5 million in seed funding from backers including UK banking giant Barclays Plc ""If you see more attention to this segment it is because it has been lacking for so long,"" said Amy Nauiokas, founder and CEO of Anthemis, referring to minority groups. 'IT'S INTIMIDATING' Given the challenges facing such entrants into the competitive digital banking market, success could hinge on how quickly they can grow their customer base by building a brand that resonates as authentic with the communities they aim to serve, according to analysts. ""You could make a mistake very easily as you will never appeal to every single person in that community. It's a community but not everyone is a carbon copy,""  said Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS. Houston and Stockholm-based Majority provides banking services to immigrants in the United States, a diverse group spanning multiple nationalities, cultures and languages, and says it signed up 5,000 subscribers in its first 3 months since launching. The company began by offering financial services to the Nigerian community in Houston, later expanding to Cubans in Miami. It now plans to target immigrants from Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia in Washington DC. It hires employees from the same communities who can act as local advisers. CEO Magnus Larsson said many migrants go to physical stores in their communities to access basic financial services. ""Why do people go there when it's expensive? Because of the cultural context,"" he added. ""They are uncomfortable or not feeling welcome (in mainstream banking). It's intimidating."" FINANCIAL ACCESS For some people, specialized banks can be crucial, according to Ken Lian, who lacked a credit profile and struggled to open a checking account after he moved to the United States from China in 2008. He ended up paying more than $1,000 in various fees like ATM withdrawals and overdrafts. He now has a 800 FICO credit score, which is considered above average, but says he can still get rejected by mainstream banks because of his relatively new status in the country. This year Lian co-founded Cheese Financial, a digital banking service for the 21 million Asian Americans. Tailored to be accessible for customers with no credit history, the company is also working on being able to take on new customers without requiring a social security number. It offers 10% cash back at more than 10,000 stores and Asian-owned businesses and has pledged to donate $10 for each new user to a non-profit organization focused on helping the community. ""Given the current environment the Asian community is facing, we built Cheese as a new banking platform with a social cause,"" Lian said, referring in part to a spike in attacks on Asian Americans over the past year.

wealth,Americans' top financial regret? Not saving for an emergency," NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Regrets, we've had a few. Or when it comes to our money, a whole lot. In fact, more than 80% of Americans have financial regrets, according to a new survey by personal finance site Bankrate.com. And because of the pandemic era, those regrets are a little different than they used to be. ""Normally, the top regret is not saving for retirement early enough,"" says Greg McBride, Bankrate?�s chief financial analyst. ""This year, that flip-flopped: It was not saving enough for an emergency."" That stands to reason, since this whole year has seemed like one big emergency, with an enduring health crisis and millions of job losses. In the survey conducted this April, 20% of respondents listed a lack of emergency savings as their top regret, compared to 15% two years ago. That was not the only financial remorse: Not saving enough for retirement was a close second at 19%, followed by racking up too much credit-card debt, at 18%. Only 15% said they had no regrets whatsoever. You may have your own missteps to add to the list: Perhaps not investing in Amazon or Apple years ago, or putting too much in some hot stock tip that did not pan out. Perhaps not buying a home, or buying an expensive on a house that you could not afford. Perhaps taking on too much student debt that you just have not been able to shake. START INVESTING SOONER Every money regret stems from your personal story -- but whichever one you have, a financial planner has probably heard it already. ""The biggest regret I hear over and over is that they didn?�t start investing sooner,"" says Matt Stephens, an advisor with AdvicePoint in Wilmington, N.C. ""Other financial regrets I hear about are buying a car that was too expensive, selling stocks in a downturn, and buying real estate in 2006. I?�m always surprised by the consistency of the regrets."" And they are certainly numerous. When we posed this question recently on social media, the responses were immediate and plentiful: ""Stupid timeshare."" ""Not buying real estate in San Francisco in the late '90s, or New York City after 9/11."" ""Not investing in Bitcoin when it was .50."" ""Loading up credit-card debt as a young single mother."" ""Not fully funding my 401(k) in my younger years."" Financial regret may feel like a highly personal issue, but there is a whole field of study about what we regret and why. There are two ways to look at it: Regretting the stuff you did do, and the stuff you did not do. Either way, those regrets tend to shape how you handle financial issues in future. And not necessarily in a productive way, in terms of lessons learned. Regret can actually be a major threat to your financial security, according to the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman. Because of its powerful emotional component, regret ??and related issues like loss avoidance -- can lead you into making decisions you probably should not be making. ""Regret theory suggests investors who sell at the wrong time and miss out on gains experience regret that affects their judgment, leading to subsequent market-timing mistakes,"" says Sarah Newcomb, behavioral economist for research firm Morningstar and author of the book ""Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead Without Leaving Your Values Behind."" ""The idea that regret over one financial mistake can lead to subsequent mistakes is an important one. Emotions are important to consider when making a decision, but they can easily sway us if we over-weigh their importance in our mental calculus."" Of course, regrets can look very different at different stages of life. That is why the new Bankrate survey is heavily split along generational lines: It is credit-card debt that looms most ominously over the psyches of younger Millennials, at 30% of respondents, while that regret eventually recedes for older generations. Meanwhile, not saving early enough for retirement is the clear winner for Baby Boomers, at 33%. In that way, considering the financial regrets of older Americans is like getting an advance peek into the future ??a glimpse that could spur younger generations to make better money decisions right now. ""Older age cohorts are worried that they have not saved enough, and that was especially evident in the numbers this year,"" says Bankrate's McBride. ""That concern has really rattled them.""

wealth,Bankers quit London as Brexit relocations to EU step up," LONDON/PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - Investment banks are shifting more rainmakers out of London to financial centres across the European Union, accelerating the pace of moves after the pandemic and uncertainty over Britain?�s access to the bloc slowed relocations. Morgan Stanley The lack of a breakthrough in talks for a meaningful deal between Brussels and London on financial services post-Brexit has added to the impetus. Client-facing bankers in London are required a ""chaperone"" based inside the bloc whenever they speak to clients, spurring some to relocate to avoid that complication when sealing deals. Lifestyle choices are also playing their part, with traders and other senior staff moving too. Working from home during the pandemic enabled some bankers to leave London for warmer continental climes, mirroring a shift by Wall Street executives to Miami during the height of the COVID outbreak in New York. Some European bankers are now looking at making the shift permanent. ""There is Brexit but not only, there is a post-Covid phenomenon too,"" said Emmanuel Goldstein, Morgan Stanley's France chief executive, explaining that some French bankers were returning home having spent their entire careers overseas. Morgan Stanley will add 50 staff to its 150-strong Paris office by end-2021 and plans to double in size by 2024 through a mix of relocations and local hiring as it expands its central Parisian hub, Goldstein said. Barclays' head of M&A for Europe and the Middle East, Pier Luigi Colizzi, has recently moved to Milan and will run the region's deals team from there, two sources familiar with the lender said, making him one of the few regional M&A heads based outside of London. The bank has also beefed up its offices in Paris and Frankfurt with local hires, poaching senior M&A bankers from BNP Paribas and Greenhill & Co. Goldman Sachs' head of European corporate and sovereign derivatives, Alessandro Dusi, has moved to Milan, where overall headcount has swelled to about 60 from 20 in 2017, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its Madrid office, Goldman now has 60 staff, double pre-Brexit levels, a second source close to the bank said. Barclays and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Predictions of an exodus of tens of thousands from London after the 2016 Brexit referendum have not yet materialised -- consultancy EY calculates that 7,600 Brexit-related financial services jobs had left London up until March, a fraction of London's half-a-million financial workforce. But bankers and analysts say many of the moves are still to happen. JPMorgan Financial lobby group Paris Europlace in 2016 predicted Brexit would create 10,000 new finance jobs in Paris by 2025. To date, fewer than half of those jobs have materialised but it's sticking with its forecast. Up to 35,000 London financial jobs could eventually disappear, said William Wright of think tank New Financial. The European Central Bank's bank supervisor, Andrea Enria, this month said that he understood the pandemic had slowed down relocations and the ECB's objective was not ""to put people in chains and move them to Frankfurt"". But he stressed banks need to ensure people in charge of interactions with European clients and managing risk are inside the bloc. ""There are banks that have done the 'full monty' and are already there and we're fully satisfied and there are banks that have done much less,"" he said. PARIS AHEAD Expectations Frankfurt would emerge the biggest beneficiary of 7,600 Brexit job moves to date have been confounded, with Paris attracting the most people, according to EY, which estimates 2,800 jobs have gone to Paris. Bank of America, for example, has 400-odd staff in the French capital. Other cities including Milan, Madrid and Amsterdam are also luring senior figures as banks give employees more leeway about where to work. The Bank of France's banking supervisory arm, ACPR, said by December 2020, 50 financial firms from Britain had obtained authorisation in Paris, representing almost 2,500 jobs transferred to the French capital, along with at least 170 billion euros in assets. ""We are seeing an acceleration of jobs in investment banking and trading activities after a slowdown due to COVID,"" said Arnaud de Bresson, Paris Europlace's managing director, adding that bankers had chosen Paris because of its proximity to London, the lifestyle and its ""capital markets culture."" Morgan Stanley's Goldstein said there was ""a new found attractiveness"" for working in France today, pointing to a more pro-business climate under President Emmanuel Macron. According to estimates from the city of Frankfurt, it expects 2,000 new Brexit-related jobs created by end-2022, up from the 1,500 new jobs created in Frankfurt by end-2019. A senior banker at UBS said some employees had relocated to Italy or the Netherlands rather than Frankfurt for personal reasons, and the city's bland image and relatively small size didn't help. ""We have to do more to promote it,"" the banker said. Bankers say they have struggled to find sufficient skilled staff in Frankfurt and that German regulators' inexperience versus French supervisors in overseeing several major investment banks had frustrated some American banks in particular. Still, Frankfurt offices are expanding hiring too. Andreas Halin, founder of Global Mind Executive Search Consultants, said senior bankers had realised they ""cannot hide behind COVID"" and were under regulatory pressure to expand Frankfurt headcount. While Paris is ahead for staffing numbers, no city has emerged a single EU capital markets hub. Germany is the preferred destination for EU legal bank entities, while Paris has won trading-related divisions. Amsterdam has gained much of the stock and swap trading departing London, as well as trading platforms, but few new jobs. New York has meanwhile emerged the global winner in derivatives, winning a bigger volume of the interest rate swap trading leaving London than the EU.

wealth,Analysis: What happened when a U.S. state required details on corporate diversity," May 11 (Reuters) - Aerospace company Boeing Co Illinois officials have seen the range of responses from local companies - many with international profiles - to new state requirements they identify the gender and race or ethnicity of each board member. The regulators say they are going to push all to be more like Boeing. Companies, investors and elected officials will watch closely what happens next with the state's rare requirement for director-by-director declarations. Other say less specific disclosures protect directors??privacy, but even those plans face opposition. Some Republicans have called for regulators to reject a Nasdaq Inc State Representative Chris Welch, speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, proposed what became the 2019 Illinois law on board diversity reporting. ""You can't go wrong with more data,"" said Welch, who is Black. Corporate America's white-dominated leadership has been under a spotlight for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement while listing few leaders of color.  Activists point to some studies suggesting companies with diverse boards perform better. Chicago-based Morningstar Inc ""Putting sunlight on areas that lacked it has rarely had a poor outcome for investors,"" added Kapoor, who is Indian American and identified as Asian in a corporate filing last year. Companies face no penalty if they do not fully report but may comply to avoid criticism by people scrutinizing the information, which began appearing on the Secretary of State?�s website last year. Last month Illinois officials tweaked a disclosure form to make more explicit the call for companies to list the self-identified race or ethnicity of each director, and gender. A spokeswoman for ADM - which in 2020 gave the 55% figure and noted five of its 11 directors were African American, Asian or Hispanic, and that three were women - told Reuters the company will consider reporting further detail next year. It has since added a director and says that half its 12-person board is now African American, Asian or Hispanic. Sixty-six of the 74 companies that filed forms since the law was passed provided enough information to parse out their racial diversity, University of Illinois professor Richard Benton said  in a But even among companies with incomplete filings there seemed to be little resistance to the disclosures. For instance at U.S. Cellular Corp Phyllis Lockett, a director at exchange operator CME Group Inc Ekta Singh-Bushell, who described herself as Indian American and is identified as Asian in a filing from Huron Consulting Group ?�To bring about sustainable and real, lasting change, the conversation should be, 'Do we have the right representation to fulfill our highest purpose as a corporation?'??she asked. Among the S&P 500, 9% of directors were Black as of January, according to researcher Equilar, up from 8% in August. Hispanics were 4.2% of S&P 500 directors, up from 3.6% in August. Asian or Pacific Islander directors accounted for 4.5%, up from 4.4% in August. African Americans were 13.4% and Hispanics 18.5% of the U.S. population, as of 2019. Asians were 5.9%. Women, 51% of the U.S population, held 23.5% of board seats at Russell 3000 companies last year, up from 18.5% in 2018, Equilar found. Illinois State Senator Jacqueline Collins, an African American who co-sponsored the legislation, said that without name-by-name disclosures, it can be hard to determine whether companies are being frank when they declare they are diverse. ""So we want to know the specific participation,??Collins said. Other plans do not go as far. Stock exchange operator Nasdaq Inc ""We don't actually care about which person is which. We want to understand the boardroom as a whole,??said Wendy Cromwell, vice chair of the $1.1 trillion Boston money manager Wellington Management. It supports the Nasdaq plan especially for having companies provide diversity information in easily compared tables. But Joe Shoen, the CEO of U-Haul?�s parent company, Nasdaq-listed Amerco ""As soon as you sort people by skin color, you got my back up,"" Shoen, who described his family as interracial, said in an interview. ?�That it has some meaningful indication as to how a corporation is being managed is superficial at best.??Shoen said he regularly speaks with entry level U-Haul employees to gain diverse perspectives.

wealth,Investor Legal & General backs activist in Exxon proxy battle," HOUSTON, May 11 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest asset manager, Legal & General, on Tuesday said it will vote for an activist hedge fund's board slate at Exxon Mobil's Top U.S. oil producer Exxon is battling hedge fund Engine No. 1 over four seats on its 12-member board and the direction of the company. The fund has criticized Exxon's poor returns, spending on fossil fuels and lack of clear plans for the energy transition. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) owns Exxon shares worth nearly $1 billion, according to Refinitiv data. It disclosed its voting plans in a blog on Tuesday. Exxon's annual shareholders meeting will be held on May 26. LGIM also opposed the reelection to the board of Exxon's chief executive, Darren Woods, and lead independent director Kenneth Frazier, and backs the separation of the CEO and chairman roles, John Hoeppner, head of U.S. stewardship and sustainable investments at LGIM, said in an interview. LGIM will vote for Engine No. 1's nominees - Gregory Goff, Anders Runevad, Kaisa Hietala and Alexander Karsner - he said. The Engine No. 1 slate also has support from large pension funds in California and New York. ""We think they have a good, complementary set of experiences that would be in the best interest of the long-term shareholders,"" Hoeppner said. Exxon's current board is full of ""incredibly accomplished CEOs"" but lacks people who understand oil and gas and the energy transition, and who have overseen business transformation, Hoeppner said. Exxon did not comment but pointed to a Monday letter to shareholders that said its directors ""bring valuable expertise in capital allocation across industries, complex corporate transitions, the energy industry, investor perspectives, Asia-Pacific markets and environmental, social and governance,"" practices. LGIM has ""very rarely, if ever,"" spoken with Exxon's directors and has not found that its board offers ""the same level of board-level buy-in that we see in other organizations,"" Hoeppner said. LGIM last year voted against CEO Woods and in favor of an independent chairman. It has signed onto the Net Zero Asset Managers??Initiative, which vows to press portfolio companies to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Exxon has not set 2050 net zero targets as European peers have done. To try to address investor concerns on climate, in recent months it has expanded its board, pledged to increase spending on lower-carbon initiatives and said it would lower the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions.

wealth,Britain lowers NatWest stake with $1.5 billion share sale," LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - The British government has completed the sale of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion) in shares of NatWest UK Government Investments (UKGI), the state-owned company that controls the shares, said the they were priced at 190 pence, 4% below Monday's closing price of 197 pence. NatWest has been majority state-owned following a 45 billion-pound bailout in 2008 during the financial crisis. The sale crystallises a further hefty loss of around 1.8 billion for taxpayers, with shares well below the 502 pence bailout level. The move edges the bank closer to private ownership, reducing the government's holding from 60% previously. The government's last sale of stock to outside investors was in 2018, although NatWest directly bought back 1.1 billion pound of shares last month to reduce the state's holding from 62%. NatWest shares fell around 4% in early trading to around the latest sale price. They are also below the 2018 sale price of 271 pence a share. The government said it continued to keep all options and timings under review for future sales. NatWest's stock price has more than doubled since hitting a low of 90.5 pence in September, as optimism has built about prospects for Britain's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, has long argued it is unrealistic to expect a profit on the bank's rescue, which was needed to stabilise Britain's financial system.

wealth,Factbox: Global big banks plot back-to-office plans as vaccines roll out," Sept 14 (Reuters) - The biggest banks in the world plan to reopen their offices, emboldened by aggressive vaccination drives and falling COVID-19 cases in major financial hubs, after sending most employees home early last year to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. The COVID-19 Delta variant's spread is prompting some firms to rethink their back-to-office plans, but many of Wall Street's biggest banks are sticking to their decision to bring back employees. Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions: UNITED STATES Wells Fargo & Co The bank has pushed back its U.S. return-to-office date to Nov. 1. Goldman Sachs Group Inc The bank planned to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June. JPMorgan Chase & Co The largest U.S. bank has brought back employees in the United States to the office on a rotational basis from July. [USN:L4N2MK3UL][USN:L4N2MY3GD] Citigroup Inc The bank expects vaccinated employees in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and D.C. to start working from office for at least two days a week starting Sept. 13. For other corporate offices across the United States, Citi will continue to monitor data. Morgan Stanley The bank's chief executive officer, James Gorman, said if most employees are not back to work at the bank's Manhattan headquarters in September, he will be ""very disappointed"". Gorman said his bank's policy will vary by location, noting the firm's 2,000 employees in India will not return to offices this year. Bank of America Corp The bank will only allow vaccinated staff to return to its offices in early September, while encouraging other employees to get inoculated. UNITED KINGDOM Barclays CEO Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York. HSBC Holdings HSBC has adopted a new hybrid working model, with a 10% reduction in its global real estate footprint since the start of 2020. HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40%. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns. Lloyds Banking Group Britain's biggest domestic bank expects there will be three ways of working - at home, in the office, or a combination of the two - from October. The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years. Standard Chartered StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years. Nine of the bank's markets, including the UK, have been on flexible working contracts for a few months. NatWest CEO Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate. The bank will adopt its new ways of working over the summer, with the majority of staff in England and Wales expected to be back in the office from September, dependent on government and public health advice, a spokesperson said. GERMANY Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank in London had plans to bring more staff back from June 21, assuming the city's lockdown restrictions were loosened, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Germany's largest lender has also told its U.S. investment bankers that it expects them to resume working from office no later than Labor Day, according to a memo seen by Reuters.

Return-to-office plans vary from region to region, in accordance with local government guidelines. CANADA Bank of Canada The central bank will allow most of its staff to remotely clock in as much as half of their working hours once public health guidelines allow it to fully reopen offices, a spokesperson said.

wealth,"Analysis: Fund managers see value, cyclical stocks running further despite slow U.S. jobs recovery"," NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - While some technology stocks got a boost Friday after a disappointing U.S. jobs report, some portfolio managers say that blow-out earnings from several large technology companies over the last few weeks are not enough to keep making outsized bets on the sector. Instead, those fund managers say that they are continuing to rotate into value and cyclical stocks - whose fortunes are closely tied to economic conditions - in anticipation that the economic recovery will be longer and more gradual than originally anticipated. The notion that the U.S. jobs recovery has not yet peaked was reinforced by data from the Labor Department on Friday that showed U.S. employers hired far fewer workers than anticipated. The lower-than-expected job gains are likely to keep the Federal Reserve's accommodative measures in place for an extended period, economists said. The transition between the stay-at-home economy and a full reopening will likely take at least a year, leaving value stocks more attractive than technology shares over that time, said Barry James, a portfolio manager at James Investment Research, who remains underweight in technology. ""In the short run, it may bounce back and forth but we think we are in for at least another year or more of this transition,"" he said. Large technology stocks rallied Friday after the jobs report tampered concerns about inflation and pushed the yield of the 10-year Treasury near a 2-month low, but the direction of the economy regains intact and should continue to favor cyclical stocks over defensive stocks, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""We would not read too much into any one jobs report, and continue to think the labor market remains on track and will be more than enough to underpin consumer confidence and consumption,"" he said. Despite Friday's gains, large-cap technology companies continue to lag the broad market. Apple Inc Instead, value companies in such cyclical areas such as financials, energy, and consumer discretionary are surging. The Russell 1000 Value index ""You had some people saying, that is as good as it gets across the board. Peak momentum, peak growth, peak earnings, but the market is misperceiving the backdrop here. You are going to end up with robust levels of growth for the remainder of this year,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist and portfolio manager at Natixis Advisors. Funds that have remained heavy in growth stocks jumped Friday, with the ARK Innovation ETF At the same time, the stretched valuation of large technology companies makes them less attractive than cyclical stocks that will most likely see the greatest economic boost over the next year, said George Young, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co. The S&P 500 technology sector, for example, trades at 33.8 times trailing earnings, more than double that of the S&P 500 financial sector, which trades at 16.2 times trailing earnings. Young has been adding to his position in cyclical companies like casino company Caesars Entertainment Inc ""People are turning the corner and saying 'We can see the light at the end of the tunnel and we don't have to say at home anymore,' so investors are looking for what's the next thing,"" he said.

Lufthansa and the banks, the lead advisers on the deal, declined to comment. Lufthansa shareholders this month approved a potential capital increase of up to 5.5 billion euros, though finance chief Remco Steenbergen has said that was just the sum of the two tranches of hybrid capital, dubbed silent participation, it received as part of a 2020 bailout. ""The actual increase will be lower than that and is really dependent on what we see the need to be at the moment we decide to issue,"" he has said. Capital markets needed to be supportive and the airline's plans to divest units such as LSG, AirPlus and Lufthansa Technik also needed to be taken into account when determining the size of the capital increase, he has said. The travel industry's hopes for a post-pandemic recovery have been hit by many false starts, beset by new restrictions, virus variant outbreaks and a sluggish European vaccine rollout. Lufthansa only expects to fly at about 40% of its pre-pandemic capacity in 2021, but it has raised its number of holiday destinations to over 100, banking on surging demand as vaccination campaigns reach a large number of people.

wealth,Yale chief investment officer Swensen dies of cancer," BOSTON, May 6 (Reuters) - David Swensen, who spent more than three decades managing one of the world's best performing college endowments as Yale University's chief investment officer, has died of cancer, the university said. ""David served our university with distinction. He was an exceptional colleague, a dear friend, and a beloved mentor to many in our community. Future generations will benefit from his dedication, brilliance, and generosity,"" Yale President Peter Salovey said in a statement. He was 67 and was first diagnosed with cancer in 2012. Over three decades Swensen helped the university's endowment grow to $31.2 billion, making Yale one of the world's richest universities. The endowment helps fund salaries and financial aid. Salovey said Swensen ""revolutionized"" institutional investing by shifting the university's money into less liquid asset classes and helped prepare a new generation of investors who have gone on to lead other large endowments. Swensen, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Yale, returned to his alma mater in 1985 after having worked on Wall Street for several years. He took a significant pay cut to lead the investment office and found an endowment valued at $1 billion. By focusing on a longtime horizon, Swensen pioneered investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate, creating an investment model now known as the ""Yale Model."" His record is one of the most admired in the industry. Yale returned 9.9% a year over the 20 years ending June 30, 2020, while other college and university endowments earned an average 5.6% return. In 2000, when the tech bubble burst, Yale's endowment posted a 41% return, thanks largely to a hedge to dampen its exposure to technology investments. Swensen also trained a new generation of investors in his classes at Yale and in the investment office who went on to lead endowments at Princeton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford.

wealth,ARK Innovation's performance under pressure as tech stocks swoon," NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - A rotation out of growth and technology stocks and a recent slide in shares of Tesla Inc The $23.1 billion fund posted a gain of less than 1% last month, a showing nearly 3 percentage points behind the average fund in its category, according to Morningstar data. For the year to date, the fund is down 9%, a performance that puts it in the bottom 100th percentile in Morningstar's category of 543 mid-cap growth funds. The S&P 500 Investors pulled $645.5 million out of the fund during the week that ended April 21, a 2.6% decline that was its largest weekly outflow in percentage terms since 2018 and only the fifth weekly loss overall since 2019, according to Refinitiv Lipper. The fund brought in $37 million the following week, the smallest weekly inflow in percentage terms since January 2020. Among the factors denting the fund is a rally in shares of financials, energy firms and other companies that stand to benefit from a powerful U.S. economic rebound that has made the growth and tech stocks that dominated last year less alluring to some investors. The Russell 1000 Value index Shares of Tesla, which make up 10.5% of the fund and are its biggest holding, are down 4.5% since the start of the year, contributing to the fund's slide.

wealth,Analysis: Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds as shareholders look to its future," NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - For some Berkshire Hathaway shareholders a list of post-pandemic challenges including looming inflation, a dearth of acquisitions and more environmental and social disclosure demands are prompting a rethink on Warren Buffett?�s conglomerate. Making money at Berkshire used to be like ?�shooting fish in a barrel,??Buffett?�s long-time business partner Charlie Munger said at its ""But that's gotten harder,"" Munger added. Investors have long been happy to bet on Buffett outperforming markets, and many remain confident Berkshire's growth will pick up if the U.S. economy continues roaring back from its pandemic-induced slump. But some worry the last year may have exacerbated Berkshire's difficulties delivering faster growth. ""We have been reducing our position in Berkshire for a number of years because it appears that we can make more money than he can,"" said Bill Smead, whose firm, Seattle-based Smead Capital Management has lowered its Berkshire holdings to about 2.2% of its $2.5 billion portfolio, from 5% a decade ago. With unprecedented government stimulus and rock bottom interest rates threatening to lift inflation, Berkshire may be too big to pivot heavily to companies that could benefit from rising consumer prices, Smead said. Several Berkshire shareholders expressed frustration that Buffett did not snap up more shares of companies at the beginning of the pandemic, a missed opportunity given the S&P 500's nearly 90% surge from last year's low. Steve Haberstroh, a partner at Berkshire shareholder CastleKeep Investment Advisors, said this was ?�frustrating?? although he was gratified when it announced Another issue hampering Berkshire's ability to generate money is historically low interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has pledged to leave at near-zero for years. Berkshire now earns about $20 million annually on its more than $100 billion in Treasury bills, compared with about $1.5 billion before the pandemic, Buffett said. ""Imagine your wage is going from $15 an hour to $0.20 an hour,"" Buffett said. Still, Berkshire has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date, gaining 18.6% versus the index?�s 11.84% gain. But it has trailed over the past decade, returning nearly 236% compared with just over 277% for the index. As the economy improves, Berkshire is poised to benefit, said James Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. ""If it has a challenge, it relates to capital deployment,"" he said. Berkshire's $145.4 billion cash hoard could swell by $25 billion by year end, he said. Buffett said he would like to put $70 billion to $80 billion to work through acquisitions. But the growth of special purpose acquisition companies, which take private companies public, has made buying whole companies SUCCESSION PLANS Among the biggest reasons for Berkshire's success is the relationship between Buffett, 90, and Munger, 97, and the business culture they cultivate. Both expressed confidence in Berkshire's ability to stay on course without them, and had Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, join them on stage at the annual gathering. ""This decentralization won't work unless you have the right kind of culture accompanying it,"" Buffett said about Berkshire. ""Greg will keep the culture,"" Munger said of Abel. After the meeting, Buffett ended long-running speculation about by telling CNBC that Abel, who oversees Berkshire?�s non-insurance businesses, would be ""The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who?�d take over tomorrow morning,"" Buffett said. Robert Miles, a shareholder who teaches a class on Buffett and Berkshire at The University of Nebraska, called Abel and Jain's presence at the meeting ""a real value-add."" Jain said he and Abel talk every quarter about businesses they oversee. Abel addressed Berkshire's efforts around environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, with two shareholder proposals asking the board to publish annual reports on how each of its units addressed them. Berkshire opposed the proposals, citing its decentralized business model. Both were rejected, but received support from around one quarter of the votes cast, suggesting greater discontent than Berkshire shareholders historically have demonstrated. ""These are complex topics that warrant ongoing dialogue,"" said Caitlin McSherry, Director of Investment Stewardship at Neuberger Berman, a shareholder that backed the proposals. Smead, of Smead Capital Management, looks forward to when Berkshire will again become a frequent buyer of choice for companies looking to sell. ""We would (add) where they are back to shooting fish in a barrel,"" he said.

wealth,Broker Robinhood upbraids Buffett over casino comparison," May 3 (Reuters) - Robinhood Financial on Monday struck back against comments by Warren Buffett that likened the retail brokerage to a casino that encourages millions of inexperienced day traders to place short-term stock market bets. At Berkshire Hathaway Inc's ""If the last year has taught us anything, it is that people are tired of the Warren Buffetts and Charlie Mungers of the world acting like they are the only oracles of investing,"" Robinhood's Head of Public Policy Communications, Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, said in a ""And at Robinhood, we're not going to sit back while they disparage everyday people for taking control of their financial lives."" Buffett and Munger made their comments after Berkshire shareholder Robert Miles asked them what they thought of Robinhood and other retail brokers enabling people of all ages and experience to participate in the market. Miles said he did not think their responses were meant to disparage Robinhood users. ""They're trying to dissuade people from making money through trading, which Charlie (Munger) said is not how they made their money. They made their money by investing,"" he said in an interview. Buffett specifically pointed to the high volume of short-term options bets on Apple Inc's  stock, and compared the practice to playing the state lottery, which he said was ""taxing hope."" ""He said it wasn't immoral, it's just in his opinion not very wise,"" said Miles, who teaches a class on Buffett at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. Robinhood also traded barbs with Munger in February, calling him elitist, after the 97-year-old investor said the brokerage encouraged gambling in stocks. Brokers like Robinhood have attracted controversy this year as retail traders drove huge rallies in shares of companies like GameStop Corp During a Feb. 18 congressional hearing on the matter, lawmakers slammed Robinhood's ""gamification"" of stock trading on mobile phones through things like a virtual confetti celebration following a big trade. Robinhood later removed the confetti animation from its app. Massachusetts regulators in April sought to revoke Robinhood's broker-dealer license, saying it encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades without limits, while the brokerage sued to invalidate  underlying the case. While some people do gamble on stocks, it is far more socially beneficial than going to the racetrack, because when they do so, they add capital, liquidity and risk-bearing capacity to the market, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.

wealth,U.S. Supreme Court refuses to revive Wells Fargo accounts scandal suit," May 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rebuffed a bid by current and former employees of Wells Fargo & Co The justices declined to hear an appeal by the employees of a lower court ruling that threw out their proposed class action case against San Francisco-based Wells Fargo under a federal law requiring careful management of private-sector retirement plans. The case centered on the fallout from revelations, beginning in 2016, that Wells Fargo employees opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts after pressure by the bank to meet unrealistic sales goals. Wells Fargo in 2020 agreed to pay $3 billion to settle a joint investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department. Participants in Wells Fargo's 401(k) retirement plan funds that invested in the company's own stock sued the bank and the plan's administrators in 2016 in federal court in Minnesota, accusing them of breaching their duty to act prudently under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The employees who filed suit said the administrators did nothing to halt Wells Fargo's fraudulent practices or protect the plan from the fallout, such as by disclosing the problem to the public. Instead, the employees said in court papers, the plan kept purchasing Wells Fargo stock. After the revelations in September 2016, the plan lost $1 billion, the employees said in court papers. Under a 2014 Supreme Court precedent aimed at weeding out meritless litigation whenever a company's stock price drops, plaintiffs must show that a prudent administrator faced with insider information would have considered an alternative course of action. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 threw out the case, finding that the employees had not adequately shown that prudent fund managers would have erred on the side of earlier disclosure. The Supreme Court in 2020 issued a ruling involving a similar lawsuit by participants in IBM Corp's Our Standards: A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that New York state cannot impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on healthcare workers without allowing their employers to consider religious exemption requests."
wealth,Buffett and Munger heap criticism on Robinhood for casino-like atmosphere," May 1 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday likened the millions of inexperienced day traders who entered the stock market in the past year to gamblers, and said commission-free brokerages such as Robinhood Financial for promoted a casino-like atmosphere. Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual meeting ""There is nothing illegal to it, there's nothing immoral, but I don't think you build a society around people doing it,"" he said. Buffett's long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, was more harsh. ""It's just god-awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized man and decent citizens,"" he said. ""It's deeply wrong. We don't want to make our money selling things that are bad for people."" Buffett said that while the odds of profiting from day trading stocks and derivatives are better than playing the state lottery, many new investors would have better results buying and holding shares of good companies. ""The gambling impulse is very strong in people worldwide and occasionally it gets an enormous shove,"" Buffett said. ""It creates its own reality for a while, and nobody tells you when the clock is going to strike 12 and it all turns to pumpkins and mice,"" he said. Some critics have said free trading platforms can encourage millennials to view trading as a game or amusement. Brokers like Robinhood Financial have attracted controversy this year as traders drove huge rallies in shares of video game retailer GameStop Corp Some of the buying was fueled by chats on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets to ostensibly to punish hedge funds that had bet against so-called meme stocks. Robinhood faces many lawsuits over its decision in January to curb trading in GameStop and other stocks, and Massachusetts is seeking to revoke its broker-dealer license.

Texas-based Mr. Cooper, which is the largest U.S. non-bank mortgage servicer, announced an unauthorized April 24 discovery of duplicate-payment drafts from some of its borrowers' bank accounts in a ""The CFPB is taking immediate action to understand and resolve the situation that has affected hundreds of thousands of consumers.

wealth,Goldman's digital hedge-fund matchmaking push boosted by lockdowns," April 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' long-planned online migration of some lucrative prime-brokerage businesses picked up steam during the pandemic as hedge funds and investors working from home were unable to meet in person, while other Wall Street banks are taking more measured steps. Last July, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Humans have long handled capital introduction services, in which third parties like banks attempt to matchmake investors with hedge funds. But as large swathes of other bank services have moved to virtual platforms, banks have been increasingly looking at how to move some of these services online too. Hedge fund managers and investors on Goldman's Marquee Connect, for example, create profiles that allocators can use to search for the funds that fit their targets. Over the past nine months, the application has signed up over 900 hedge funds, more than 600 investor firms and made 4,500-plus connections, executives in Goldman's prime brokerage team told Reuters. ""While we?�ve been working on developing Marquee Connect in conjunction with our clients for a few years, the timing of our launch... was fortuitous,"" said Isabella Meyer, a member of the capital introduction team and project lead on Marquee Connect, adding that the work-from-home trend accelerated usage. Other prime brokers told Reuters that while they had not yet launched a similar product, efforts at looking at how to move some services online may be underway. ""Jefferies continues to leverage technology to facilitate supply and demand between managers and investors which includes considerations to certain functionalities being brought online,??said Leor Shapiro, Managing Director and Global Head of Capital Intelligence at Jefferies. Mike Monforth, global head of capital advisory at JP Morgan Chase Citi, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse declined to comment. One of the key parts of capital introduction matchmaking is often conferences in which hedge funds and investors get to meet face to face. The pandemic forced that aspect online, drawing greater participation. Shapiro at Jefferies said its flagship conference went from around 200 investor attendees in the previous year to roughly 300 during the pandemic. Monforth at JP Morgan said the bank last year put on 47 events with over 5,500 participants compared to 43 events and 1400 participants the previous year. Hedge funds have raised more money with the shift online, adding $844 billion in capital since March 2020, with $6.1 billion in new investor cash in the first quarter of 2021, according to data from Hedge Fund Research (HFR). Despite all the benefits touted of using virtual tools, prime brokers admit investors and hedge funds are keen to get back to in-person meetings. ""There is a bit of Zoom fatigue,"" said Monforth at JP Morgan, adding that virtual meetings were here for the long term alongside face-to-face interactions. Goldman Sachs' Diana Dieckman, global head of the capital introduction team within prime services, said: ""There're all these now tools out there now, but that doesn't replace in-person, so it will be a hybrid approach going forward.""

wealth,White House says capital gains tax would hit 0.3% of taxpayers," WASHINGTON, April 26 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden?�s forthcoming capital gains tax hike proposal would affect only a 0.3% slice of U.S. taxpayers, a top economic aide said on Monday. Biden is set this week to propose nearly doubling taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, Reuters has reported, in what would be the highest tax rate on investment gains since the 1920s. The soon-to-be-announced tax hike will treat those investment gains as wages for top earners and applies only to about 500,000 households, according to Brian Deese, who runs Biden's policy-writing National Economic Council. ""We need to do something about equalizing the taxation of work and wealth in this country,"" Deese told reporters. ""And that's why the reforms that the president will lay out are focused on this top sliver of people."" He said there is no evidence of a significant impact of those capital gains tax rates on long-term investment. Still, wealth advisers have That political process and widespread business group opposition is widely expected to mean a lower tax rate than the White House initially proposes will ultimately be adopted. Currently, people earning more than $200,000 pay a capital gains rate of about 23.8%, including the 3.8% net investment tax which helps fund the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Under the new plan, wealthy Americans could face an overall federal capital gains tax rate of 43.4% including the Obamacare tax.

wealth,"Analysis: For Google, plenty of cash with nowhere to go"," April 28 (Reuters) - In announcing a $50-billion share buyback on Tuesday, Google-owner Alphabet Inc Alphabet reported record earnings on Tuesday, leaving its cash pile at about $135 billion, up $18 billion over the last year. A But antitrust investigators in the United States and elsewhere allege that Google gained dominance in online ads using anti-competitive practices, and lawsuits are piling up. That could leave Google wary of spending its money on big acquisitions that are related to its existing businesses, as they would likely be blocked on antitrust grounds. ""Fears of an increased regulatory clampdown on the company might have seen Alphabet tread more carefully when deciding what to do with their cash pile,"" said Samuel Indyk, analyst at uk.Investing.com. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat on Tuesday did not rule out making deals, though. ""Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments,"" she told analysts. Betting on unrelated businesses, while easier from a regulatory standpoint, would be unlikely to yield anything close to the returns enjoyed by Google. And spending on internal projects has limits too: Alphabet has sunk tens of billions into the its ""other bets,"" including autonomous vehicle company Waymo and blue-sky projects such as failed internet service Loon, but few are close to being viable businesses. Like many fast-growing tech companies, Alphabet has never paid a dividend, preferring instead to return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Alphabet bought back $31 billion in shares in 2020, 69% more than the year before, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. The 2020 buyback amounted to 73% of its free cash flow, up from 59% in 2019, he said. Unlike dividends, which can lock a company into long-term fixed payouts to shareholders that are difficult to reduce, buybacks also give Alphabet the flexibility to adjust the flow of cash returned to investors at any time if it needs the money for other purposes. Some analysts say Alphabet shares are priced low relative to peers. Alphabet shares trade at about eight times sales over the last year, while shares of Facebook Inc Taking some shares off the market and stoking prices through the buyback, one of the largest ever on Wall Street and almost twice the company's previous highest authorization, could help close the gap with rivals. ""This (buyback) is a sign their stock is undervalued and a tougher regulatory environment for M&A,"" Thill said. Alphabet shares rose as much as 6.1% to touch a record high of $2,431.38 on Wednesday. Company leadership would benefit from higher shares under their new compensation plans. Five senior executives including Porat over the last year received stock awards that will vest, if at all, based on how Alphabet shares perform relative to the S&P 100 in the coming years. Alphabet is far from the only company with plenty of cash and antitrust and other challenges hampering its potential use. Apple Inc Share buybacks have been rising, both in the amount of repurchases and the number of companies doing them, though activity remains below pre-pandemic levels. About one-third of S&P 500 companies have issued quarterly results as of Tuesday, reporting $52 billion in buybacks in the first quarter, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. Those companies reported $42.8 billion in buybacks in the fourth quarter. The calculation on buybacks versus dividends could change with U.S. President Joe Biden?�s new tax proposals, which aim to boost the levy on capital gains from stock investments but leave taxes on dividends and interest unchanged.
